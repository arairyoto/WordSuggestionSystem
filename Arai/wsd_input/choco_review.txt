this is one of those  bars that really tastes like a  bar the tasting notes say that its bark is worse than its bite but im not convinced that is the case it is very bold aggressive and hard to do anything with except nibble tentatively rather than the promised antique oak i get lots of harsh whisky notes that are not very pleasant their other lower percentage saint lucian bars are much better and i cant help but think some sugar would mellow this right out having had bars made from conacado beans before this was a bit of a surprise because this was a lot more robust than i was expecting again theres some whisky with big coffee notes thrown in  it starts strong and stays strong with just a few fruitier hints right at the end not bad at all but still one best enjoyed in small doses this is the pick of the trio because it doesnt possess any of those overly hard edges that the other two did the chocolate has a smooth earthiness that slowly gives way to a red wine richness that lingers for quite a while leaving behind a wonderfully rich chocolaty taste it is surprisingly moreish for a  bar and well worth seeking out so the world of  chocolate is still a mixed bag which isnt for the meek but it does pay dividends if you are willing to take the plungewhen are you going to try duffys  his is from peru toono comparison duffys is in a totally different classyoure making me hungry and everyone knows here that chocolate and whisky make a perfect combo i max out at  percent cant get anywhere near a  percent for now i appreciate the experience shared though however after  glasses of whisky who knows if i was completely sober youd have to tie me to a tree im just saying
the wonderful thing is that theyve managed to come up with a set of destinations and chocolates that fulfil both criteria and theyre really rather good they arefrom the descriptions alone you can tell how much work has gone into this collection but as is often the case with paul a youngs chocolates the flavours themselves are surprising delightful and deliciousi love all these chocolates both for the flavour combinations and the meanings behind the chocolates stand outs for me are the london gin  tonic chocolate the new york which really does taste like a cheesecake and venice with its creamy texture and subtle limoncello flavouras if creating a unique collection of chocolates wasnt enough you can also buy this pink praline brownie im fairly certain the inspiration for this came from chocolate maker pralus famous praluline  a brioche loaf stuffed with sweet pink praline pieces the pralus brioche is one of my favourite foods in the world and theyve been replicated faithfully in this brownieif i have a problem with it its simply that there arent enough praline pieces and its difficult to see them so they dont have quite the visual impact the brioche has thats a minor issue though and like most paul a young brownies this one is delicious and the praline adds both texture and flavour to the mixfinally for those who like the traditional there are solid milk and dark chocolate hearts decorated with gold and silver leaf theyre very pretty but if youre thinking of buying me a valentines gift id much rather have the destinations box of chocolates  pleasesounds wonderfullove dark chocolate
the box is divided into two layers the first layer contains zchocolats signature chocolate range fifteen numbered chocolates these chocolates  a range of pralines and ganaches form zchocolats core range and are made with a mix of venezuelan and ivory coast origin chocolate the second layer consists of  chocolate hearts theres a dark chocolate ganache in a white chocolate shell a milk chocolate hazelnut praline a dark chocolate with vanilla caramel and a redpainted white chocolate heart with bergamot ganacheall the chocolates in this collection are well made and tasty but the thing you really need to know is the price these  chocolates will set you back a cool  if youre judging it on the chocolate alone thats over  per chocolate and for that money you really could find better quality chocolates elsewherebut that kind of misses the point these arent chocolates you buy to eat yourself you buy them to give as a spectacular valentines gift when you want to make a real impression with someone you love you could almost say that the chocolates themselves are secondary to the packaging a visually stunning collection and a box theyll want to keep foreverin fact with all the optional extras available everything from wrapping engraving and even a concierge service you could take the cost of this box to well over  theres no doubt its a spectacular gift but overdo it and it might start to look like you have more money than taste that said if you can afford them zchocolats boxes do make a great gift youre not getting the best chocolate in the world but theyre tasty enough and the presentation is truly wonderfuli do not recommend using them one word of advice when shipping luxury goods internationally  make sure the vendor has an established partnership with a shipping vendor and is not someone who casually calculates delivery time like zchocolates does you can take my advice or give your delivery one month variation to get the goods which in case of perishables you might not get the best product or even worse you might ship a valentines day gift in marchi ordered chocolates for a family event paid more than other competitors are charging on the promise my order will be there on time with one week of time ahead of the event and paying extra for the delivery to get to the destination at the given date i relied on zchocolates to be able to manage their logistics they failed big time and not only have they missed their promissed delivery date by more than two days they never assumed responsibility for their failure to manage their logistics every email i received from them blames everyone but their failure to manage their shipment and estimate their logisticsto make things worse they dont mention that customs fees are not calculated in their quote when you are charged so your gift recipient has to pay extra money when she receives the giftone thing i should have done and i did not is google the phrase zchocolat reviews to see the vendor has dropped the ball before the same way and they have not improvedps this post has  been deleted from this blog twice already it tells me the blog is not neutral in its reviews and the review is an advertisement please share this post if you see it i typically do not leave negative comments but it seems like a lot of valentine days will be ruined if people order from zchocolat and the company fails in their service like they did with medear ilijawe would have been more than pleased to refund the customs fee since you had not been informed about this however since we could not reach your gift recipients and the occasion had passed we agreed to have your order refunded and the package was subsequently returned to our offices i understand that this was a terrible experience for you and i would like to extend all my apologies for the distress and prejudice it caused warmest regardsjulia from zchocolat
in addition to replenishing my stash of their wonderful dark fire chocolate i was getting a little twitchy not having some in the house for emergencies she also got me one of their special chocolate twigs that they make just for the festive season this year they had coconut caramel with maldon salt mudslide with kahlua baileys and whisky and pineapple ginger which is the one i was giventhe twig came very well disguised in a cardboard mailing tube making it hard to know just what was hiding within whilst the name conjures up mental images of slim slightly irregular chocolate fingers that wasnt the case when i opened up the tube  these really arent very twiglike at all instead there was a single chunky bar of chocolate between six or seven inches in length and an inch wide more a plank than a twig but thats just splitting hairs or logstheres a lot to take in from the outside with this particular variety one side is very knobbly thanks to a layer of souffletine  those small crisp cereal balls  which adds plenty of crunch to the bar but the real stars here are those advertised on the outside the pineapple and the ginger because they are the things that dominate the proceedingsthe chocolate is nice and dark  no percentage stated but im thinking about   but it isnt one of somas big bold chocolates because it is happy enough to hold back and let the added stuff do the heavy lifting ginger is the most obvious flavour with its distinctive tingle and then after a bit of chewing theres the sweetness of pineapple sharing the spotlight it is a great combination that i wouldnt necessarily associate with christmas as it made me think more of sunnier tropical climes which isnt a bad thing to be thinking about during a canadian winter it is definitely the kind of bar which needs to be nibbled rather than eaten in one sitting because it is a little on the sweet side plus the dimensions of the twig make it easier to cut chunks off with a knife rather that bite at it might even be designed to be shared but sharing somas chocolate isnt always the first thing that comes to my mind at leastthis sounds amaaazing
brewed cocoa seems to be a bit of a thing right now the idea is simple make a cocoa drink in the same way youd usually make coffee so rather than use chocolate or cocoa powder you simply let cocoa nibs and sometimes shells infuse in hot waterthe crio br were kind enough to send me four different varieties to try along with a french press to make them in simply put a couple of tablespoonfuls into the press add hot water stir and leave to steep before servingcrio br recommends steeping for  minutes but in practice i found that a little too long having had brewed cocoa drinks in the past the thing i noticed immediately about crio br was just how finely ground the beans are this is really important as a finer grind means a higher surface area and a quicker fuller brew i prefer a lighter cocoa drink so for my tastes  minutes was enoughthe other thing that comes through right away is that the beans are roasted quite heavily im sure thats a deliberate attempt to appeal to coffee drinkers who like that fuller roasted flavour but i would have preferred something a little more gentle that said each variety had its own characteristics and flavouri added a spoonful of sugar to each cup which i suggest doing just to take the bitter edge off the drinkthis one has the most interesting and complex flavours but also the highest roast there are some great fruity notes in this venezuelan cacao but the high roast means it just tastes burnt to me id love a lighter roast version of this onea less complex cacao but the slightly lower roast makes this my favourite of the group id still prefer a slightly lower roast but this one makes a really quite pleasant pickmeupsimple chocolatey flavours with a slightly bitter roasted edge that a little sugar helps to even out quite coffeelike in flavoura higher roast version of the ivory coast drink for me the most interesting aspect of this one is just how much like a roasted coffee it tastes all in all i love the idea of crio br but id like to see some varieties with milder roasts before id buy it myself i could add more sugar or a little milk to my drinks but personally i love the natural flavours in cacao and id rather not cover them upif youre into coffee with a strongly roasted flavour and want to try something a bit different youll almost certainly love them though brewed cocoa is definitely the futurei never knew you can brew cocoa nibs i sometimes get those from my veganraw foodist friends and sometimes i dont know what to do with them so i end up with a lot of leftovers i want to try this im not really a coffee drinker and our coffeemaker at home is just gathering dust well thanks to this post i know have an idea
these days it seems that no matter where you go there is someone making beantobar chocolate and that is a wonderful thing so when i was recently down in north carolina for a conference i just happened to stumble upon some local bean to bar chocolate without even tryingit is a single origin bar with the carenero beans coming from just east of caracus  they might not be the most beloved beans from venezuela but they still have some of the same fruity notes the chocolate itself has a tiny bit of grittiness to it  something which i actually like and feel is a good match for rustic flavour of the goat milk ultimately it all comes down to how you feel about the goat milk here if you can take the goatiness because it is the star of the show then this is a creamy delightful bar of chocolate but i can understand how some people might be a little underwhelmed by a dark milk bar where dairy dominates over cacaocomments are closed
sometimes though its an awful lot of trouble to go to particularly when im just in the mood for something comforting i dont want to spend half an hour in the kitchen when i get home on a freezing december evening i just want a big mug of hot chocolate and if i have to wait longer than two minutes i start to get really quite grumpythe lovely people at g sent me all three flavours to try regular hot chocolate salted caramel and mocha flavours and they really are quick simple and satisfyingg recommend pouring heating the drinks in a jug in the microwave then transferring to your favourite mug so thats what i did for my first test doing it in a jug let me give the drink a quick whisk before serving but i found that even this added valuable seconds to the preparation time so when it came to trying the other two flavours i just heated them directly in the mugthe verdict i like them theyre made with whole milk and have a nice creamy texture its not too thick and importantly not too sweet i enjoyed all the flavours but the salted caramel was the winner for me and i suspect that will end up being the best seller the flavour balance is spot on and i quickly found myself going back for morethe downside of having hot chocolate in cartons is that you could very quickly find it takes up all the space in the fridge particularly at this time of year for me thats a small price to pay for the convenience of having a great tasting hot chocolate available on demand who needs fresh food anyway rightcomments are closed
first a word about the packaging it looks quite attractive with a modern feel combined with traditional mayanlooking designs in the shops these bars will have to compete with the likes of lindt and i certainly think they have the edge over the competitionthe card wrappers are really easy to open but my one complaint here is that they dont seem to be resealable in any way once opened up the box cant be stuck back down and the sealed inner foil has to be torn open a minor complaint but im never going to eat a whole g bar in one go so it would be nice to be able to close the pack up after taking a squarei thought id start my tasting session with the two unflavoured bars in the collectionthis is obviously quite a high cocoa percentage but that seems to be the trend for some of the higher end mass market brands these days the first thing i noticed when i opened it though was the strong aroma of vanilla which i found a little disappointingtraditionally vanilla is added to chocolate to cover up any bad flavours but with a finer flavour cocoa like these bars use it shouldnt strictly be necessary  at least not to the extent that its been used herethat vanilla comes through in the taste too although thankfully not as strong as the aroma in fact it turns out to be quite a pleasant and munchable dark chocolate theres little in the way of bitterness and although theres quite a strong cocoa powder flavour you do get just a hint of natural fruitiness its not much but its there its certainly much nicer than the equivalent high percentage lindt barsalthough the flavour is a little more milk than it is chocolate and there isnt much complexity to it i still enjoyed this bar its not too sweet and its very pleasant to nibble onthis bar pictured above is made with the same milk chocolate with the addition of candied orange peel and orange oil im never quite sure about orange chocolate because it always ends up reminding me of terrys chocolate orange  something i used to quite like but now find sweet and sicklythis bar is still a little orangey for me despite being made with natural ingredients i always find the combination of chocolate and orange tastes a little artificial not really my cup of tea but a step up from the old fashioned chocolate orange i know many people who will love this onethis bar again uses the same milk chocolate this time with just a touch of salt there may be just  salt in this bar but it lifts the flavour wonderfully its somehow more chocolatey and even a little sweeter i liked this one a lota slightly sweeter dark chocolate with crunchy cocoa nibs theres a sweetness and very subtle fruitiness to this chocolate but its not particularly complex whats clear is that a lot of thought has gone into the amount of sugar in the chocolate the result is a nice balance of sweetness and intensity and a very munchable dark chocolatecertainly the most unusual flavour of this collection but also my favourite the small pieces of rosemary in this bar have been sugared to give a great crunch while taking off the savoury edge from what from this strongly flavoured herbthe result is something that works incredibly well  if you like rosemary the flavour is sweet at first then develops a gentle spiciness with a rosemary flavour that lingers after the chocolate has melted this is one of those chocolates that really shouldnt work quite as well as it does and im really happy to see something a little different make it through to a more mainstream chocolate brandoverall im impressed with the balance of quality and value of these vanini chocolate bars they arent craft chocolate but they are a step up in quality from supermarket chocolate and even the likes of lindttheyre not widely available in the uk yet but im sure they will be soon in the mean time you can pick them up for  euros a piece from the vanini websitethe rosemary inclusions sound wonderful i havent found any with rosemary here in the us  have you tried any chocolate with basil inclusions  i find that i tend to favor bars with basil inclusions as long as they dont include milk too that becomes too sweethappy tasting
they are nicely presented with colourful wrappers that illustrate what lies inside along with the humorous names theyve been given baroness proudly proclaim that they use a blend of premium couverture chocolate to make their bars which basically means that they buy good quality chocolate with plenty of cocoa butter in it to make it taste rich then mix stuff into it and all the stuff they mix in is homemade apart from nuts and fruit the chocolate they use is also certified organic and uses sustainably harvested beans and they also say that they use different blends of milk semisweet and dark for each of the bars they make although that wasnt always obvious subversive squirrel was my favourite of the seven bars it has some sizeable pieces of peanut brittle in the bar then for maximum peanutiness there are salted peanuts stuck on the back too it also helps that the chocolate is kept darker at least in baroness terms adding a richness to the proceedings this is definitely the one id come back to tantric tiger is dominated by the dried cranberries on the back so how you feel about the bar is going to be determined by your opinion of cranberries there are some almonds and a touch of sea salt which stops it from getting too sweet but the berries were just a bit too much for me love  blessing is the least exciting simply because theres nothing added to the milk and dark chocolate blend left by itself it is kinda dull mocha krunhjay suffers from a bit of an overload of flavours but in the best possible way it has some wonderful big chunks of crunchy sponge toffee mixed through the chocolate and the almond pieces which stud the back of the bar add some more texture the coffee promised on the wrapper is really mild though and just lurks in the background although im not sure thats actually a bad thing the problem with both dob dobs and aiyaaaa was that they took a beat of a beating thanks to canada post so by the time they reached me both had had their innards squished out of them both of them are filled bars  the former with caramel and pecans and the latter with butterscotch and almonds  but they were a bit of sticky mess when i opened them i still ate them though both were a touch sweet for me but since pecans always beat almonds dob dobs wins the day tummy rub is the other satisfyingly good bar with its combination of creamy milk chocolate and chocolate cookie pieces nothing too complicated at all but still like a lovely warm hug in bar form and that really sums up what baroness is doing here  this is really good comfort food the actual chocolate cant compete with the best from the bean to bar world but it really works in this context baroness have definitely found a niche for themselves and hopefully they will continue to experiment with new varieties in the future i would pretty much agree with your assessment of the baroness bars they are highly creative and a lot of fun but not to be thought of in the same sense as pure beantobar everyone i shared them with enjoyed them for what they are a sweet treat of pure fun like yours my filled bars arrived damaged so i suspect they should stick to only mailing the solid bars or changing the packaging to offer more protection
i met owner marc hambrook at the show and had a good chat but i still know relatively little about the business the website is very nice but doesnt go into a great deal of detail about the history of the business how the chocolates are made or where ingredients are sourced when i discover a chocolatier i like these are exactly the kinds of things i want to know more aboutthe chocolates themselves are elegant well made and very nicely presented the box i purchased at the show is a little bashed about entirely my own fault so there are a few loose bits stuck to the otherwise pristine chocolates my only real complaint here is that theres no menu so i had to use the website to work out which chocolate was which best i could in fact there was no information of any kind in the box including ingredients list im sure theyre coming though so im not too concerned update marc tells me menus are now included in every boxthere are some great chocolates in this box including some wonderfully smooth ganaches but the highlights for me were the caramels in particular the cobnut caramel the square chocolate with the ribbon design above i cheekily stole er asked nicely and sampled one of these on the opening night of the show and they really are fantastic im not a fan of nuts by any means but the rich toasted flavours combined with the deep muscovado caramel in this chocolate are to die for i could easily eat a whole box of these the black salt caramel is almost as good but at around half the size of a paul a young caramel i really wanted this one to be biggerthere are things that didnt work so well for me in the box too one of the chocolates  i think a mulberry gin truffle tasted amazing but was dusted in white icing sugar not the most appetising looking chocolate and the cause of most of the stray bits on the chocolates you see in my photos the same goes for the cherry  almond crumble wonderful flavours but the chocolate itself is coated in a crumble which doesnt look so good and tends to float around the boxthese are very minor issues though and in all honestly only an annoyingly finicky chocolate reviewer would even mention them the box is packed full of great chocolates with well balanced flavours and would make a fantastic gift for any chocolate lover highly recommendedyour favourite was mine too  that cobnut caramel could become a classic looking forward to what marc does next 
these brownies have a lot to live up to though i first heard about them well over a year ago when lauden owners sun and steven trigg told me they had made the most amazing brownies but lost the recipe since then they have been on a quest to recreate that mythical browniethe box contains four small brownies its an unusual format that works well for me each brownie is just enough to satisfy a chocolate craving without overindulging theyre great for sharing or simply for pacing yourself one little brownie makes the perfect afternoon pickmeupi loved laudens brownies but experience has shown brownies are a very personal thing and everyone seems to have a different idea of what makes a good oneone friend found them to be a little dry for his tastes but i cant help but think he might be comparing them to paul a youngs delicious lumps of moist gooeyness which arent strictly brownies at all if youre after something more traditional youd have to go a long way to beat this particular browniecomments are closed
that might not be entirely fair though because it might just be that it is completely overwhelmed by the little chunks of toffee which are definitely the star of the show or at least they are if you like your toffee a little bit on the burnt side which i do theres also a healthy dose of sea salt thrown in too and that makes periodic appearances as you munch awaysadly the pieces of nuts are rather small and dont really add much to the entire experience personally id have rather had a bit more nuttiness considering they get equal billing on the box and even if the pieces were big enough to add some crunch then id at least know they were there considering that this only costs a couple of dollars this is a perfectly acceptable bar of chocolate but that price tag should also bring some lowered expectations with it too the bar is definitely a little one note but thats ok if its a note that you enjoy it isnt enough to turn me into a trader joes convert but chances are ill seek one out next time im south of the bordercomments are closed
this year one of my favourite chocolate brands chocolat madagascar were exhibiting and had a full range of chocolate on show i loved everything they had on offer but there was one particular bar that really stood out this organic  baropen the wrapper and youre greeted by a most wonderful warming fruity aroma to me it smells like christmas whats more it looks like a work of art toothe flavour is unlike any bar ive tasted its full of raisins and molasses with the typical madagascan citrus notes almost lurking in the background im sure that part of the flavour comes from the organic sugar but it works perfectly with the natural fruity notes in the chocolate to produce a unique and wonderful baras it turns out its also great for pairing with drinks chocolatier paul wayne gregory chose this chocolate in a whisky  chocolate pairing we attended last week and it went down very well indeedif and when you do find it do make sure you go for the organic  bar rather than the  bar both are delicious but this is the one you really wanti looooved the madagascar  have you tried that one i actually think this one would be too sweet for methey dont have this one yet  nobody does because its currently on a boat from madagascar  note that the organic  is different from the regular wow what a great review of what sounds like great chocolate and for you to call it your favourite chocolate of the moment especially from you is really saying something truly amazed i did say of the moment because my favourite changes from moment to moment but this is really good
these days when i go shopping for chocolate i tend to look for the unusual i have a few reliable goto bars that i know will keep me happy but after that i prefer to search out something which ive never had before and my last big shopping trip offered me quite a few choices which fell into the unusual categorythe whole thing tastes just like a chocolatey banoffee pie with some nuts along for the ride and thats a very good thing indeedit is however incredibly rich and decadent to the point that one of the oversize squares was more than enough for me at one time but it is still the first banana chocolate which i can say that i genuinely enjoyed and id even go as far to say that id pick up another one consider me convertedoh my that caramelwow does sound as if they have chucked a whole lot of flavours into one bar how was the banana flavour as im a bit suspicious of banana flavours unless there is actual banana in it foodnerd xhttpwwwfoodnerdlifecomthe banana flavour is rather good and thats from someone who isnt the biggest fan they use natural flavourings according to the box and that seems to help it from being too overwhelming  you should definitely give it a try
founded by conservationist philipp kauffmann original beans puts conservation at the heart of everything they do in fact for every bar purchased the company plants a tree in the rainforest and both the outer wrapper in the foil inside are made from wood and are completely compostable by eating this chocolate you really are having a positive impact on the planetbut theres more to original beans than just ethics  their chocolate is reasonably priced and tastes great too kauffmann spends much of his time searching out rare and forgotten cacao and this papua kerafat bar is no exceptionnow if you judge a chocolate on name alone you might think this bar is made with beans from papua new guinea  a common choice for many beantobar chocolate makers but its actually made with beans from the indonesian province of papua on the western side of the island of new guineathat might seem like a small thing but new guinea is the second largest island in the world and consequently has a huge variety of cacao traditionally beans from papua new guinea are dried over fires giving them a smoky flavour but these indonesian beans have been dried more conventionally or at least more carefully revealing more of the true flavours of the cacaothose flavours as it turns out are really rather good open the foil wrapper and youre greeted by a wonderfully rich warm cocoa aromaas you can see my bar is a little battered having travelled from original beans hq in the netherlands to get to me but that hasnt affected the flavour at all it has a smooth buttery texture and an intense chocolatey flavour theres a hint of cocoa powder flavour and a touch of astringency to it but for me those just enhance the chocolatinessas it melts it reveals a gentle fruity acidity the tasting notes on the packet describe it as pear and dried fruit and im not going to argue with that its like a smooth buttery pear dipped in cocoa powder if you can imagine thatoriginal beans papua kerafat is currently only available through a very limited number of stores but thats purely because its no new i expect it to be widely available very soon and recommend trying someid love to try that one the shop near my office that used to sell original beans has subbed in another brand i think olive  sinclair  not the same
ive been lucky enough to try a slew of new british beantobar chocolates recently and ill be sharing some of my discoveries here over the next few weeksmichael has a passion for ethics and sustainability sourcing his beans directly from the farmers and transporting them with zero carbon footprint he tells me the beans are transported by sail ship into the local harbour at falmouth and then by horse drawn carriage to the factory up the road for a little added showmanship if thats true its something i would love to seethe packaging is both elegant and functional the bars are sealed inside paper bags and slipped into an attractive card pouch that can easily be resealed theres plenty of information on the label too i can tell you that this is batch c and the trinitario beans were conched for  hours its  cocoa solids  milk solids and contains just three ingredients cocoa beans raw cane sugar and whole milk powderthe moulding on the bar wasnt quite perfect on my bar but due to a courier who had clearly decided to play football with my parcel its not worth me showing it suffice to say even broken into a few pieces it was well tempered and looked goodthe tasting notes describe javan milk as rich and creamy milk chocolate with clotted cream notes and occasional hints of raisin and fudge but i got another flavour note and i got it big time coconut  in fact there is a coconutty aroma the moment you open the packet now i dont know if this is something to do with how the chocolate has been stored aged or something in the beans themselves but i happen to love coconut and i love this chocolateits very creamy you can almost taste fresh cream and has a very pleasant chocolatey flavour and that hint of fudge is certainly there too but coconut is the dominant flavour here and if thats your thing you really will love this barone of the joys of small batch chocolate is that i have no idea if this is deliberate or if the next batch will taste anything like this one where mass produced chocolate is specifically designed to maintain a uniform flavour with every batch chocolate like this changes and evolves with different harvests slight variations in the roast the conche and even how the chocolate is storedfor now though im very happy with this creamy coconutty milk chocolate if you love those flavours and youre looking to trade up to something a little better then i highly recommend giving this a goclotted cream raisin fudge sounds like cornwall im undecided on coconut notes in chocolate but certainly the fudge raisin and clotted cream would have pleased me

its the kind of organisation that has me in two minds one the one hand its a worker owned cooperative thats producing and promoting fairly traded products but on the other hand its a relatively big brand with a large range of products made in big factories i cant help thinking that the quality of some of the smaller chocolate makers who buy direct from farmers  producers isnt going to translate into a big umbrella brand like thisdespite the indepth story on the wrapper im still unclear where the cacao for this bar comes from there is a photo of a farmer from peru on the back and panama ecuador peru and the dominican republic are mentioned on the inside of the wrapper i assume that means this is some kind of blend of those origins which seems a shame given some of the fine flavour cacao thats grown in the individual countrieswhat i can tell you is that its a  cocoa solids dark chocolate so theres a fair amount of sugar along with candied ginger lemon oil and black pepperso how does it taste well almost exactly like youd expectthe sweetness of the chocolate and the flavour of the ginger hit you first followed swiftly by a nicely balanced lemon finally the heat from the ginger and black pepper hit you and stay with you long after the chocolate has gonewhile its interesting and the flavours do go together quite well the black pepper isnt really necessary here the ginger alone would have been enough for a pleasant lingering warmth as it is half an hour after trying the bar i still have the heat from the pepper in my mouth and im ready for it to go away nowi really wanted to like this chocolate but its just trying too hard for my tastes the wealth of information on the wrapper that doesnt explain simple things like where the chocolate comes from isnt compelling or exciting the flavours in chocolate had a similar effect on me theres too much going on with a lack of focuscomments are closed
you might be wondering how they get coconut into a flat bar like this theres not much to see on the front of the chocolate its a little scuffed understandable given the distance it has travelled to get into my greedy paws and divided into four large chunks but wheres the coconutyou have to turn the bar over to find itnow admittedly those eight little piles of beige flakes dont look like much but they do have plenty of flavour locked inside them of course youre not going to get that moist chewy bounty like experience from some toasted coconut flakes but you do get a decent amount flavourif youre anything like me when you place a small piece on your tongue and youll immediately be transported back to childhood memories of stuffing a bounty into your face and chewing forever but let it melt for a few seconds something wonderful happens those coconut flavours are engulfed and overwhelmed by the wonderfully citrus sweet and intense flavours naturally present in the madagascan cocoa its rare to find a chocolate that can hold its own against an added flavour and even rarer to find one where the chocolate tastes this goodtechnically the fruity acidity of the chocolate and creaminess of the coconut are probably not the best matched flavour combination in the world but i personally love it it evokes childhood memories and takes me on a flavour journey reminding me why i love the complexity of single origin chocolate and why i dont eat bounty any morei dont know how easy they are to get in the uk but if you like coconut in your chocolate i would recommend you check out fearless chocolate exploding coconutsi went to waitrose to get some of these before the offer ran out i have nibbled the coconut chocolate it wasnt very coconutty the chocolate was very strong and tangy i could only stand it in small doses but it was good i might try letting it melt and see if the flavours come out better i bought two other flavours  it cost me
these stores each with their own roaster winnower conch and tempering machine used to be known as roastconch but the company has rebranded its stores so often lately im not sure they even have a name now suffice to say you can buy the rabot  bars online and in just about any hotel chocolat shopthis particular bar was purchased in the brighton store where i was offered a piece to taste it was interesting enough that i ended up buying a whole bar to take homeif youre the kind of person who always wants to know more about their chocolate then you wont be disappointed with the wealth of information on this pack the front tells me its made with  harvest beans from the mekong delta  dong nai its roasted for  minutes at c and conched for  hours by senior chocolatier kiri kalenkoon the inside you can read the story of hotel chocolats rabot estate plantation in saint lucia as well as a little history of vietnamese cocoatheres also a tastometer chart that manages to plot the flavour profiles cocoa of different origins onto a single line it seems to be an attempt to say this bar is fruity but not as fruity as some madagascan origin bars as flavour profiles arent a one dimensional thing and i dont think its particularly helpful here but some may find it useful the tasting notes on the front describe it as a dragon with a taste for red fruit and it turns out thats a pretty good way to describe it initially it seems like it might bite your head off but give it a moment and the wonderfully sweet cherry and raspberry notes come to the front before the flavour finally transitions to something quite smooth and smoky its really rather goodthis is certainly not the kind of chocolate you eat in one go but a couple of pieces make a great afternoon pickmeup note that if you buy it online from the link below the product description refers to a  harvest version of this bar with slightly different tasting notes you may or may not get this more recent version when you buy yoursseriously love the packaging and its attempt to educate both expert and the casual chocolate lover have had some interesting eating from the rabot range  look forward to more of your reviewsi like vietnamese cocoa love the acidity ive only tried a marou bar just like madagascan cocoa how does it compare with the marou range which is truly excellent quality vietnamese chocolatei would say it compares very favourably to the similarly high cocoa solids  tien giang but given a choice i would still pick the marou  particularly the  tien giang or  ba ria
although at  a bar lillie belle farms chocolate isnt cheap that first taste was enough to have me wanting more and so on my most recent trip to selfridges i picked up this bar a  milk chocolate with a twistas you can see its a beautiful looking bar with its unique design and deep reddish brown colour its almost a shame to break off a chunk but when you do you are rewarded with a chocolate that tastes good as it looksthe fruitiness of the peruvian cocoa beans is evident and works exceptionally well with the milk  buttermilk combination i cant say i can taste any cheese which may or may not be a good thing depending on your point of viewits a rich and creamy flavour with a wonderful buttery malty note theres a hint of smokiness suggesting a fairly high roast  something im not usually keen on but its a flavour combination that i love in this chocolateif youre into rich and creamy milk chocolates then i recommend seeking this out i cant wait to try the rest of the lillie belle farms rangecomments are closed
technically though you could argue that pauls brownies arent brownies at all they contain so little flour that theyre more like a dense gooey block of ganache than a traditional brownie but frankly i dont care rules are there to be broken and i love that moist sticky gooeynessi was sent a tray  portions in each of both chocolate brownies and salted caramel brownies and theyre really rather good these are clearly proper brownies with a nice crisp top but what made them stand out for me is just how soft and gooey they are inside theyr deliciously moist and really very tasty light in texture but rich and intense in flavour these brownies are perhaps a little sweeter and not quite as chocolatey as a paul a young creation but theres no doubting that these little treats are most definitely proper brownies having tried a couple of slices of each for me its the salted caramel brownie that wins the day the extra flavour from the caramel really makes the differencethis is my first experience of galeta and im impressed with the product and service and it just  for a whole tray of chocolate brownies theyre pretty good value toofudgy centre crisp top beeeeeaaaaautifullooks amazing i have actually heard several good stories about the treats from galeta do they deliver outside the uk
by combining cocoa mass samples from origins around the world or noir can create a chocolate with practically any flavour profile its an exciting idea and a place i would love to visit but there is a part of me that thinks this is quite far away from the more natural process that modern beantobar artisans use when they create chocolateim used to makers that will search the world for the best beans treat them with care and coax the best possible flavours from a single origin but im sure there is a place for both approaches and i was interested to try the chocolate roux createdthe texture is smooth and slightly soft suggesting a high cocoa butter content and has an initial bitterness that slowly gives way to more of a cocoa powder flavour the fruitiness is very subtle but is there overall the flavour is pleasant but this is certainly not a bar of chocolate i would go out and buywith those strong cocoa notes i suspect it would make a great chocolate for baking or even a couverture for filled chocolates  providing the fillings had interesting flavours of their own indeed on the show roux cooked with the chocolate rather than simply eating it in bar formatwhile theres nothing wrong with it as a chocolate its just not very interesting what i cant say is if thats down to rouxs personal tastes or the or noir process and i think the only real way to know that would be to visit or noir and make my own chocolatedid you taste coconut i just remember michel mentioning the distinct coconut on the showhowever much callebauts sales reps sorryi belive they are called gourmet managers now or pr push this i still cannot believe its very artisan
a white chocolate sphere with a white chocolate and lemon filling the filling also seems to contain small pieces of pastry which give it an unusual texture and a slightly doughy flavour its a little odd but actually very nice  a little like licking cookie dough out of the bowla milk chocolate sphere rolled in toasted breadcrumbs with a centre of pure marmalade i was expecting some kind of marmalade ganache mixed with chocolate here so was somewhat surprised to have a mouthful of orange marmalade as the thin shell melted its very nice marmalade but its a little like eating a big spoonful straight out of the jar i cant help but think a nice dark chocolate  marmalade ganache would have worked better here both in terms of flavour and texturea dark chocolate sphere with a dark ganache made with stilton and a hint of port this one is a little unusual all the elements are there and can be tasted but its just a little too cheesy for me i have to confess im not a big stilton fan but equally i know people who would love this one of my favourite chocolatiers paul a young is known for a port  stilton chocolate and im not that keen on that one eithera simple milk chocolate cup with a bakewell flavoured filling this captures the flavour of an actual bakewell tart quite accurately but its a little sweet for my personal tastesa square chocolate with a gold finish and a raspberry caramel filling the filling here is actually more of a thin raspberry jam than a caramel theres a good raspberry flavour but again its a little sweet for me i would have preferred a richer caramel with a just hint of raspberry my favourite of the bunch a simple dark chocolate ganache with subtle flavour i probably wouldnt have been able to identify the flavour as gin  tonic had i not been told but its herbaceous and a little citrus and really quite enjoyable if i had one issue with it its that there was quite a bit of air between the filling and the shell that not only means that you get less but im sure will also have an impact on shelf lifeoverall then this is a pleasant little collection but it does lack some of the attention to detail of the higher end artisan chocolates ive tried over the years i didnt get much of a sense of the actual chocolate used daniel is primarily using belgian chocolate from callebaut which is a good staple for chocolatiers but often lacks more nuanced flavours that could be paired with the individual flavoursim sure that with a little tweaking and refinement to the flavours and production process they could be great then again that would probably have an impact on price  something which can have a huge impact for a small chocolatier at the moment theyre the kind of chocolates i would happily consume and share but theyre not quite at a level where i would buy them as a luxurious giftcomments are closed
i love the name and branding but i particularly like the box the thin card wrapper with has a simple paper sleeve to keep it closed and it feels like a quality product most importantly of all the design means i can reseal the pack after taking a chunk or two with a quality chocolate bar its really important to be able to wrap the bar up again because its not something you tend to eat in one go omnoms packaging means i can keep the bar with me and not have to worry about stray chunks and crumbs at the bottom of my bag its the little things that make for a great chocolate experiencetheres a slightly soft texture to the chocolate although im sure thats in no small part down to the current hot weather in london at the time of writing consequently the chocolate has a quick melt and releases its flavour rapidlythe fruity citrus notes are there in the flavour but theyre much more subtle than i was expecting from the aroma instead theres a prominent liquorice flavour note and some rather interesting floral flavours it doesnt kick you in the face like some madagascan chocolates but instead takes you on a more gentle and interesting ridethe friend who gave me this bar told me it was great but perhaps not as refined as it could be personally though i love it i love that its not the same as every other madagascan origin chocolate bar i love the flavour and i love the way its presentedi love to discover new chocolate bars and its so helpful to read detailed chocolate reviews like this one  now i have to try and find it in a store my personal favourite is   papua new guinea its crazy good but also different from any other pure chocolate i have ever had it claims to have taste notes such as  smoky tobacco burned oak and bourbon id say its more than notes the first taste blew me away it was a whisky smoky tobacco nutty explotion in my mouth the texture is soft as silk and leaves you with a long aftertaste of perfectly bitter kakao
ive had chocolate with popping candy before but theres a crazy amount in here  breaking the bar reveals that it is positively studded with the stuff as soon as the chocolate starts to melt the popping takes over at an alarming rate and the bar really lives up to the latter half of its name there were even a couple of occasions when i bit off a corner and the level of explosion i was greeted with made me jump just a little the bottom line is that this really is a fun bar of chocolate what it lacks in fieriness it makes up for with its all out attack on the interior of your mouth and it is pretty tasty too it also works as a great introduction for those trying to enter a more adventurous world of chocolate because it is very different but not in an intimidating way plus it is a lot of fun so there dom great review and your writing made me feel like trying some and the kids would love it too where can you get it in the uk merci davancei didnt write this michael our canadian writer did as far as i know its not available in the uk except onlinesorry for confusion dom we will have to importwhat  local shopthis does indeed sound like a fun bar of chocolate i love bars with popping candy every once in awhile and putting a touch of sea salt and chipotle would definitely take ones taste buds on a wild ridespookily i had some of this bar today i love it my friend brought it back from america for me i have to watch my sugar intake and carbs in general and this bar is perfect on that count and it has a reasonable volume of fibre in it too for a bar of chocolate it is pretty healthy as well as tasty and deserves to be more widely availablethink this is a fun chocolatebar 
based in oregon lillie belle was founded by jeff shepherd and named after his wife and daughter they started making truffles  years ago a lifetime ago in chocolate industry terms but only started producing their own chocolate from the bean last yeari picked up this  madagascar bar from selfridges in london the packaging is distinctive and unique but not entirely my cup of tea theres certainly no mistaking the maker but when im paying  for a bar i want unwrapping it to be part of the pleasure it doesnt quite feel like a high value product when presented in an environment like selfridges where it is displayed next to some beautifully packaged bars and thats a shame because this bar is really rather interestingwith hundreds of bars in front of me to choose from what drew me to this one was the fact that it has been made with two different bean roasts cocoa beans are almost always roasted as part of the chocolate making process and the time and temperature of that roast has a significant effect on the flavour of the finished chocolate roast them too long and the chocolate will have a burnt flavour not enough and the real chocolate flavours wont develop at allthe idea of using two different roasts is that the finished chocolate will take you on a journey in theory it should add an extra layer of complexity to the flavour bringing out a full range of flavours within the bean but it also adds complexity to the chocolate making process and if the roasts arent timed extremely carefully it could easily go wrong so did lillie belle farms get it right well  almostive tasted several bars made with madagascan cocoa that have a similar high roast recently and this is by no means the most roasted its actually a pleasant flavour but it does tend to hide rather than accentuate the natural flavour of the bean roast time is a very difficult thing to get right and not something you can change after the fact its also quite a personal thing so you could equally put it down to me having slightly different tastes to the chocolate makerthat said this is still a great bar and ill be picking up some more from lillie belle they also produce a  milk chocolate with blue cheese which i think i have to trydear domthank you for the review i understand your hesitancy about my packaging i really do you see i despise the norm i go out of my way to make my products and packaging reflect my personality there is no marketing team focus groups or hired help to brand our products there is only me an over weight cacao pod tattooed chocoholic with no social filter i make excellent products with an honesty and focus so incredibly personal that i am thrilled to be finding chocolate fans world wide who appreciate my art i agree with you chocolate making is hard and attempting to combine two roasts took huge nerve  but this is as are all of my creations that wind up on store shelves a personal and very subjective taste that appeal to me in a way that says lets share this madagascar beans tend to very acidic and having tasted dozens and dozens of others i set out to make something a touch different than the rest as for the labelswhat can i say i saw the grateful dead hundreds of times i am what many used call a hippie and unashamedly so  if we ever met it would all make sense and you would get the joke instantly thanks for the reviewpeace and chocolatejeffhow great that the maker comments on the review well done jeff i like the packaging and id love to try the bar i wonder if they sell it in manchesteri also think its wonderful that the chocolate maker comments on reviews and in an honest objective way keep going jeff and hope to try a bar soon
all robins cakes have a distinctive look and feel to them they are beautifully and expertly crafted but always have a handmade sugarcraft finish to them if youre after fine patisserie then these creations may not be for you but if you want a cake that truly looks as though its been made with love by a real person then theyre a wonderful choicei have to say i love my cake it tastes great and nothing really beats the thrill of having something made especially for you delivered to your door whether it be something special for a corporate event of a character birthday cake for a child i can thoroughly recommend robins amazing creationscomments are closed
of course selfridges have the overheads of running a very large physical department store to take into account and i am regularly arguing that we should all be paying more for our chocolate in this case the discrepancy is a little uncomfortable for me thoughbut back to the chocolate itself these small dried berries really pack a fruity punch that i think will appeal to anyone who loves fruity chocolate the intensely citrus flavour is rounded off perfectly by the smooth  dark chocolate but theyre just a bit too sharp to prevent you from eating the whole lot in one goi found that although the box looked small g was enough to last me at least a couple of days  the same amount of time a good quality dark chocolate bar would last theyre perfect for carrying around in your bag for a quick pickmeup and unlike most chocolate bars the box is easy to close and keep the contents firmly inside rather than rattling around your bagthoroughly recommended  but i would love to see them more widely availablecomments are closed
tesco might not be the first place you turn when youre on the hunt for fine chocolate  it certainly isnt for me  but as tastes change more and more were seeing supermarkets jump on the single origin own label bandwagonits something i have mixed feelings about while its great that were all becoming aware of better quality chocolate own brand single origin bars are often difficult to trace and made with lower quality cocoa in order to keep prices downso how does this little  bar made with madagascan beans stack upthat aside its a nice enough looking bar with a nice simple ingredients list to boot cocoa mass sugar cocoa butter vanilla extract the one thing that tends to mark this kind of single origin own brand chocolate apart is that very rarely will you find nasties like added vegetable fatsthe flavour notes on the wrapper describe it as predominantly rich cocoa throughout with notes of fresh fruit and a hint of honey those notes may be a little vague but they are quite accurate its unusual for a madagascan bar in that you dont get the normal blast of citrus flavour notes from it instead its more subtle rounded and gentleon face value id recommend giving it a go but there is one little fly in the ointment the pricealthough i cant find this particular bar on the tesco website the other bars in the range are retailing at  for a g bar at that price i have to wonder where the money is going if the farmers are getting a fair deal if its being made in a huge automated factory and to what extent expert chocolatiers were involved in the processi was thinking of trying tescos origin range but that was before seeing they add vanilla now im not too sure but your description of the flavour makes it sound like an easy chocolate to eatgot a trialsized bar of this on the go at the moment  and youre bang on have you tried the nonfinest ownbrand  ivory coast  ecuador bar tastewise at least im a fan
when cioccolato tavoletta said they were sending me a few samples from italy i wasnt expecting the giant crate that arrived at my door containing a small bag of everything from the tavoletta rangeas it turns out the sheer volume of chocolate they sent it as difficult to photograph as it is to consume so in order to make my life a little easier i decanted a couple of each chocolate onto a platethere much betterstill theres rather a lot to get through so rather than writing about them all im just going to pick out a few of my personal highlightsthese simple milk or dark chocolate bars are filled with gianduja chocolate combined with hazelnut paste while the dark chocolate version is nice the shell is a little bitter but the milk chocolate version is deliciously creamy and nuttyone of the more unusual and interesting chocolates in the collection a white chocolate ganache made with cream thats been infused with parmesan although the texture is a little grainy it kind of works theres a definite hint of parmesan to it and its not too sweet for a white chocolate eitherthe website describes this as a diamond shaped praline in dark chocolate encasing a creamy crunchy fruity salty and spice infused filling but doesnt actually go into specifics about what the fruity  spicy flavours are tasting it theyre quite subtle but work very nicely i dont know what it is but i kinda like itanother chocolate that comes in both milk and dark chocolate versions a three pronged chocolate where each prong contains a while roasted piedmont hazelnut as with previous chocolates i think the milk version works a little better but either way these simple chocolates are quite moreishi love fruity chocolates and the flavour of this dark chocolate with quince apple jelly did was great it was a little let down by a very thick chocolate base that made it quite difficult to eat but it was still a favourite for memuch of this range are quite traditional pralines which are fine but theyre just not my thing for me theres only so many ways you can combine nuts and chocolate before it starts to get a little repetitive for the most part though i did enjoy this selection in terms of quality theyre above average but unfortunately not outstanding thats partly down to european tastes which are more conservative than some of the top london chocolatiers that im used to but id still love to see a few more imaginative flavours most importantly at all id like to see higher quality chocolate used  particularly in the dark chocolatesi like the sound of the parmigiano and the walnut one
luck for us vivanis way of rectifying this situation was to send us a big box of new bars to write aboutso without further ado heres some of the highlights of the selection they sent us starting with two single origin barsits not often you find single origin milk chocolates at vivanis pricepoint under  per g bar so i was intrigued to try it unusually its made with coconut blossom sugar rather than cane sugar along with both milk and cream powderit has a soft texture and a flavour thats chocolatey if perhaps a little too roasted its not particularly complex and the flavour of the cream is also quite prominent as a result it wasnt really my cup of teaanother bar sweetened with coconut blossom sugar this time though theres only three ingredients cocoa mass and cocoa butter being the other two one things clear from the start with this bar  theres quite a lot of cooca butter in it the flavour is intense but ultimately very approachable of really quite tasty as with the milk chocolate bar its not particularly complex but there is a hint of fruit in the background its a much better bar than the milk and one i found very enjoyableas with the  bar its quite high in cocoa butter meaning its not overly intense but neither is it too sweet all in all another very enjoyable barthe rest of the vivani bars have a slightly chunkier format and more sugar this one comes in at  cocoa solids and the thick chunks are filled with a gooey sticky marzipanlike substance thats much closer to the german confectionery version of marzipan than anything ive experienced elsewhere its too sweet and too soft for me but those with a very sweet tooth might like it and germansaccording to the wrapper this chocolate is made with organic rice drink powder that might seem a little odd but it really translates as rice milk chocolate  a milk chocolate made without dairy thats important because it means that it can be enjoyed by the millions of people who for whatever reason cant have dairythe flavour is quite pleasant and theres certainly a hint of cereal in there i dont know that i would eat it regularly but as a milk chocolate substitute i found it more than acceptablefinally we have a range of smaller format g barsthis  dark chocolate with small pieces of black cherry is quite addictive so its probably good it comes in a small format the chocolate dark chocolate is relatively sweet but works very well with the sour cherries that cut through the sweetness just enougha  milk chocolate with creamy caramel filling im not much of fan of long shelf life caramels as they tend to be full of preservatives and i have to say this wasnt my thing the milk chocolate is sweet but the filling is insanely sweet and buttery probably my least favourite of the whole selectionthe description on the wrapper  dark milk chocolate with a crispy espresso cream filling  sums this up quite well although at  cocoa solids its not particularly dark its still too sweet for my personal taste but the combination of coffee and biscuity crunch do work quite well togetherfinally we have another bar featuring the rice milk chocolate  this time with small pieces of granulated orange the result is a flavour similar to but perhaps a little better than a terrys chocolate orange  but importantly in a chocolate thats suitable for those who cant have dairy again not really my thing but i know plenty of people who would like it simply because its one of the few milk chocolates they can eatall in all vivani have a good selection of bars especially considering the price point i would put them in the same kind of category as lindt but actually rate the chocolate a little higher the  bar is particularly approachable and if you have any kind of dairy allergy the rice milk chocolates are worth seeking out toohmmmupon first seeing the picture of the  cocoa milk bar i thought it was something id love to try given my weakness for high cocoa milk bars something ill always blame on a couple of zotter labooko wonders now im starting to think otherwise not just because of the review but also because of my previous experiences with vivani chocolatesif i am to look back i dont think there was ever a vivani bar that i really enjoyed and wasnt a dark chocolate one and its not like i dont have a sweet toothi sometimes try somewhat similar bars in parallel i did that with vivanis superior ecuador bars both the milk  cocoa one and the dark  cocoa one  i preferred the dark one also with one of the milk chocolate felix bar and the plain dark creamy bar  i found the dark one to be way betterso i guess the next vivani bar ill try is going to be the dark cranberry one which ive had for quite a while but there was always something more interesting to try until now ill also be looking for the dark cherry one though the range imported here is pretty limitedps  i think lindt still ranks higher for me their range is absolutely huge and despite having tried so many of their products for the past ten years every once in a while i still find something new i really enjoy  like the boozy truffles earlier this yeari think you should definitely try the cranberry one i also liked the cherry one but the milks were all a bit too sweet for me having said that my flatmate  who has a sweeter tooth than me and is also lactose intolerant  loved the rice milk and the little bit of the  milk she tried its all very personalim not jealous im not jealous  im not jealous  really not jealous   okay so i am  i would give anything to try that  dominican milk chocolate with coconut sugar  and that  sounds appealing too  thanks for the info  will have to add these to my chocolate to try listthat sounds delicious i wish i could taste and try them all
in this case the filling is made into a smooth ganache thats really rather tasty its made with orange concentrate apple balsamic vinegar and grappa and has a good balance of chocolate orange and acidity from the vinegar the entire bar is wrapped in a thin layer of zotters  beantobar mountain milk chocolate its very nice but with such a thin layer it doesnt bring a lot to the party as with most of the hand scooped range this is all about the fillingi found this bar all to easy to eat the texture is light enough that its almost like eating a piece of chocolate cake rather than a chocolate bar and consequently it disappeared a little too quicklyof course there are many people who simply dont like the combination of chocolate and orange  or have had their tastebuds forever tainted by the terrys chocolate orange personally i liked this a lot its obviously not the most refined chocolate experience but in terms of quality and flavour its a huge step up from your average confectionery chocolate bari am one of those many people who do not like orange and chocolate together but your pictures make this chocolate look so good and the orange colour on the packaging makes it look so citrusyi agree  its amazing how much the packaging can influence you isnt itlooks delicious need to try make one of those 
as you might imagine i get offered all kinds of chocolate related products for review here but with limited time i have to turn many offers that dont fit into the usual bars or truffles categories down this one however caught my attentionthe very next day i was informed that yoosli was amazing addictive and awesome but not as a healthy breakfast  as a late night snack eaten straight out of the boxit quickly became clear that i was going to have to do things properlyit turns out that when consumed with a little milk andor natural yoghurt theyre equally good the clusters have a great crunch and a nice balance between the chocolate and berry flavours most importantly of all grown up cocoa pops lovers will be glad to know they even turn the milk chocolateyi have to confess im not normally a breakfast person its been quite a while since ive had any breakfast cereal at least any that doesnt come in a handy bar format but ive been rather taken with my yoosli my g box is now almost gone and im starting to regret giving the other two boxes awayif i have one reservation its that a quick glance at the ingredients does reveal non hydrogenated palm oil fairly high up on the list im sure its necessary for holding the clusters together or something but its something i would rather not be consumingbut that really is the only downside i can find to what a very tasty breakfast cereal  and late night snackthis seems so yum yummy i wanna taste this tooit just had to have a disgusting and unethical ingredient somewhere ill stick to my porridge
the thing i noticed when buying these is that theres quite a lot of crossover between the flavours here and zotters hand scooped and mitzi blue ranges for many of the chocolates in this range what youre getting is mini versions of the bigger barsi had thought i was being quite restrained only buying  but thats too many to write about individually so instead i just want to talk about some of the highlights in my own box its a box that i picked out from my own personal preferences so its perfectly possible ive missed out on something amazing next time ill just have to buy a bigger boxa soft and creamy white chocolate ganache covered in a thin layer of white chocolate as ganaches go this is quite thick but its very smooth and has a wonderful citrus burst with a gentle alcoholic kicka dark chocolate truffle ball with an intensely zingy blackcurrant flavour if you love fruit flavour chocolates as much as i do this one will really hit the spota simple delicious hazelnut nougat square decorated with blue flowers  similar to zotters mitsy blue range i love the nougat but i did find the flowers stuck in my teeth a littlea caramel nougat in a very thin layer of caramel white chocolate this replicates one of zotters hand scooped bars but actually works better in this smaller format its sweet with a pleasant crunch and a very nice biscuity caramel flavoura double layered square chocolate with a layer of soft marzipan sat on top of a cherry jelly i loved the contrast in textures in this chocolate the cherry layer has an unusual chewy foamy texture and the marzipan practically melts in the mouthoverall its an interesting and unique approach to truffles and pralines that im very glad to have sampled personally i still prefer the bars particularly the solid single origin labooko range but these still make a great gift  and something a little different from your average box of chocolatei still have petals in my teeth thoughthe ones w flowers are beautiful  did the flowers impart any tastepersonally i still prefer the bars particularly the solid single origin labooko rangei feel the same way the crazy flavour combinations are always incredibly tempting to me theyre really well done and i enjoy them but if i had to pick a favourite range id definitely go for the plain single origin labooko because the chocolate gets to be in the spotlight there and its really good chocolate
the chocolate itself looks typically pretty  nice and shiny with an interesting series of lines that guarantees that only strangelyshaped pieces can be snapped off when it comes to flavour though i was a little underwhelmed that isnt to say that this isnt a decent bar of chocolate but it lacks the specialness i was hoping forit starts off promisingly enough with plenty of smooth robust chocolate notes but just as it begins to build up some momentum it stops some of that is down to the added vanilla which is always there without being too obvious but theres a distinct lack of complexity from the beans there might be the slightest suggestion of citrus and berries as it lingers but it just isnt enough to elevate this from being surprisingly onedimensionalmaybe they are still finding their feet when it comes to this particular location but considering that this is a valrhona bar i was expecting more im not willing to give up on loma sotavento yet though and ill be back to see what the  vintage has to offer howd i end up here on the internet  i thought i was turning a corner to the end of the tubes but find a wonderful blog on chocolate   what caught my eye on this entry was the shape of the pieces that make up the bar   the distinct shapes look so much like they would fit better in the mouth with the wide end towards the back of the throat better than a standard rectangle   anyways what a delight to find your blog i shall have to check in when the urge for chocolate strikes  for for today  im a boring person that until now thought chocolate was just chocolate   thank you for changing my mindmaybe they are still finding their feet when it comes to this particular location  theres always something a connoisseur of chocolate in writing will say that makes me think and just smile and that was the quote from this write up oh and in the summer i shall be travelling the south of framce and plan on buying valrhona any you highly regard and could suggesthiis valrhona selling pure cocoa chocolate bar
in my head i expected every single convenience store that i visited in tokyo to have shelf upon shelf of kit kats but that really isnt the case usually you can find the standard milk chocolate variety and also green tea but nothing terribly exotic  that takes a bit more workthere is a special kit kat store the chocolatory which opened at the beginning of  apparently it has some unique flavours only on sale at that one location but i didnt have enough time to search it out instead i relied on the souvenir stores which had a decent enough selection of more unusual varieties for curious tourists to purchase by the time i was done i had accrued seven different flavours strawberry cheesecake rum raisin sakura matcha beniimo hojicha roasted tea wasabi and hot japanese chili heres my thoughtsstrawberry cheesecake like almost all of these is covered in flavoured white chocolate with some extra sandwiched between the wafers to make sure theres no doubt what variety is being consumed and this is definitely strawberry thats about all really pleasant enoughrum raisin is a bit more interesting just because it takes me back to my childhood and being given tastes of my dads rum and raisin ice cream and being told that i could possibly get drunk as a result i didnt and i didnt here either but it tastes goodthe japanese love cherry blossoms  the sakura  and who can blame them because when spring arrives the country is absolutely covered in them so it isnt a surprise that theres a celebratory kit kat which mixes together green tea with a hint of cherry its fine if you like green tea because thats the dominant flavour here im not a huge fanbeniimo is a japanese purple sweet potato and it definitely wins the prize for being the prettiest kit kat here it has more than a touch of fruitiness to it and most people would find it hard to identify it as being sweet potato more interesting than tastyhojicha roasted tea is the most surprising in the bunch because it completely lacks subtlety it tastes of the strongest cup of tea youve ever had in your life with another layer of flavour because of the roasted element and better still the filling in the wafers gives just a touch of creaminess which adds the right amount of smoothness surprisingly goodwasabi kit kats are just plain weird theres absolutely no mistaking the familiar scent of wasabi once the foil wrapper was opened but the taste is where the real weirdness begins because it changes from sweet to savoury again and again theres no real heat but theres still lots of wasabi flavour it really has to be tasted to be believed but it isnt something i need to ever eat again everthe king of the japanese kit kats however is hot japanese chili first of all it is the only one here which is covered in dark chocolate making it more like your usual run of the mill kit kat but hidden within is some rather spicy hotness that makes it all worthwhile it takes a while to really get going but when it does it gets surprisingly fierce and sticks around at the back of your throat for a while if only all kit kats were this deliciousso very cool who would ever think there would be an entire store devoted to exotic kitkat flavours the dark chocolate hot japanese chili definitely sounds like one that i would enjoy thx for telling us about the chocolatory will have to get me there at some point in time
im very happy that the people at vivani didnt go with any of those dubious health claims for their vollmilch waldbeer crunchy bar after all just adding some granola to a bar of chocolate isnt going to turn it into some kind of superfood but thats basically what this is   organic milk chocolate with wild berry granola mixed through it  leaves a lot of room for the raw cane sugar the first item on the ingredient list and that translates into a rather sweet bar of chocolate those who like theirs dark and rich should stay awayim not quite sure why i was surprised that this tasted so much of granola but i was the little clusters of oat flakes really dominate with the blueberries and raspberries charging to the front of the pack too but what i wasnt ready for was the texture adding all that stuff to the chocolate makes for a very cluttered bar plus it goes beyond the crunchy thats promised on the box by the end of each square theres a grittiness left behind just like when eating a big bowl of granola and i really really didnt like that at all thats a shame really because the chocolate itself looks so good i wonder if i could find vivani in the ukit does look good doesnt it  you can certainly find it in the uk  its available on amazon and somewhere like whole foods may have it
first up is a box of four goose eggs  three of which are made from hotel chocolats high cacao white chocolate one flavoured with strawberry and the fourth is made from their caramel chocolate which seems to be getting into a lot of this years easter eggsnot being the greatest fan of either white chocolate or strawberry i confess i had a few problems getting into these but as ever i had a selection of brave volunteers who were willing to endure a few mouthfuls on my behalf and while a hardened dark chocolate fan like myself might not go for these they dont fail to deliver what they promise if youre going to eat white chocolate you may as well go for something proper and these eggs do have a lot of flavour as well as the inevitable sweetness the caramel chocolate egg has that added richness to it but the size of the eggs means that youre never going to overindulgethe eggs themselves are very pretty the scattering of vanilla seeds on the surface of the eggs gives them an interesting look and this seasons choice of pastel shades works really well with the colour scheme of the packagingfinally we have something a little more lighthearted  a splat egg hotel chocolat would like us to believe that theres been an eggsplosion in their factory and as you can see this means that an otherwise plain caramel milk chocolate egg has been hit with a large blob of pale yellow vanilla white chocolate whats surprising here is that the white chocolate has  more cacao than the caramel milk chocolatenow im not sure a hollow egg is the best idea for a main egg i remember being quite disappointed by hollow eggs as a child but i was always a bit of a greedy guts but if you sit these alongside most companies hollow egg offerings the  hotel chocolat range knocks spots or should that be splats off the opposition for a start theyre very attractive the choice of pastel colours has a brand new retro feel and the quality of the chocolate is still way above most of what youll find on supermarket shelves so if youre contemplating an easter egg hunt of your own this week why not pop into one of hotel chocolats numerous high street stores and have a look at these for yourselfalternatively theres still time to pick up a last minute gift online link below with last orders at pm on april thcomments are closed
contained within an old fashioned style egg box are  mini eggs each filled with flavoured caramelthere are three flavours in all kalamansi lime passion fruit  rosemary and mandarin  tonka beanrococos head chocolatier barry johnson has become known for these zingy flavoured caramels since taking on the role a couple of years ago theyre a firm favourite of mine both for their flavour and texture i particularly love the kalamansi but they are all fantasticthe kalamansi caramel is deliciously citrus while the mandarin  tonka is more subtle but with a gentle warmin effect from the tonka bean the passing fruit  rosemary falls somewhere between the two with a gentle fruitiness with a twist of a hint of rosemarybut perhaps one of the best things about this little box is that each egg is actually two distinct chocolates that means that this little box actually contains  top quality chocolates  its not just a quality alternative to a traditional easter egg but its one of those rare easter chocolates where you actually get more than you might think inside the box might seem expensive for what is quite a small box but this is really one of those cases where youre paying for quality chocolate rather than packaging they make an understated easter gift thats packed with flavour  something much more special than a simple hollow eggcomments are closed
this is one of those  bars that really tastes like a  bar the tasting notes say that its bark is worse than its bite but im not convinced that is the case it is very bold aggressive and hard to do anything with except nibble tentatively rather than the promised antique oak i get lots of harsh whisky notes that are not very pleasant their other lower percentage saint lucian bars are much better and i cant help but think some sugar would mellow this right out having had bars made from conacado beans before this was a bit of a surprise because this was a lot more robust than i was expecting again theres some whisky with big coffee notes thrown in  it starts strong and stays strong with just a few fruitier hints right at the end not bad at all but still one best enjoyed in small doses this is the pick of the trio because it doesnt possess any of those overly hard edges that the other two did the chocolate has a smooth earthiness that slowly gives way to a red wine richness that lingers for quite a while leaving behind a wonderfully rich chocolaty taste it is surprisingly moreish for a  bar and well worth seeking out so the world of  chocolate is still a mixed bag which isnt for the meek but it does pay dividends if you are willing to take the plungewhen are you going to try duffys  his is from peru toono comparison duffys is in a totally different classyoure making me hungry and everyone knows here that chocolate and whisky make a perfect combo i max out at  percent cant get anywhere near a  percent for now i appreciate the experience shared though however after  glasses of whisky who knows if i was completely sober youd have to tie me to a tree im just saying
the wonderful thing is that theyve managed to come up with a set of destinations and chocolates that fulfil both criteria and theyre really rather good they arefrom the descriptions alone you can tell how much work has gone into this collection but as is often the case with paul a youngs chocolates the flavours themselves are surprising delightful and deliciousi love all these chocolates both for the flavour combinations and the meanings behind the chocolates stand outs for me are the london gin  tonic chocolate the new york which really does taste like a cheesecake and venice with its creamy texture and subtle limoncello flavouras if creating a unique collection of chocolates wasnt enough you can also buy this pink praline brownie im fairly certain the inspiration for this came from chocolate maker pralus famous praluline  a brioche loaf stuffed with sweet pink praline pieces the pralus brioche is one of my favourite foods in the world and theyve been replicated faithfully in this brownieif i have a problem with it its simply that there arent enough praline pieces and its difficult to see them so they dont have quite the visual impact the brioche has thats a minor issue though and like most paul a young brownies this one is delicious and the praline adds both texture and flavour to the mixfinally for those who like the traditional there are solid milk and dark chocolate hearts decorated with gold and silver leaf theyre very pretty but if youre thinking of buying me a valentines gift id much rather have the destinations box of chocolates  pleasesounds wonderfullove dark chocolate
the box is divided into two layers the first layer contains zchocolats signature chocolate range fifteen numbered chocolates these chocolates  a range of pralines and ganaches form zchocolats core range and are made with a mix of venezuelan and ivory coast origin chocolate the second layer consists of  chocolate hearts theres a dark chocolate ganache in a white chocolate shell a milk chocolate hazelnut praline a dark chocolate with vanilla caramel and a redpainted white chocolate heart with bergamot ganacheall the chocolates in this collection are well made and tasty but the thing you really need to know is the price these  chocolates will set you back a cool  if youre judging it on the chocolate alone thats over  per chocolate and for that money you really could find better quality chocolates elsewherebut that kind of misses the point these arent chocolates you buy to eat yourself you buy them to give as a spectacular valentines gift when you want to make a real impression with someone you love you could almost say that the chocolates themselves are secondary to the packaging a visually stunning collection and a box theyll want to keep foreverin fact with all the optional extras available everything from wrapping engraving and even a concierge service you could take the cost of this box to well over  theres no doubt its a spectacular gift but overdo it and it might start to look like you have more money than taste that said if you can afford them zchocolats boxes do make a great gift youre not getting the best chocolate in the world but theyre tasty enough and the presentation is truly wonderfuli do not recommend using them one word of advice when shipping luxury goods internationally  make sure the vendor has an established partnership with a shipping vendor and is not someone who casually calculates delivery time like zchocolates does you can take my advice or give your delivery one month variation to get the goods which in case of perishables you might not get the best product or even worse you might ship a valentines day gift in marchi ordered chocolates for a family event paid more than other competitors are charging on the promise my order will be there on time with one week of time ahead of the event and paying extra for the delivery to get to the destination at the given date i relied on zchocolates to be able to manage their logistics they failed big time and not only have they missed their promissed delivery date by more than two days they never assumed responsibility for their failure to manage their logistics every email i received from them blames everyone but their failure to manage their shipment and estimate their logisticsto make things worse they dont mention that customs fees are not calculated in their quote when you are charged so your gift recipient has to pay extra money when she receives the giftone thing i should have done and i did not is google the phrase zchocolat reviews to see the vendor has dropped the ball before the same way and they have not improvedps this post has  been deleted from this blog twice already it tells me the blog is not neutral in its reviews and the review is an advertisement please share this post if you see it i typically do not leave negative comments but it seems like a lot of valentine days will be ruined if people order from zchocolat and the company fails in their service like they did with medear ilijawe would have been more than pleased to refund the customs fee since you had not been informed about this however since we could not reach your gift recipients and the occasion had passed we agreed to have your order refunded and the package was subsequently returned to our offices i understand that this was a terrible experience for you and i would like to extend all my apologies for the distress and prejudice it caused warmest regardsjulia from zchocolat
in addition to replenishing my stash of their wonderful dark fire chocolate i was getting a little twitchy not having some in the house for emergencies she also got me one of their special chocolate twigs that they make just for the festive season this year they had coconut caramel with maldon salt mudslide with kahlua baileys and whisky and pineapple ginger which is the one i was giventhe twig came very well disguised in a cardboard mailing tube making it hard to know just what was hiding within whilst the name conjures up mental images of slim slightly irregular chocolate fingers that wasnt the case when i opened up the tube  these really arent very twiglike at all instead there was a single chunky bar of chocolate between six or seven inches in length and an inch wide more a plank than a twig but thats just splitting hairs or logstheres a lot to take in from the outside with this particular variety one side is very knobbly thanks to a layer of souffletine  those small crisp cereal balls  which adds plenty of crunch to the bar but the real stars here are those advertised on the outside the pineapple and the ginger because they are the things that dominate the proceedingsthe chocolate is nice and dark  no percentage stated but im thinking about   but it isnt one of somas big bold chocolates because it is happy enough to hold back and let the added stuff do the heavy lifting ginger is the most obvious flavour with its distinctive tingle and then after a bit of chewing theres the sweetness of pineapple sharing the spotlight it is a great combination that i wouldnt necessarily associate with christmas as it made me think more of sunnier tropical climes which isnt a bad thing to be thinking about during a canadian winter it is definitely the kind of bar which needs to be nibbled rather than eaten in one sitting because it is a little on the sweet side plus the dimensions of the twig make it easier to cut chunks off with a knife rather that bite at it might even be designed to be shared but sharing somas chocolate isnt always the first thing that comes to my mind at leastthis sounds amaaazing
brewed cocoa seems to be a bit of a thing right now the idea is simple make a cocoa drink in the same way youd usually make coffee so rather than use chocolate or cocoa powder you simply let cocoa nibs and sometimes shells infuse in hot waterthe crio br were kind enough to send me four different varieties to try along with a french press to make them in simply put a couple of tablespoonfuls into the press add hot water stir and leave to steep before servingcrio br recommends steeping for  minutes but in practice i found that a little too long having had brewed cocoa drinks in the past the thing i noticed immediately about crio br was just how finely ground the beans are this is really important as a finer grind means a higher surface area and a quicker fuller brew i prefer a lighter cocoa drink so for my tastes  minutes was enoughthe other thing that comes through right away is that the beans are roasted quite heavily im sure thats a deliberate attempt to appeal to coffee drinkers who like that fuller roasted flavour but i would have preferred something a little more gentle that said each variety had its own characteristics and flavouri added a spoonful of sugar to each cup which i suggest doing just to take the bitter edge off the drinkthis one has the most interesting and complex flavours but also the highest roast there are some great fruity notes in this venezuelan cacao but the high roast means it just tastes burnt to me id love a lighter roast version of this onea less complex cacao but the slightly lower roast makes this my favourite of the group id still prefer a slightly lower roast but this one makes a really quite pleasant pickmeupsimple chocolatey flavours with a slightly bitter roasted edge that a little sugar helps to even out quite coffeelike in flavoura higher roast version of the ivory coast drink for me the most interesting aspect of this one is just how much like a roasted coffee it tastes all in all i love the idea of crio br but id like to see some varieties with milder roasts before id buy it myself i could add more sugar or a little milk to my drinks but personally i love the natural flavours in cacao and id rather not cover them upif youre into coffee with a strongly roasted flavour and want to try something a bit different youll almost certainly love them though brewed cocoa is definitely the futurei never knew you can brew cocoa nibs i sometimes get those from my veganraw foodist friends and sometimes i dont know what to do with them so i end up with a lot of leftovers i want to try this im not really a coffee drinker and our coffeemaker at home is just gathering dust well thanks to this post i know have an idea
these days it seems that no matter where you go there is someone making beantobar chocolate and that is a wonderful thing so when i was recently down in north carolina for a conference i just happened to stumble upon some local bean to bar chocolate without even tryingit is a single origin bar with the carenero beans coming from just east of caracus  they might not be the most beloved beans from venezuela but they still have some of the same fruity notes the chocolate itself has a tiny bit of grittiness to it  something which i actually like and feel is a good match for rustic flavour of the goat milk ultimately it all comes down to how you feel about the goat milk here if you can take the goatiness because it is the star of the show then this is a creamy delightful bar of chocolate but i can understand how some people might be a little underwhelmed by a dark milk bar where dairy dominates over cacaocomments are closed
sometimes though its an awful lot of trouble to go to particularly when im just in the mood for something comforting i dont want to spend half an hour in the kitchen when i get home on a freezing december evening i just want a big mug of hot chocolate and if i have to wait longer than two minutes i start to get really quite grumpythe lovely people at g sent me all three flavours to try regular hot chocolate salted caramel and mocha flavours and they really are quick simple and satisfyingg recommend pouring heating the drinks in a jug in the microwave then transferring to your favourite mug so thats what i did for my first test doing it in a jug let me give the drink a quick whisk before serving but i found that even this added valuable seconds to the preparation time so when it came to trying the other two flavours i just heated them directly in the mugthe verdict i like them theyre made with whole milk and have a nice creamy texture its not too thick and importantly not too sweet i enjoyed all the flavours but the salted caramel was the winner for me and i suspect that will end up being the best seller the flavour balance is spot on and i quickly found myself going back for morethe downside of having hot chocolate in cartons is that you could very quickly find it takes up all the space in the fridge particularly at this time of year for me thats a small price to pay for the convenience of having a great tasting hot chocolate available on demand who needs fresh food anyway rightcomments are closed
first a word about the packaging it looks quite attractive with a modern feel combined with traditional mayanlooking designs in the shops these bars will have to compete with the likes of lindt and i certainly think they have the edge over the competitionthe card wrappers are really easy to open but my one complaint here is that they dont seem to be resealable in any way once opened up the box cant be stuck back down and the sealed inner foil has to be torn open a minor complaint but im never going to eat a whole g bar in one go so it would be nice to be able to close the pack up after taking a squarei thought id start my tasting session with the two unflavoured bars in the collectionthis is obviously quite a high cocoa percentage but that seems to be the trend for some of the higher end mass market brands these days the first thing i noticed when i opened it though was the strong aroma of vanilla which i found a little disappointingtraditionally vanilla is added to chocolate to cover up any bad flavours but with a finer flavour cocoa like these bars use it shouldnt strictly be necessary  at least not to the extent that its been used herethat vanilla comes through in the taste too although thankfully not as strong as the aroma in fact it turns out to be quite a pleasant and munchable dark chocolate theres little in the way of bitterness and although theres quite a strong cocoa powder flavour you do get just a hint of natural fruitiness its not much but its there its certainly much nicer than the equivalent high percentage lindt barsalthough the flavour is a little more milk than it is chocolate and there isnt much complexity to it i still enjoyed this bar its not too sweet and its very pleasant to nibble onthis bar pictured above is made with the same milk chocolate with the addition of candied orange peel and orange oil im never quite sure about orange chocolate because it always ends up reminding me of terrys chocolate orange  something i used to quite like but now find sweet and sicklythis bar is still a little orangey for me despite being made with natural ingredients i always find the combination of chocolate and orange tastes a little artificial not really my cup of tea but a step up from the old fashioned chocolate orange i know many people who will love this onethis bar again uses the same milk chocolate this time with just a touch of salt there may be just  salt in this bar but it lifts the flavour wonderfully its somehow more chocolatey and even a little sweeter i liked this one a lota slightly sweeter dark chocolate with crunchy cocoa nibs theres a sweetness and very subtle fruitiness to this chocolate but its not particularly complex whats clear is that a lot of thought has gone into the amount of sugar in the chocolate the result is a nice balance of sweetness and intensity and a very munchable dark chocolatecertainly the most unusual flavour of this collection but also my favourite the small pieces of rosemary in this bar have been sugared to give a great crunch while taking off the savoury edge from what from this strongly flavoured herbthe result is something that works incredibly well  if you like rosemary the flavour is sweet at first then develops a gentle spiciness with a rosemary flavour that lingers after the chocolate has melted this is one of those chocolates that really shouldnt work quite as well as it does and im really happy to see something a little different make it through to a more mainstream chocolate brandoverall im impressed with the balance of quality and value of these vanini chocolate bars they arent craft chocolate but they are a step up in quality from supermarket chocolate and even the likes of lindttheyre not widely available in the uk yet but im sure they will be soon in the mean time you can pick them up for  euros a piece from the vanini websitethe rosemary inclusions sound wonderful i havent found any with rosemary here in the us  have you tried any chocolate with basil inclusions  i find that i tend to favor bars with basil inclusions as long as they dont include milk too that becomes too sweethappy tasting
they are nicely presented with colourful wrappers that illustrate what lies inside along with the humorous names theyve been given baroness proudly proclaim that they use a blend of premium couverture chocolate to make their bars which basically means that they buy good quality chocolate with plenty of cocoa butter in it to make it taste rich then mix stuff into it and all the stuff they mix in is homemade apart from nuts and fruit the chocolate they use is also certified organic and uses sustainably harvested beans and they also say that they use different blends of milk semisweet and dark for each of the bars they make although that wasnt always obvious subversive squirrel was my favourite of the seven bars it has some sizeable pieces of peanut brittle in the bar then for maximum peanutiness there are salted peanuts stuck on the back too it also helps that the chocolate is kept darker at least in baroness terms adding a richness to the proceedings this is definitely the one id come back to tantric tiger is dominated by the dried cranberries on the back so how you feel about the bar is going to be determined by your opinion of cranberries there are some almonds and a touch of sea salt which stops it from getting too sweet but the berries were just a bit too much for me love  blessing is the least exciting simply because theres nothing added to the milk and dark chocolate blend left by itself it is kinda dull mocha krunhjay suffers from a bit of an overload of flavours but in the best possible way it has some wonderful big chunks of crunchy sponge toffee mixed through the chocolate and the almond pieces which stud the back of the bar add some more texture the coffee promised on the wrapper is really mild though and just lurks in the background although im not sure thats actually a bad thing the problem with both dob dobs and aiyaaaa was that they took a beat of a beating thanks to canada post so by the time they reached me both had had their innards squished out of them both of them are filled bars  the former with caramel and pecans and the latter with butterscotch and almonds  but they were a bit of sticky mess when i opened them i still ate them though both were a touch sweet for me but since pecans always beat almonds dob dobs wins the day tummy rub is the other satisfyingly good bar with its combination of creamy milk chocolate and chocolate cookie pieces nothing too complicated at all but still like a lovely warm hug in bar form and that really sums up what baroness is doing here  this is really good comfort food the actual chocolate cant compete with the best from the bean to bar world but it really works in this context baroness have definitely found a niche for themselves and hopefully they will continue to experiment with new varieties in the future i would pretty much agree with your assessment of the baroness bars they are highly creative and a lot of fun but not to be thought of in the same sense as pure beantobar everyone i shared them with enjoyed them for what they are a sweet treat of pure fun like yours my filled bars arrived damaged so i suspect they should stick to only mailing the solid bars or changing the packaging to offer more protection
i met owner marc hambrook at the show and had a good chat but i still know relatively little about the business the website is very nice but doesnt go into a great deal of detail about the history of the business how the chocolates are made or where ingredients are sourced when i discover a chocolatier i like these are exactly the kinds of things i want to know more aboutthe chocolates themselves are elegant well made and very nicely presented the box i purchased at the show is a little bashed about entirely my own fault so there are a few loose bits stuck to the otherwise pristine chocolates my only real complaint here is that theres no menu so i had to use the website to work out which chocolate was which best i could in fact there was no information of any kind in the box including ingredients list im sure theyre coming though so im not too concerned update marc tells me menus are now included in every boxthere are some great chocolates in this box including some wonderfully smooth ganaches but the highlights for me were the caramels in particular the cobnut caramel the square chocolate with the ribbon design above i cheekily stole er asked nicely and sampled one of these on the opening night of the show and they really are fantastic im not a fan of nuts by any means but the rich toasted flavours combined with the deep muscovado caramel in this chocolate are to die for i could easily eat a whole box of these the black salt caramel is almost as good but at around half the size of a paul a young caramel i really wanted this one to be biggerthere are things that didnt work so well for me in the box too one of the chocolates  i think a mulberry gin truffle tasted amazing but was dusted in white icing sugar not the most appetising looking chocolate and the cause of most of the stray bits on the chocolates you see in my photos the same goes for the cherry  almond crumble wonderful flavours but the chocolate itself is coated in a crumble which doesnt look so good and tends to float around the boxthese are very minor issues though and in all honestly only an annoyingly finicky chocolate reviewer would even mention them the box is packed full of great chocolates with well balanced flavours and would make a fantastic gift for any chocolate lover highly recommendedyour favourite was mine too  that cobnut caramel could become a classic looking forward to what marc does next 
these brownies have a lot to live up to though i first heard about them well over a year ago when lauden owners sun and steven trigg told me they had made the most amazing brownies but lost the recipe since then they have been on a quest to recreate that mythical browniethe box contains four small brownies its an unusual format that works well for me each brownie is just enough to satisfy a chocolate craving without overindulging theyre great for sharing or simply for pacing yourself one little brownie makes the perfect afternoon pickmeupi loved laudens brownies but experience has shown brownies are a very personal thing and everyone seems to have a different idea of what makes a good oneone friend found them to be a little dry for his tastes but i cant help but think he might be comparing them to paul a youngs delicious lumps of moist gooeyness which arent strictly brownies at all if youre after something more traditional youd have to go a long way to beat this particular browniecomments are closed
that might not be entirely fair though because it might just be that it is completely overwhelmed by the little chunks of toffee which are definitely the star of the show or at least they are if you like your toffee a little bit on the burnt side which i do theres also a healthy dose of sea salt thrown in too and that makes periodic appearances as you munch awaysadly the pieces of nuts are rather small and dont really add much to the entire experience personally id have rather had a bit more nuttiness considering they get equal billing on the box and even if the pieces were big enough to add some crunch then id at least know they were there considering that this only costs a couple of dollars this is a perfectly acceptable bar of chocolate but that price tag should also bring some lowered expectations with it too the bar is definitely a little one note but thats ok if its a note that you enjoy it isnt enough to turn me into a trader joes convert but chances are ill seek one out next time im south of the bordercomments are closed
this year one of my favourite chocolate brands chocolat madagascar were exhibiting and had a full range of chocolate on show i loved everything they had on offer but there was one particular bar that really stood out this organic  baropen the wrapper and youre greeted by a most wonderful warming fruity aroma to me it smells like christmas whats more it looks like a work of art toothe flavour is unlike any bar ive tasted its full of raisins and molasses with the typical madagascan citrus notes almost lurking in the background im sure that part of the flavour comes from the organic sugar but it works perfectly with the natural fruity notes in the chocolate to produce a unique and wonderful baras it turns out its also great for pairing with drinks chocolatier paul wayne gregory chose this chocolate in a whisky  chocolate pairing we attended last week and it went down very well indeedif and when you do find it do make sure you go for the organic  bar rather than the  bar both are delicious but this is the one you really wanti looooved the madagascar  have you tried that one i actually think this one would be too sweet for methey dont have this one yet  nobody does because its currently on a boat from madagascar  note that the organic  is different from the regular wow what a great review of what sounds like great chocolate and for you to call it your favourite chocolate of the moment especially from you is really saying something truly amazed i did say of the moment because my favourite changes from moment to moment but this is really good
these days when i go shopping for chocolate i tend to look for the unusual i have a few reliable goto bars that i know will keep me happy but after that i prefer to search out something which ive never had before and my last big shopping trip offered me quite a few choices which fell into the unusual categorythe whole thing tastes just like a chocolatey banoffee pie with some nuts along for the ride and thats a very good thing indeedit is however incredibly rich and decadent to the point that one of the oversize squares was more than enough for me at one time but it is still the first banana chocolate which i can say that i genuinely enjoyed and id even go as far to say that id pick up another one consider me convertedoh my that caramelwow does sound as if they have chucked a whole lot of flavours into one bar how was the banana flavour as im a bit suspicious of banana flavours unless there is actual banana in it foodnerd xhttpwwwfoodnerdlifecomthe banana flavour is rather good and thats from someone who isnt the biggest fan they use natural flavourings according to the box and that seems to help it from being too overwhelming  you should definitely give it a try
founded by conservationist philipp kauffmann original beans puts conservation at the heart of everything they do in fact for every bar purchased the company plants a tree in the rainforest and both the outer wrapper in the foil inside are made from wood and are completely compostable by eating this chocolate you really are having a positive impact on the planetbut theres more to original beans than just ethics  their chocolate is reasonably priced and tastes great too kauffmann spends much of his time searching out rare and forgotten cacao and this papua kerafat bar is no exceptionnow if you judge a chocolate on name alone you might think this bar is made with beans from papua new guinea  a common choice for many beantobar chocolate makers but its actually made with beans from the indonesian province of papua on the western side of the island of new guineathat might seem like a small thing but new guinea is the second largest island in the world and consequently has a huge variety of cacao traditionally beans from papua new guinea are dried over fires giving them a smoky flavour but these indonesian beans have been dried more conventionally or at least more carefully revealing more of the true flavours of the cacaothose flavours as it turns out are really rather good open the foil wrapper and youre greeted by a wonderfully rich warm cocoa aromaas you can see my bar is a little battered having travelled from original beans hq in the netherlands to get to me but that hasnt affected the flavour at all it has a smooth buttery texture and an intense chocolatey flavour theres a hint of cocoa powder flavour and a touch of astringency to it but for me those just enhance the chocolatinessas it melts it reveals a gentle fruity acidity the tasting notes on the packet describe it as pear and dried fruit and im not going to argue with that its like a smooth buttery pear dipped in cocoa powder if you can imagine thatoriginal beans papua kerafat is currently only available through a very limited number of stores but thats purely because its no new i expect it to be widely available very soon and recommend trying someid love to try that one the shop near my office that used to sell original beans has subbed in another brand i think olive  sinclair  not the same
ive been lucky enough to try a slew of new british beantobar chocolates recently and ill be sharing some of my discoveries here over the next few weeksmichael has a passion for ethics and sustainability sourcing his beans directly from the farmers and transporting them with zero carbon footprint he tells me the beans are transported by sail ship into the local harbour at falmouth and then by horse drawn carriage to the factory up the road for a little added showmanship if thats true its something i would love to seethe packaging is both elegant and functional the bars are sealed inside paper bags and slipped into an attractive card pouch that can easily be resealed theres plenty of information on the label too i can tell you that this is batch c and the trinitario beans were conched for  hours its  cocoa solids  milk solids and contains just three ingredients cocoa beans raw cane sugar and whole milk powderthe moulding on the bar wasnt quite perfect on my bar but due to a courier who had clearly decided to play football with my parcel its not worth me showing it suffice to say even broken into a few pieces it was well tempered and looked goodthe tasting notes describe javan milk as rich and creamy milk chocolate with clotted cream notes and occasional hints of raisin and fudge but i got another flavour note and i got it big time coconut  in fact there is a coconutty aroma the moment you open the packet now i dont know if this is something to do with how the chocolate has been stored aged or something in the beans themselves but i happen to love coconut and i love this chocolateits very creamy you can almost taste fresh cream and has a very pleasant chocolatey flavour and that hint of fudge is certainly there too but coconut is the dominant flavour here and if thats your thing you really will love this barone of the joys of small batch chocolate is that i have no idea if this is deliberate or if the next batch will taste anything like this one where mass produced chocolate is specifically designed to maintain a uniform flavour with every batch chocolate like this changes and evolves with different harvests slight variations in the roast the conche and even how the chocolate is storedfor now though im very happy with this creamy coconutty milk chocolate if you love those flavours and youre looking to trade up to something a little better then i highly recommend giving this a goclotted cream raisin fudge sounds like cornwall im undecided on coconut notes in chocolate but certainly the fudge raisin and clotted cream would have pleased me

its the kind of organisation that has me in two minds one the one hand its a worker owned cooperative thats producing and promoting fairly traded products but on the other hand its a relatively big brand with a large range of products made in big factories i cant help thinking that the quality of some of the smaller chocolate makers who buy direct from farmers  producers isnt going to translate into a big umbrella brand like thisdespite the indepth story on the wrapper im still unclear where the cacao for this bar comes from there is a photo of a farmer from peru on the back and panama ecuador peru and the dominican republic are mentioned on the inside of the wrapper i assume that means this is some kind of blend of those origins which seems a shame given some of the fine flavour cacao thats grown in the individual countrieswhat i can tell you is that its a  cocoa solids dark chocolate so theres a fair amount of sugar along with candied ginger lemon oil and black pepperso how does it taste well almost exactly like youd expectthe sweetness of the chocolate and the flavour of the ginger hit you first followed swiftly by a nicely balanced lemon finally the heat from the ginger and black pepper hit you and stay with you long after the chocolate has gonewhile its interesting and the flavours do go together quite well the black pepper isnt really necessary here the ginger alone would have been enough for a pleasant lingering warmth as it is half an hour after trying the bar i still have the heat from the pepper in my mouth and im ready for it to go away nowi really wanted to like this chocolate but its just trying too hard for my tastes the wealth of information on the wrapper that doesnt explain simple things like where the chocolate comes from isnt compelling or exciting the flavours in chocolate had a similar effect on me theres too much going on with a lack of focuscomments are closed
you might be wondering how they get coconut into a flat bar like this theres not much to see on the front of the chocolate its a little scuffed understandable given the distance it has travelled to get into my greedy paws and divided into four large chunks but wheres the coconutyou have to turn the bar over to find itnow admittedly those eight little piles of beige flakes dont look like much but they do have plenty of flavour locked inside them of course youre not going to get that moist chewy bounty like experience from some toasted coconut flakes but you do get a decent amount flavourif youre anything like me when you place a small piece on your tongue and youll immediately be transported back to childhood memories of stuffing a bounty into your face and chewing forever but let it melt for a few seconds something wonderful happens those coconut flavours are engulfed and overwhelmed by the wonderfully citrus sweet and intense flavours naturally present in the madagascan cocoa its rare to find a chocolate that can hold its own against an added flavour and even rarer to find one where the chocolate tastes this goodtechnically the fruity acidity of the chocolate and creaminess of the coconut are probably not the best matched flavour combination in the world but i personally love it it evokes childhood memories and takes me on a flavour journey reminding me why i love the complexity of single origin chocolate and why i dont eat bounty any morei dont know how easy they are to get in the uk but if you like coconut in your chocolate i would recommend you check out fearless chocolate exploding coconutsi went to waitrose to get some of these before the offer ran out i have nibbled the coconut chocolate it wasnt very coconutty the chocolate was very strong and tangy i could only stand it in small doses but it was good i might try letting it melt and see if the flavours come out better i bought two other flavours  it cost me
these stores each with their own roaster winnower conch and tempering machine used to be known as roastconch but the company has rebranded its stores so often lately im not sure they even have a name now suffice to say you can buy the rabot  bars online and in just about any hotel chocolat shopthis particular bar was purchased in the brighton store where i was offered a piece to taste it was interesting enough that i ended up buying a whole bar to take homeif youre the kind of person who always wants to know more about their chocolate then you wont be disappointed with the wealth of information on this pack the front tells me its made with  harvest beans from the mekong delta  dong nai its roasted for  minutes at c and conched for  hours by senior chocolatier kiri kalenkoon the inside you can read the story of hotel chocolats rabot estate plantation in saint lucia as well as a little history of vietnamese cocoatheres also a tastometer chart that manages to plot the flavour profiles cocoa of different origins onto a single line it seems to be an attempt to say this bar is fruity but not as fruity as some madagascan origin bars as flavour profiles arent a one dimensional thing and i dont think its particularly helpful here but some may find it useful the tasting notes on the front describe it as a dragon with a taste for red fruit and it turns out thats a pretty good way to describe it initially it seems like it might bite your head off but give it a moment and the wonderfully sweet cherry and raspberry notes come to the front before the flavour finally transitions to something quite smooth and smoky its really rather goodthis is certainly not the kind of chocolate you eat in one go but a couple of pieces make a great afternoon pickmeup note that if you buy it online from the link below the product description refers to a  harvest version of this bar with slightly different tasting notes you may or may not get this more recent version when you buy yoursseriously love the packaging and its attempt to educate both expert and the casual chocolate lover have had some interesting eating from the rabot range  look forward to more of your reviewsi like vietnamese cocoa love the acidity ive only tried a marou bar just like madagascan cocoa how does it compare with the marou range which is truly excellent quality vietnamese chocolatei would say it compares very favourably to the similarly high cocoa solids  tien giang but given a choice i would still pick the marou  particularly the  tien giang or  ba ria
although at  a bar lillie belle farms chocolate isnt cheap that first taste was enough to have me wanting more and so on my most recent trip to selfridges i picked up this bar a  milk chocolate with a twistas you can see its a beautiful looking bar with its unique design and deep reddish brown colour its almost a shame to break off a chunk but when you do you are rewarded with a chocolate that tastes good as it looksthe fruitiness of the peruvian cocoa beans is evident and works exceptionally well with the milk  buttermilk combination i cant say i can taste any cheese which may or may not be a good thing depending on your point of viewits a rich and creamy flavour with a wonderful buttery malty note theres a hint of smokiness suggesting a fairly high roast  something im not usually keen on but its a flavour combination that i love in this chocolateif youre into rich and creamy milk chocolates then i recommend seeking this out i cant wait to try the rest of the lillie belle farms rangecomments are closed
technically though you could argue that pauls brownies arent brownies at all they contain so little flour that theyre more like a dense gooey block of ganache than a traditional brownie but frankly i dont care rules are there to be broken and i love that moist sticky gooeynessi was sent a tray  portions in each of both chocolate brownies and salted caramel brownies and theyre really rather good these are clearly proper brownies with a nice crisp top but what made them stand out for me is just how soft and gooey they are inside theyr deliciously moist and really very tasty light in texture but rich and intense in flavour these brownies are perhaps a little sweeter and not quite as chocolatey as a paul a young creation but theres no doubting that these little treats are most definitely proper brownies having tried a couple of slices of each for me its the salted caramel brownie that wins the day the extra flavour from the caramel really makes the differencethis is my first experience of galeta and im impressed with the product and service and it just  for a whole tray of chocolate brownies theyre pretty good value toofudgy centre crisp top beeeeeaaaaautifullooks amazing i have actually heard several good stories about the treats from galeta do they deliver outside the uk
by combining cocoa mass samples from origins around the world or noir can create a chocolate with practically any flavour profile its an exciting idea and a place i would love to visit but there is a part of me that thinks this is quite far away from the more natural process that modern beantobar artisans use when they create chocolateim used to makers that will search the world for the best beans treat them with care and coax the best possible flavours from a single origin but im sure there is a place for both approaches and i was interested to try the chocolate roux createdthe texture is smooth and slightly soft suggesting a high cocoa butter content and has an initial bitterness that slowly gives way to more of a cocoa powder flavour the fruitiness is very subtle but is there overall the flavour is pleasant but this is certainly not a bar of chocolate i would go out and buywith those strong cocoa notes i suspect it would make a great chocolate for baking or even a couverture for filled chocolates  providing the fillings had interesting flavours of their own indeed on the show roux cooked with the chocolate rather than simply eating it in bar formatwhile theres nothing wrong with it as a chocolate its just not very interesting what i cant say is if thats down to rouxs personal tastes or the or noir process and i think the only real way to know that would be to visit or noir and make my own chocolatedid you taste coconut i just remember michel mentioning the distinct coconut on the showhowever much callebauts sales reps sorryi belive they are called gourmet managers now or pr push this i still cannot believe its very artisan
a white chocolate sphere with a white chocolate and lemon filling the filling also seems to contain small pieces of pastry which give it an unusual texture and a slightly doughy flavour its a little odd but actually very nice  a little like licking cookie dough out of the bowla milk chocolate sphere rolled in toasted breadcrumbs with a centre of pure marmalade i was expecting some kind of marmalade ganache mixed with chocolate here so was somewhat surprised to have a mouthful of orange marmalade as the thin shell melted its very nice marmalade but its a little like eating a big spoonful straight out of the jar i cant help but think a nice dark chocolate  marmalade ganache would have worked better here both in terms of flavour and texturea dark chocolate sphere with a dark ganache made with stilton and a hint of port this one is a little unusual all the elements are there and can be tasted but its just a little too cheesy for me i have to confess im not a big stilton fan but equally i know people who would love this one of my favourite chocolatiers paul a young is known for a port  stilton chocolate and im not that keen on that one eithera simple milk chocolate cup with a bakewell flavoured filling this captures the flavour of an actual bakewell tart quite accurately but its a little sweet for my personal tastesa square chocolate with a gold finish and a raspberry caramel filling the filling here is actually more of a thin raspberry jam than a caramel theres a good raspberry flavour but again its a little sweet for me i would have preferred a richer caramel with a just hint of raspberry my favourite of the bunch a simple dark chocolate ganache with subtle flavour i probably wouldnt have been able to identify the flavour as gin  tonic had i not been told but its herbaceous and a little citrus and really quite enjoyable if i had one issue with it its that there was quite a bit of air between the filling and the shell that not only means that you get less but im sure will also have an impact on shelf lifeoverall then this is a pleasant little collection but it does lack some of the attention to detail of the higher end artisan chocolates ive tried over the years i didnt get much of a sense of the actual chocolate used daniel is primarily using belgian chocolate from callebaut which is a good staple for chocolatiers but often lacks more nuanced flavours that could be paired with the individual flavoursim sure that with a little tweaking and refinement to the flavours and production process they could be great then again that would probably have an impact on price  something which can have a huge impact for a small chocolatier at the moment theyre the kind of chocolates i would happily consume and share but theyre not quite at a level where i would buy them as a luxurious giftcomments are closed
i love the name and branding but i particularly like the box the thin card wrapper with has a simple paper sleeve to keep it closed and it feels like a quality product most importantly of all the design means i can reseal the pack after taking a chunk or two with a quality chocolate bar its really important to be able to wrap the bar up again because its not something you tend to eat in one go omnoms packaging means i can keep the bar with me and not have to worry about stray chunks and crumbs at the bottom of my bag its the little things that make for a great chocolate experiencetheres a slightly soft texture to the chocolate although im sure thats in no small part down to the current hot weather in london at the time of writing consequently the chocolate has a quick melt and releases its flavour rapidlythe fruity citrus notes are there in the flavour but theyre much more subtle than i was expecting from the aroma instead theres a prominent liquorice flavour note and some rather interesting floral flavours it doesnt kick you in the face like some madagascan chocolates but instead takes you on a more gentle and interesting ridethe friend who gave me this bar told me it was great but perhaps not as refined as it could be personally though i love it i love that its not the same as every other madagascan origin chocolate bar i love the flavour and i love the way its presentedi love to discover new chocolate bars and its so helpful to read detailed chocolate reviews like this one  now i have to try and find it in a store my personal favourite is   papua new guinea its crazy good but also different from any other pure chocolate i have ever had it claims to have taste notes such as  smoky tobacco burned oak and bourbon id say its more than notes the first taste blew me away it was a whisky smoky tobacco nutty explotion in my mouth the texture is soft as silk and leaves you with a long aftertaste of perfectly bitter kakao
ive had chocolate with popping candy before but theres a crazy amount in here  breaking the bar reveals that it is positively studded with the stuff as soon as the chocolate starts to melt the popping takes over at an alarming rate and the bar really lives up to the latter half of its name there were even a couple of occasions when i bit off a corner and the level of explosion i was greeted with made me jump just a little the bottom line is that this really is a fun bar of chocolate what it lacks in fieriness it makes up for with its all out attack on the interior of your mouth and it is pretty tasty too it also works as a great introduction for those trying to enter a more adventurous world of chocolate because it is very different but not in an intimidating way plus it is a lot of fun so there dom great review and your writing made me feel like trying some and the kids would love it too where can you get it in the uk merci davancei didnt write this michael our canadian writer did as far as i know its not available in the uk except onlinesorry for confusion dom we will have to importwhat  local shopthis does indeed sound like a fun bar of chocolate i love bars with popping candy every once in awhile and putting a touch of sea salt and chipotle would definitely take ones taste buds on a wild ridespookily i had some of this bar today i love it my friend brought it back from america for me i have to watch my sugar intake and carbs in general and this bar is perfect on that count and it has a reasonable volume of fibre in it too for a bar of chocolate it is pretty healthy as well as tasty and deserves to be more widely availablethink this is a fun chocolatebar 
based in oregon lillie belle was founded by jeff shepherd and named after his wife and daughter they started making truffles  years ago a lifetime ago in chocolate industry terms but only started producing their own chocolate from the bean last yeari picked up this  madagascar bar from selfridges in london the packaging is distinctive and unique but not entirely my cup of tea theres certainly no mistaking the maker but when im paying  for a bar i want unwrapping it to be part of the pleasure it doesnt quite feel like a high value product when presented in an environment like selfridges where it is displayed next to some beautifully packaged bars and thats a shame because this bar is really rather interestingwith hundreds of bars in front of me to choose from what drew me to this one was the fact that it has been made with two different bean roasts cocoa beans are almost always roasted as part of the chocolate making process and the time and temperature of that roast has a significant effect on the flavour of the finished chocolate roast them too long and the chocolate will have a burnt flavour not enough and the real chocolate flavours wont develop at allthe idea of using two different roasts is that the finished chocolate will take you on a journey in theory it should add an extra layer of complexity to the flavour bringing out a full range of flavours within the bean but it also adds complexity to the chocolate making process and if the roasts arent timed extremely carefully it could easily go wrong so did lillie belle farms get it right well  almostive tasted several bars made with madagascan cocoa that have a similar high roast recently and this is by no means the most roasted its actually a pleasant flavour but it does tend to hide rather than accentuate the natural flavour of the bean roast time is a very difficult thing to get right and not something you can change after the fact its also quite a personal thing so you could equally put it down to me having slightly different tastes to the chocolate makerthat said this is still a great bar and ill be picking up some more from lillie belle they also produce a  milk chocolate with blue cheese which i think i have to trydear domthank you for the review i understand your hesitancy about my packaging i really do you see i despise the norm i go out of my way to make my products and packaging reflect my personality there is no marketing team focus groups or hired help to brand our products there is only me an over weight cacao pod tattooed chocoholic with no social filter i make excellent products with an honesty and focus so incredibly personal that i am thrilled to be finding chocolate fans world wide who appreciate my art i agree with you chocolate making is hard and attempting to combine two roasts took huge nerve  but this is as are all of my creations that wind up on store shelves a personal and very subjective taste that appeal to me in a way that says lets share this madagascar beans tend to very acidic and having tasted dozens and dozens of others i set out to make something a touch different than the rest as for the labelswhat can i say i saw the grateful dead hundreds of times i am what many used call a hippie and unashamedly so  if we ever met it would all make sense and you would get the joke instantly thanks for the reviewpeace and chocolatejeffhow great that the maker comments on the review well done jeff i like the packaging and id love to try the bar i wonder if they sell it in manchesteri also think its wonderful that the chocolate maker comments on reviews and in an honest objective way keep going jeff and hope to try a bar soon
all robins cakes have a distinctive look and feel to them they are beautifully and expertly crafted but always have a handmade sugarcraft finish to them if youre after fine patisserie then these creations may not be for you but if you want a cake that truly looks as though its been made with love by a real person then theyre a wonderful choicei have to say i love my cake it tastes great and nothing really beats the thrill of having something made especially for you delivered to your door whether it be something special for a corporate event of a character birthday cake for a child i can thoroughly recommend robins amazing creationscomments are closed
of course selfridges have the overheads of running a very large physical department store to take into account and i am regularly arguing that we should all be paying more for our chocolate in this case the discrepancy is a little uncomfortable for me thoughbut back to the chocolate itself these small dried berries really pack a fruity punch that i think will appeal to anyone who loves fruity chocolate the intensely citrus flavour is rounded off perfectly by the smooth  dark chocolate but theyre just a bit too sharp to prevent you from eating the whole lot in one goi found that although the box looked small g was enough to last me at least a couple of days  the same amount of time a good quality dark chocolate bar would last theyre perfect for carrying around in your bag for a quick pickmeup and unlike most chocolate bars the box is easy to close and keep the contents firmly inside rather than rattling around your bagthoroughly recommended  but i would love to see them more widely availablecomments are closed
tesco might not be the first place you turn when youre on the hunt for fine chocolate  it certainly isnt for me  but as tastes change more and more were seeing supermarkets jump on the single origin own label bandwagonits something i have mixed feelings about while its great that were all becoming aware of better quality chocolate own brand single origin bars are often difficult to trace and made with lower quality cocoa in order to keep prices downso how does this little  bar made with madagascan beans stack upthat aside its a nice enough looking bar with a nice simple ingredients list to boot cocoa mass sugar cocoa butter vanilla extract the one thing that tends to mark this kind of single origin own brand chocolate apart is that very rarely will you find nasties like added vegetable fatsthe flavour notes on the wrapper describe it as predominantly rich cocoa throughout with notes of fresh fruit and a hint of honey those notes may be a little vague but they are quite accurate its unusual for a madagascan bar in that you dont get the normal blast of citrus flavour notes from it instead its more subtle rounded and gentleon face value id recommend giving it a go but there is one little fly in the ointment the pricealthough i cant find this particular bar on the tesco website the other bars in the range are retailing at  for a g bar at that price i have to wonder where the money is going if the farmers are getting a fair deal if its being made in a huge automated factory and to what extent expert chocolatiers were involved in the processi was thinking of trying tescos origin range but that was before seeing they add vanilla now im not too sure but your description of the flavour makes it sound like an easy chocolate to eatgot a trialsized bar of this on the go at the moment  and youre bang on have you tried the nonfinest ownbrand  ivory coast  ecuador bar tastewise at least im a fan
when cioccolato tavoletta said they were sending me a few samples from italy i wasnt expecting the giant crate that arrived at my door containing a small bag of everything from the tavoletta rangeas it turns out the sheer volume of chocolate they sent it as difficult to photograph as it is to consume so in order to make my life a little easier i decanted a couple of each chocolate onto a platethere much betterstill theres rather a lot to get through so rather than writing about them all im just going to pick out a few of my personal highlightsthese simple milk or dark chocolate bars are filled with gianduja chocolate combined with hazelnut paste while the dark chocolate version is nice the shell is a little bitter but the milk chocolate version is deliciously creamy and nuttyone of the more unusual and interesting chocolates in the collection a white chocolate ganache made with cream thats been infused with parmesan although the texture is a little grainy it kind of works theres a definite hint of parmesan to it and its not too sweet for a white chocolate eitherthe website describes this as a diamond shaped praline in dark chocolate encasing a creamy crunchy fruity salty and spice infused filling but doesnt actually go into specifics about what the fruity  spicy flavours are tasting it theyre quite subtle but work very nicely i dont know what it is but i kinda like itanother chocolate that comes in both milk and dark chocolate versions a three pronged chocolate where each prong contains a while roasted piedmont hazelnut as with previous chocolates i think the milk version works a little better but either way these simple chocolates are quite moreishi love fruity chocolates and the flavour of this dark chocolate with quince apple jelly did was great it was a little let down by a very thick chocolate base that made it quite difficult to eat but it was still a favourite for memuch of this range are quite traditional pralines which are fine but theyre just not my thing for me theres only so many ways you can combine nuts and chocolate before it starts to get a little repetitive for the most part though i did enjoy this selection in terms of quality theyre above average but unfortunately not outstanding thats partly down to european tastes which are more conservative than some of the top london chocolatiers that im used to but id still love to see a few more imaginative flavours most importantly at all id like to see higher quality chocolate used  particularly in the dark chocolatesi like the sound of the parmigiano and the walnut one
luck for us vivanis way of rectifying this situation was to send us a big box of new bars to write aboutso without further ado heres some of the highlights of the selection they sent us starting with two single origin barsits not often you find single origin milk chocolates at vivanis pricepoint under  per g bar so i was intrigued to try it unusually its made with coconut blossom sugar rather than cane sugar along with both milk and cream powderit has a soft texture and a flavour thats chocolatey if perhaps a little too roasted its not particularly complex and the flavour of the cream is also quite prominent as a result it wasnt really my cup of teaanother bar sweetened with coconut blossom sugar this time though theres only three ingredients cocoa mass and cocoa butter being the other two one things clear from the start with this bar  theres quite a lot of cooca butter in it the flavour is intense but ultimately very approachable of really quite tasty as with the milk chocolate bar its not particularly complex but there is a hint of fruit in the background its a much better bar than the milk and one i found very enjoyableas with the  bar its quite high in cocoa butter meaning its not overly intense but neither is it too sweet all in all another very enjoyable barthe rest of the vivani bars have a slightly chunkier format and more sugar this one comes in at  cocoa solids and the thick chunks are filled with a gooey sticky marzipanlike substance thats much closer to the german confectionery version of marzipan than anything ive experienced elsewhere its too sweet and too soft for me but those with a very sweet tooth might like it and germansaccording to the wrapper this chocolate is made with organic rice drink powder that might seem a little odd but it really translates as rice milk chocolate  a milk chocolate made without dairy thats important because it means that it can be enjoyed by the millions of people who for whatever reason cant have dairythe flavour is quite pleasant and theres certainly a hint of cereal in there i dont know that i would eat it regularly but as a milk chocolate substitute i found it more than acceptablefinally we have a range of smaller format g barsthis  dark chocolate with small pieces of black cherry is quite addictive so its probably good it comes in a small format the chocolate dark chocolate is relatively sweet but works very well with the sour cherries that cut through the sweetness just enougha  milk chocolate with creamy caramel filling im not much of fan of long shelf life caramels as they tend to be full of preservatives and i have to say this wasnt my thing the milk chocolate is sweet but the filling is insanely sweet and buttery probably my least favourite of the whole selectionthe description on the wrapper  dark milk chocolate with a crispy espresso cream filling  sums this up quite well although at  cocoa solids its not particularly dark its still too sweet for my personal taste but the combination of coffee and biscuity crunch do work quite well togetherfinally we have another bar featuring the rice milk chocolate  this time with small pieces of granulated orange the result is a flavour similar to but perhaps a little better than a terrys chocolate orange  but importantly in a chocolate thats suitable for those who cant have dairy again not really my thing but i know plenty of people who would like it simply because its one of the few milk chocolates they can eatall in all vivani have a good selection of bars especially considering the price point i would put them in the same kind of category as lindt but actually rate the chocolate a little higher the  bar is particularly approachable and if you have any kind of dairy allergy the rice milk chocolates are worth seeking out toohmmmupon first seeing the picture of the  cocoa milk bar i thought it was something id love to try given my weakness for high cocoa milk bars something ill always blame on a couple of zotter labooko wonders now im starting to think otherwise not just because of the review but also because of my previous experiences with vivani chocolatesif i am to look back i dont think there was ever a vivani bar that i really enjoyed and wasnt a dark chocolate one and its not like i dont have a sweet toothi sometimes try somewhat similar bars in parallel i did that with vivanis superior ecuador bars both the milk  cocoa one and the dark  cocoa one  i preferred the dark one also with one of the milk chocolate felix bar and the plain dark creamy bar  i found the dark one to be way betterso i guess the next vivani bar ill try is going to be the dark cranberry one which ive had for quite a while but there was always something more interesting to try until now ill also be looking for the dark cherry one though the range imported here is pretty limitedps  i think lindt still ranks higher for me their range is absolutely huge and despite having tried so many of their products for the past ten years every once in a while i still find something new i really enjoy  like the boozy truffles earlier this yeari think you should definitely try the cranberry one i also liked the cherry one but the milks were all a bit too sweet for me having said that my flatmate  who has a sweeter tooth than me and is also lactose intolerant  loved the rice milk and the little bit of the  milk she tried its all very personalim not jealous im not jealous  im not jealous  really not jealous   okay so i am  i would give anything to try that  dominican milk chocolate with coconut sugar  and that  sounds appealing too  thanks for the info  will have to add these to my chocolate to try listthat sounds delicious i wish i could taste and try them all
in this case the filling is made into a smooth ganache thats really rather tasty its made with orange concentrate apple balsamic vinegar and grappa and has a good balance of chocolate orange and acidity from the vinegar the entire bar is wrapped in a thin layer of zotters  beantobar mountain milk chocolate its very nice but with such a thin layer it doesnt bring a lot to the party as with most of the hand scooped range this is all about the fillingi found this bar all to easy to eat the texture is light enough that its almost like eating a piece of chocolate cake rather than a chocolate bar and consequently it disappeared a little too quicklyof course there are many people who simply dont like the combination of chocolate and orange  or have had their tastebuds forever tainted by the terrys chocolate orange personally i liked this a lot its obviously not the most refined chocolate experience but in terms of quality and flavour its a huge step up from your average confectionery chocolate bari am one of those many people who do not like orange and chocolate together but your pictures make this chocolate look so good and the orange colour on the packaging makes it look so citrusyi agree  its amazing how much the packaging can influence you isnt itlooks delicious need to try make one of those 
as you might imagine i get offered all kinds of chocolate related products for review here but with limited time i have to turn many offers that dont fit into the usual bars or truffles categories down this one however caught my attentionthe very next day i was informed that yoosli was amazing addictive and awesome but not as a healthy breakfast  as a late night snack eaten straight out of the boxit quickly became clear that i was going to have to do things properlyit turns out that when consumed with a little milk andor natural yoghurt theyre equally good the clusters have a great crunch and a nice balance between the chocolate and berry flavours most importantly of all grown up cocoa pops lovers will be glad to know they even turn the milk chocolateyi have to confess im not normally a breakfast person its been quite a while since ive had any breakfast cereal at least any that doesnt come in a handy bar format but ive been rather taken with my yoosli my g box is now almost gone and im starting to regret giving the other two boxes awayif i have one reservation its that a quick glance at the ingredients does reveal non hydrogenated palm oil fairly high up on the list im sure its necessary for holding the clusters together or something but its something i would rather not be consumingbut that really is the only downside i can find to what a very tasty breakfast cereal  and late night snackthis seems so yum yummy i wanna taste this tooit just had to have a disgusting and unethical ingredient somewhere ill stick to my porridge
the thing i noticed when buying these is that theres quite a lot of crossover between the flavours here and zotters hand scooped and mitzi blue ranges for many of the chocolates in this range what youre getting is mini versions of the bigger barsi had thought i was being quite restrained only buying  but thats too many to write about individually so instead i just want to talk about some of the highlights in my own box its a box that i picked out from my own personal preferences so its perfectly possible ive missed out on something amazing next time ill just have to buy a bigger boxa soft and creamy white chocolate ganache covered in a thin layer of white chocolate as ganaches go this is quite thick but its very smooth and has a wonderful citrus burst with a gentle alcoholic kicka dark chocolate truffle ball with an intensely zingy blackcurrant flavour if you love fruit flavour chocolates as much as i do this one will really hit the spota simple delicious hazelnut nougat square decorated with blue flowers  similar to zotters mitsy blue range i love the nougat but i did find the flowers stuck in my teeth a littlea caramel nougat in a very thin layer of caramel white chocolate this replicates one of zotters hand scooped bars but actually works better in this smaller format its sweet with a pleasant crunch and a very nice biscuity caramel flavoura double layered square chocolate with a layer of soft marzipan sat on top of a cherry jelly i loved the contrast in textures in this chocolate the cherry layer has an unusual chewy foamy texture and the marzipan practically melts in the mouthoverall its an interesting and unique approach to truffles and pralines that im very glad to have sampled personally i still prefer the bars particularly the solid single origin labooko range but these still make a great gift  and something a little different from your average box of chocolatei still have petals in my teeth thoughthe ones w flowers are beautiful  did the flowers impart any tastepersonally i still prefer the bars particularly the solid single origin labooko rangei feel the same way the crazy flavour combinations are always incredibly tempting to me theyre really well done and i enjoy them but if i had to pick a favourite range id definitely go for the plain single origin labooko because the chocolate gets to be in the spotlight there and its really good chocolate
the chocolate itself looks typically pretty  nice and shiny with an interesting series of lines that guarantees that only strangelyshaped pieces can be snapped off when it comes to flavour though i was a little underwhelmed that isnt to say that this isnt a decent bar of chocolate but it lacks the specialness i was hoping forit starts off promisingly enough with plenty of smooth robust chocolate notes but just as it begins to build up some momentum it stops some of that is down to the added vanilla which is always there without being too obvious but theres a distinct lack of complexity from the beans there might be the slightest suggestion of citrus and berries as it lingers but it just isnt enough to elevate this from being surprisingly onedimensionalmaybe they are still finding their feet when it comes to this particular location but considering that this is a valrhona bar i was expecting more im not willing to give up on loma sotavento yet though and ill be back to see what the  vintage has to offer howd i end up here on the internet  i thought i was turning a corner to the end of the tubes but find a wonderful blog on chocolate   what caught my eye on this entry was the shape of the pieces that make up the bar   the distinct shapes look so much like they would fit better in the mouth with the wide end towards the back of the throat better than a standard rectangle   anyways what a delight to find your blog i shall have to check in when the urge for chocolate strikes  for for today  im a boring person that until now thought chocolate was just chocolate   thank you for changing my mindmaybe they are still finding their feet when it comes to this particular location  theres always something a connoisseur of chocolate in writing will say that makes me think and just smile and that was the quote from this write up oh and in the summer i shall be travelling the south of framce and plan on buying valrhona any you highly regard and could suggesthiis valrhona selling pure cocoa chocolate bar
in my head i expected every single convenience store that i visited in tokyo to have shelf upon shelf of kit kats but that really isnt the case usually you can find the standard milk chocolate variety and also green tea but nothing terribly exotic  that takes a bit more workthere is a special kit kat store the chocolatory which opened at the beginning of  apparently it has some unique flavours only on sale at that one location but i didnt have enough time to search it out instead i relied on the souvenir stores which had a decent enough selection of more unusual varieties for curious tourists to purchase by the time i was done i had accrued seven different flavours strawberry cheesecake rum raisin sakura matcha beniimo hojicha roasted tea wasabi and hot japanese chili heres my thoughtsstrawberry cheesecake like almost all of these is covered in flavoured white chocolate with some extra sandwiched between the wafers to make sure theres no doubt what variety is being consumed and this is definitely strawberry thats about all really pleasant enoughrum raisin is a bit more interesting just because it takes me back to my childhood and being given tastes of my dads rum and raisin ice cream and being told that i could possibly get drunk as a result i didnt and i didnt here either but it tastes goodthe japanese love cherry blossoms  the sakura  and who can blame them because when spring arrives the country is absolutely covered in them so it isnt a surprise that theres a celebratory kit kat which mixes together green tea with a hint of cherry its fine if you like green tea because thats the dominant flavour here im not a huge fanbeniimo is a japanese purple sweet potato and it definitely wins the prize for being the prettiest kit kat here it has more than a touch of fruitiness to it and most people would find it hard to identify it as being sweet potato more interesting than tastyhojicha roasted tea is the most surprising in the bunch because it completely lacks subtlety it tastes of the strongest cup of tea youve ever had in your life with another layer of flavour because of the roasted element and better still the filling in the wafers gives just a touch of creaminess which adds the right amount of smoothness surprisingly goodwasabi kit kats are just plain weird theres absolutely no mistaking the familiar scent of wasabi once the foil wrapper was opened but the taste is where the real weirdness begins because it changes from sweet to savoury again and again theres no real heat but theres still lots of wasabi flavour it really has to be tasted to be believed but it isnt something i need to ever eat again everthe king of the japanese kit kats however is hot japanese chili first of all it is the only one here which is covered in dark chocolate making it more like your usual run of the mill kit kat but hidden within is some rather spicy hotness that makes it all worthwhile it takes a while to really get going but when it does it gets surprisingly fierce and sticks around at the back of your throat for a while if only all kit kats were this deliciousso very cool who would ever think there would be an entire store devoted to exotic kitkat flavours the dark chocolate hot japanese chili definitely sounds like one that i would enjoy thx for telling us about the chocolatory will have to get me there at some point in time
im very happy that the people at vivani didnt go with any of those dubious health claims for their vollmilch waldbeer crunchy bar after all just adding some granola to a bar of chocolate isnt going to turn it into some kind of superfood but thats basically what this is   organic milk chocolate with wild berry granola mixed through it  leaves a lot of room for the raw cane sugar the first item on the ingredient list and that translates into a rather sweet bar of chocolate those who like theirs dark and rich should stay awayim not quite sure why i was surprised that this tasted so much of granola but i was the little clusters of oat flakes really dominate with the blueberries and raspberries charging to the front of the pack too but what i wasnt ready for was the texture adding all that stuff to the chocolate makes for a very cluttered bar plus it goes beyond the crunchy thats promised on the box by the end of each square theres a grittiness left behind just like when eating a big bowl of granola and i really really didnt like that at all thats a shame really because the chocolate itself looks so good i wonder if i could find vivani in the ukit does look good doesnt it  you can certainly find it in the uk  its available on amazon and somewhere like whole foods may have it
first up is a box of four goose eggs  three of which are made from hotel chocolats high cacao white chocolate one flavoured with strawberry and the fourth is made from their caramel chocolate which seems to be getting into a lot of this years easter eggsnot being the greatest fan of either white chocolate or strawberry i confess i had a few problems getting into these but as ever i had a selection of brave volunteers who were willing to endure a few mouthfuls on my behalf and while a hardened dark chocolate fan like myself might not go for these they dont fail to deliver what they promise if youre going to eat white chocolate you may as well go for something proper and these eggs do have a lot of flavour as well as the inevitable sweetness the caramel chocolate egg has that added richness to it but the size of the eggs means that youre never going to overindulgethe eggs themselves are very pretty the scattering of vanilla seeds on the surface of the eggs gives them an interesting look and this seasons choice of pastel shades works really well with the colour scheme of the packagingfinally we have something a little more lighthearted  a splat egg hotel chocolat would like us to believe that theres been an eggsplosion in their factory and as you can see this means that an otherwise plain caramel milk chocolate egg has been hit with a large blob of pale yellow vanilla white chocolate whats surprising here is that the white chocolate has  more cacao than the caramel milk chocolatenow im not sure a hollow egg is the best idea for a main egg i remember being quite disappointed by hollow eggs as a child but i was always a bit of a greedy guts but if you sit these alongside most companies hollow egg offerings the  hotel chocolat range knocks spots or should that be splats off the opposition for a start theyre very attractive the choice of pastel colours has a brand new retro feel and the quality of the chocolate is still way above most of what youll find on supermarket shelves so if youre contemplating an easter egg hunt of your own this week why not pop into one of hotel chocolats numerous high street stores and have a look at these for yourselfalternatively theres still time to pick up a last minute gift online link below with last orders at pm on april thcomments are closed
contained within an old fashioned style egg box are  mini eggs each filled with flavoured caramelthere are three flavours in all kalamansi lime passion fruit  rosemary and mandarin  tonka beanrococos head chocolatier barry johnson has become known for these zingy flavoured caramels since taking on the role a couple of years ago theyre a firm favourite of mine both for their flavour and texture i particularly love the kalamansi but they are all fantasticthe kalamansi caramel is deliciously citrus while the mandarin  tonka is more subtle but with a gentle warmin effect from the tonka bean the passing fruit  rosemary falls somewhere between the two with a gentle fruitiness with a twist of a hint of rosemarybut perhaps one of the best things about this little box is that each egg is actually two distinct chocolates that means that this little box actually contains  top quality chocolates  its not just a quality alternative to a traditional easter egg but its one of those rare easter chocolates where you actually get more than you might think inside the box might seem expensive for what is quite a small box but this is really one of those cases where youre paying for quality chocolate rather than packaging they make an understated easter gift thats packed with flavour  something much more special than a simple hollow eggcomments are closed
its a tough jobbryan graham and his team make some of my all time favourite bars their  dark milk with fleur de sel is to die for but they also produce a range of confectionery products with their chocolatethey may not look like much but they are one of the most addictive chocolate snacks ive ever tasted the corn nuts are small and intensely crunchy with the flavour popcorn theres a hint of salt and a gentle heat to them that builds as you munch on them but they are never too hot and never too salty and work fantastically well with the  dark chocolate that theyre rolled inthe balance of flavour texture and heat works perfectly and results in a snack thats almost impossible to put down its a simple snack made with quality ingredients  including some of the best chocolate in the worldfruition do sell online but currently only ship to the us but if cocoa runners ever expand beyond bars you can bet this will be one of the first products our list in the mean time these are worth visiting upstate new york forcomments are closed
each of these egglets is made from  cacao white chocolate and each has a different centre theres caramel yellow praline blue and raspberry ganache pink quite grown up flavours for something that has such a lighthearted look about it the caramel is soft unctuous and rich and the praline is a delight and while the sweet tartness of the raspberry ganache was my least favourite that really was a matter of personal tastethe nest is another matter entirely i have handled novelty ashtrays that are less solid than this little beast its impossible to get into it without the aid of implements such is its thickness i ended up having at it with a very sharp knife and it was well worth the effortit was a hotel chocolat  cacao milk chocolate that really changed my mind about high cacao milk chocolate and even an ardent dark chocolate fan like myself had very little problem tucking into a second chunki found myself liking the way this was put together as well the packaging and content work well together and i almost found it nostalgic whichever way you look at it its a well presented well made easter novelty from an accessible quality chocolatier and one i would recommend but be aware that sharing it might be difficult  best buy one eachvery nice dessertif you want to try the best chocolates the swiss imported chocolates online shop has the worlds largest selection of imported chocolates with  free shipping worldwide
there are three varieties blueberry strawberry and hazelnut the fruit varieties are both made with whole freeze dried fruit covered in dark chocolate the hazelnuts are caramelised whole before being covered in chocolatethey are all absolutely amazing i literally cant get enough of themlets start with the blueberries theyre small intensely fruity crunchy and moreish being small you cant just eat one at a time but i found myself taking more and more with each mouthful theyre packed with flavour and a delicious crunchthe chocolate is listed as dark madagascan and  but i think that might be  of the total weight but thats not entirely clear i can say that it is perfectly matched to the fruit  nuts in all three of these products being neither too rich or too sweet the strawberries are a bit mad whole fullsized freeze dried strawberries they have the same crunch as the blueberries but obviously theyre a lot bigger so not quite as easy to eat theyre still delicious and still packed full of fruit flavour thoughand then theres the hazelnuts im not a big fan of hazelnuts but these are just amazing the nuts have been caramelised before being coated in chocolate so they have a similar delicious crunch to the fruits the caramelisation has given them the perfect level of sweetness to balance the chocolate and the result is something thats nigh on impossible to stop eatingcomments are closed
the lack of a decent dairy free milk chocolate option has long been a problem for many people sure they can just have dark chocolate but if youre lactose intolerant  or just cant eat dairy for some other reason  youre a bit stuck for something sweet and creamyso for this review im really looking at two different things how good is it as a milk chocolate and how good an alternative is is for people who cant eat dairy at allthis is a g bar that follows artisan du chocolats standard design a thin but fullsized looking bar its nice looking but it does feel a little light being only half the weight of similarly sized chocolate bars when you open the pack youre greeted with a noticeably nutty aroma with a hint of creaminess in fact even though its a healthy  cocoa solids the nuttiness comes through stronger than the chocolate its unusual but certainly not unpleasantthe texture is quite soft but break a piece off and it has a nice melt and an interesting flavour its quite sweet and unexpectedly creamy for a dairy free chocolate but that almond nuttiness is still very prominent after getting used to the flavour i quite enjoyed it although its not something that would ever replace a quality milk chocolate for meafter having eaten a few chunks i handed the bar to my lactose intolerant friend she has always had the problem of being a milk chocolate fan who cant really eat milk chocolate and while she can get away with small pieces she tells me that even that makes her throat ticklish and uncomfortableand that was the biggest difference for her  she can eat this chocolate without any of the uncomfortable side effects of milk chocolate but more than that she particularly enjoyed the flavour shes uses almond milk every day so it was a very familiar flavour her and one that she clearly enjoyedso there you have it as a milk chocolate it can just about hold its own but for someone who cant eat dairy but still wants something as creamy and sweet as milk chocolate its a great alternativeinteresting would love to try it the pramil dairy free milk chocolate is really good too theres rice powder in place of milk and quite a lot of sugar but is quite scrummy
heres a little piece of swiss confectionery that i picked up in praguenow i wouldnt normally buy swiss confectionery but there was something about this particular creation that caught my eye something in the name  frey chocobloc orange  seemed familiar  i was drawn to itbreak a piece off and youll find its quite tobleronelike on the inside too the thick milk chocolate is filled with thick pieces of almond honey nougat that taste almost exactly the same as their toblerone counterpartsin fact the only real difference flavourwise is the addition of orange flavouring to the milk chocolateand if you want to know what they tastes like simply imagine a stray terrys chocolate orange had accidentally found itself in the collider along with those two bars of toblerone its exactly the same kind of fake orange flavour  although looking at the ingredients it is actually described as orange juice powder so it may have seen a real orange at some point in its lifeas you might expect its sweet confectionery chocolate and not particularly great at  cocoa solids its still got about  more cocoa in it than the likes of dairy milk but thats not saying a lot reallyi did  eventually  consume the whole of this g bar and as cheap confectionery goes it does the job of fulfilling a sugar craving quite effectively but its not something id buy againnow if youll excuse me im just off to consult my lawyers about that namefrey is one of the most popular chocolate brands in switzerland the number one seller too i believe so ive always found it strange that its not widely available in the uk  i know its from the lower end of the market but ive always enjoyed their chocolate bars there are quite a few varieties in the chocobloc range and i especially like the chocobloc air which is an aerated nougat chocolate  basically a cross between a toblerone and a wispa
it might seem like were barely into the new year but easter is just around the corner and that can only mean one thing chocolatehis name is dannyhes pitched as a city worker bunny who works hard and plays hard and has a bit of a thing for the movie grease yes hotel chocolat have created an entire back story for this little characterits almost a shame to kill him but needs mustdanny is was a great looking rabbit i love the simple clear plastic box that hes packaged in you get to see exactly what youre buying which is always a plus point when buying easter chocolatethe chocolate is better than your average easter egg too sure its a simple  milk chocolate but its chocolate and creamy and very pleasant its not a fancy single origin chocolate and there are no exotic flavours but hotel chocolat tell me that many consumers still find those things a bit confusing when it comes to seasonal products like thisso there you have it a simple but very well presented easter bunny at just  i think this is the perfect small easter gift and a thousand times better than your average cadburynestlmars egg thats packed with sugar and vegetable fatscomments are closed
i wasnt quite sure what i was holding in my hands because i know that lots of people play around with chocolate and meat and so i assumed that that was what this was after all it is packaged to look just like a salami right down to the string netting around it and the painting of a surprisingly happy pig on the labelit turns out that the pig is happy because theres nothing porcine in the salami  just chocolate and other sweet things those include candied orange peel sun dried cherries feuilletine pieces coconut almonds hazelnuts nibs and a healthy splash of rum all of which go to create one of the best smelling things that has ever come out of the soma kitchenthe aroma is the absolute embodiment of the festive season  spices and fruit and booze and chocolate i want to have one just to sniff whenever i feel sad because it makes me smile unwrapped it still accurately mimics a salami with its light glazing but cutting into it reveals something which looks a lot like a black pudding  kind of crumbly and speckled with lots of different bits and pieces scattered throughout the salamisurprisingly it doesnt taste nearly as boozy as it smells the rum lurks in the background giving a touch of warmth that lingers but it doesnt dominate instead it is the chocolate and spices that take the lead with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg the texture is a little unusual because there is so much stuff in there although when it comes down to it it is like a really big truffle with a bit of crunch and chewinessit is very rich though and it isnt easy to eat much in one sitting for that reason but as a fun unusual piece of social chocolate to share it is hard to think of anything better because this chocolate salami is a real delicious conversation starter but since this is a seasonal item for soma youll have to wait until december to pick one up so be patientmy mom does something like this at home with biscuit pieces turkish delight raisins rum walnuts and coconutthat sounds amazing can i come over for dinner it sounds nice but doesnt look niceit reminds me of this chocolate covered banana which truly looks grosshttpsweetsfortreatscomproductchocolatechocbananas
while i was in paris recently i thought it was only appropriate that i treat myself to some typically french artisan chocolatesbut i bought these insteadthere is a method in my madness its been so long since ive had a mass produced chocolate assortment that i wanted to see just how much my tastes had changed  and whether the likes of lindt have improved with the rise of the artisan chocolatierwhile i have to admit i quite like the design on the front of the box open it up and its a different story inside the chocolates are pressed into a very cheap and flimsy looking gold plastic traytheres a variety of pralines caramel and ganache fillings theyre all passable but quite bland and a little oily the caramel in particular was more of a flavourless sweet gloop but at only  euros for  chocolates with a shelf life of a year i guess thats to be expectedmy advice always avoid chocolate thats targeted at tourists even if its just a gift im sure the recipient would much rather have a smaller box of fresh handmade chocolates and theres plenty of those to choose from in parisi had no clue this still existed i got a bigger box the one in the video i believe with more types of chocolates more than ten almost five years ago i remember my favourite being the lemon meringue and liking the caramel velours caramel i believe thats what they called it and the almond  cocoa nibs caraica lait chocolates but nothing else was memorable prudent chocolates the kind trying not to offend anyone by avoiding to go beyond the classic nuts or caramel combinations
strawberry jelly layere with rhubarb and white chocolate ganache in a milk chocolate square a tangy and sweet filling thats well matched to the milk chocolate with the slightly tart strawberry helping to cut through the sweetnessblackberry pure and dark chocolate ganache infused with star anise in a dark chocolate square a rich and fruity dark ganache with a smooth texture and just a hint of anisecrushed lemon pure and violet white chocolate ganache in a milk chocolate heart sweet but zingy the lemon overpowers any trace of violet for me but thats quite ok not the most sophisticated chocolate in the selection but one thats packed full of flavoura lychee rose  raspberry dark chocolate ganache in a dark chocolate form more lychee and rose than raspberry this dark ganache is another rich and intense experienceoverall a simple and elegant little box of ganaches that are great for those who love fruity flavours and want something a little more sophisticated theyre packed with flavour and make the perfect simple gift for valentines daywhat an undersell  the lychee rose  raspberry is an award winning chocolate and one of my favourites  i cannot live without it  the sweetness of the rose and lychee is contrasted with the bitterness of the raspberry  the flavours blend together superbly  the chocolate is full of flavour and one bit is enough to give a wonderful rich taste  i agree with your comments on the lemon and violet it is not one that i usually buy  however although there is a strong lemon taste all of the rococo flavours taste natural and the lemon is not as intense as the lemon flavour green and black bar which has a very strong punch to it
the packaging is lovely it has a rustic feel to it with its spidery script and monochrome illustrations and has a lot of information inside about where the chocolate comes from theres even a little certificate of authenticity that states the bar is made with  arriba cacao from ecuador  im not sure it would stand up in a court of law but it is a nice touch i must admit that by the time id perused the whole package i was actually genuinely excited to taste the chocolate and it really didnt disappoint comments are closed
even if you dont speak german youll probably have no trouble figuring out what das exquisite apfel strudel isthe chocolate is pleasant if not out of this world and the filling is interestingwhile theres certainly an appley edge to it its more of an apple flavoured confectionery cream with an alcoholic kick rather than something like the puree that i was hoping forits ultimately a little disappointing and a quick glance at the ingredients reveals why it contains hazelnuts cinnamon liqueur rum and calvados but no actual apple the flavour comes purely from the alcohol which is a little disappointingat only  for g i guess it was asking a little much for it to contain real apple as it is its not an unpleasant bar but its really only going to appeal to those who like sweet liqueur chocolates based on looks alone i had high hopes for this bar but with no actual apple other than that in the calvados i cant exactly recommend it as an apple strudel flavour chocolate bar best spend your  euro on something elsecomments are closed
but what actually arrived took me by surprise inside the large outer box protected and snuggled tightly in polystyrene was this rather attractive looking presentation boxfinished in faux leather with stitching tastefully embossed and sealed with a simple magnetic clasp its the kind of box youll want to keep and so frankly are the chocolates insiderather than being mass produced solid chocolates each letter that chocol make is filled with a fresh praline ganache or caramel theres no nasty preservatives just fresh ingredients giving the chocolates a shelf life of about three weeks each letter has its own flavour although with  characters and only  flavours to choose from many are repeated you create your message via a very well designed and fun to use tool on chocols website just type in your message our use the onscreen chocolate keyboard to pick your lettersflavours its very simple to use and of course quite tempting to see what flavours you get by typing rudes wordsif there is a downside its the price combining beautiful presentation with great flavour doesnt come cheap and prices start at  for a single line of text and go up to  for this three line boxbut if you really want to make an impact with a chocolate gift this is a great way to do it it would make a great birthday or valentines gift for someone very special  and theyre certain to keep the box and always be reminded of you you cant say that about a box of cadbury roseswhat a totally cool idea thx for sharing it with usahh where did you find the info on ingredients i hunted around for ages on the website and then gave up
heston blumenthal seems to be putting his name to just about everything lately half the utensils in my kitchen have his name on and im fairly sure its only a matter of time before we see heston toothbrushes shower gel and toilet cleaner mark my wordsbut the first thing that i noticed about this box was that it felt a little cheap it just doesnt have the feel of a high end product to it inside lies a flimsy plastic insert and some quite average looking chocolates a little disappointing all things consideredbut lets move on to the chocolate the flavours area pleasant  dark chocolate square with a soft smooth lemon  bergamot filling the flavours are well balanced if a little strong and i found the chocolate shell a little too thick but generally a very pleasant chocolatea small globe of dark chocolate with a liquid caramel centre i say caramel but this is actually closer to a fruity syrup its very sweet and runny and the flavour is a bit artificial i enjoyed one but it was a little too sweet to want a secondnot really a bfg at all but an intense cherry chocolate with a soft almost liquid filling this has some unusual smoky tobacco flavour notes but its mainly an intense cherry hit and thats fine with mea soft smooth and very pleasant ganache with a classic flavour combination its uncomplicated but my favourite chocolate in the boxa sweet white chocolate square with a praline filling that tasted more like cat food than macadamia to me odd but true and not very niceanother very sweet very liquid caramel the box describes it as subtle yet firey im not sure how that works but to me it just tastes like thyme overall there are some great flavour ideas here theyre ultimately let down by the execution theyre modern without being challenging which is probably the perfect positioning for a waitrose audience but the caramels are universally far too sweet and arent really caramels at all and i really dont know whats going on with the catfoodmacadamia in terms of quality they fall squarely into the supermarket chocolate category rather than the heston chocolate category and thats a bit of a shame especially when you take the  price tag into accounti must confess i tried these and none of them were wonderful  i would prefer a box of quality street  as although they are sweet they are value for money  all of the flavours are very disappointing and the chocolate itself seems inferior and you do not get a good hit from it  waitrose started selling their own brand chocolate bars and their seriously dark bar is amazing and very good value at less than  a bar  i would recommend buying these as opposed to these overhyped and overpriced chocolatesi so wanted to buy some of these but they were so expensive and i didnt think they were worth itthey didnt come down in price either im glad i didnt waste my moneythese are now considerably reduced in my local wait rose and ive bought some for a mothers day gift spent ages steaming the reduced labels off then there were two very sticky labels this man told me to use white spirit or get them off i could always blame the smell on heston
the packaging of this bar has me questioning the message somewhat too it comes in a simple looking thick brown paper pouch that fits well with the back to human message but when it comes down to the detail the important information is missing theres no indication of where the cocoa comes from or to what extent hu have been involved in the production do they make the chocolate from the bean do they even produce the bars themselves with traceability such a vital human issue in the chocolate world its disappointing to me that this information is missing from the packaging and hus website by now of course most of us know that dark chocolate is naturally healthy it doesnt need to be made with special ingredients it just is thankfully hu stop short of making specific health claims which means i can base the rest of this review on flavour alonethe unknown  dark chocolate is rich and chocolatey but has no particularly complex flavour notes but thats ok and it works very well with the bar as a wholeso what we really have here is a simple tasty highend confectionery its something that i would recommend if it werent for the overemphasis on health messaging and the omission of some important detail i am probably not the target market that hu are going for with this bar or any of their food but i still enjoyed itokay i dont want to inspire eantig disorders so is it even worth trying with caleb and luke  i think they need it but i obviously dont want to cause any problems   im fine with not being too rigid or strict with them  but will that just make the yeast stronger because we are only half way killing it  i guess the question is how much flexibility can i have with those two before it backfires and makes their situation worse
naturally im more concerned about whats inside the package and i must admit i was pleasantly surprised i usually find that raw bars lack the depth of flavour that i like in my chocolate but thats where having a flavoured bar helps to compensate the promised spiciness comes from the addition of cinnamon and cayenne  a tried and tested combination  and they are not shy about how much they threw in that translates into a big cinnamony snack across the tastebuds with just a little room for some chocolately undertones and then some peppery heat lingering at the end it is really rather pleasant but there isnt much room for the chocolate amidst the spices so i really cant tell how i feel about it it appears to be up to the task of supporting the boldness of the flavour but thats all i can say comfortably i still ate the whole thing and would happily eat another one or two but next time around id prefer something that gives the chocolate the chance to shine comments are closed
as with all single origin bars theres absolutely no guarantee that the next batch will taste exactly the same and i cant help but think that with a little bit of fine tuning bachelors hall could deliver on that initial promise as it stands it is still a good bar of chocolate but not a great one comments are closed
this one is i assume a recreation of a cadbury picnic with hazelnut feullentine seasalt caramel and raisins all enrobed in thick amedei toscano  chocolate some of my very favourite thingsi have to admit that as a child i was never particularly into the picnic preferring instead a lion bar of a cadbury fuse its probably been  years since i had one so its difficult to say how close to the original this comeswhat i can tell you is that its absolutely deliciouswith a wonderful nutty crunch fruity raisins and sweet carmel with a hint of salt its incredibly satisfying its only the rich intense dark chocolate that reminds you that this isnt something you should be scoffing down in two bites it really does bring back childhood memories but its also a wonderful creation in its own right the balance of flavours and textures work incredibly well if it has one flaw its that its quite small and even if you take your time with it its gone all too quickly and at  a pop its a little more expensive than the originalthat said as a special grownup treat its well worth the price i still regularly buy the bounty bar and ill definitely be buying more of this just as soon as i get my pocket moneynice work on your wall hanging  i hope i can evnleualty take a bonnie hunter class i think i read about the jelly roll  on your blog first so i tried it  i cut my own strips on this one and they were of varying lengths  i used soome fence rail blocks to make it bigger and plan to add another border or two  i want it to bedsized
after much thought i decided the best solution is simply not to write about any bars that cocoa runners stock but to continue to feature other chocolate from some of the wonderful craft chocolate makers we feature theres just too much fantastic chocolate out there that i have to share so without further ado let me introduce one such chocolate pacari fignow admittedly it may not look much its not exactly a the smoothest glossiest looking bar of chocolate in the world but what it lacks in looks it more than makes up for in flavour those holes in the surface are down to this bar being jam packed full of small pieces of fig delicious soft fruity pieces of fig that perfectly complement the chocolatepacari are known for their raw chocolate which is kept below c during the chocolate making process the process gives pacari a distinctive grassy flavour and although this bar isnt marked as raw it still has many of the same flavour characteristics theyre flavours that work wonderfully with the gentle fruitiness of the fig its a fresh delicious chocolate and its very easy to eat the whole bar in one goif theres one tiny downside its that you will find the occasional hard seed in the chocolate but its a small price to pay for something to tastyim a big fan of pacri their chocolate is produced from tree to bar in ecuador meaning the profits stay within the country rather than going to middle men we get better chocolate and the cocoa farmers get a better dealthis particular bar is still quite difficult to get hold of in the uk but im hoping that well see a much wider range on sale here very soon if you do happen to see it on sale i highly recommend picking up a few barscongratulations on  your new gig i cant think of a more joyful job  working for a chocolate company  im going to try this fig chocolate
the company is best known for these kugeln chocolate balls which consist of a thin layer of chocolate and a soft marzipanlike filling they come in many flavours including these two seasonal variations plumrum and eierlikr egg nogthe former has a thin coating of full milk chocolate but theres no cocoa percentage listed on the packaging to be honest though it doesnt really matter as the chocolate is really just there to hold the filling in placethe eierlikr flavour is coated in a dark chocolate but again theres no indication of cocoa content the filling in this one is a little firmer and flavourwise seems a little less alcoholic and the plumrum version but its also a little less interesting and just as sweettheres no doubting these little chocolate domes look fun but theyre really only going to appeal to those with a very sweet tooth and i suspect they only truly appeal to people in germany who have grown up with them and love them but if sweet alcoholic confectionery is your thing you can buy them online via the halloren websitecomments are closed
the salted caramel  unusually coloured blue  has a soft but firm centre with a silky smooth buttery texture the flavour is quite delicate and not too sweet and reminds me of a butterscotch i really enjoyed the simplicity of this chocolate its uncomplicated but delicious and very easy to eatin yellow we have a have a passion fruit ganache with a similar soft smooth filling this time the chocolate features a tangy fruity flavour that works perfectly with the dark chocolate finally in red we have a christmas pudding ganache made with seasonal spices rum and real christmas pudding this is the real festive showpiece of the box the filling is soft and smooth but not as buttery as the caramel of passion fruit but it really does taste like christmas pudding the rum is quite prominent and its quite rich but its the perfect complement to the other chocolatesi really enjoyed this simple delicious and beautifully presented selection theyre a little different from your average festive chocolates  perfect for sharing or simply as a gift for someone specialcomments are closed
i have to admit i do like the packaging of this bar the design is simple and elegant and the box opens to reveal an a gold wrapped bar but its only when you unwrap the foil that you see just how unusual this bar isdespite the colour this is actually a  cocoa butter white chocolate thats a lot more cocoa content than many milk chocolates which is quite surprising for me of course cocoa butter doesnt have much flavour so the dominant flavour is the matcha tea its not quite as stron as it is in the rzsavlgyi bar but its still quite strong and very distinctivebut theres something else going on with the taste too as the chocolate melts youre left with a very noticeable fruity citrus edge its a flavour strong enough that it made me go back to look at the ingredients and sure enough one of the last ingredients is acidifier citric acid lactic acid i dont know if this has purely been added to give the chocolate that fruity edge or if theres some other reason for itim in two minds about it i do actually love the little bit of zing it brings to the bar but i dont think its entirely necessary and im not a fan of unnecessary ingredientsoverall though this is an unusual bar thats worth seeking out particularly if you like green tea i polished off my bar very quickly and id certainly consider buying morehi dom
as the festive season draws ever closer i thought id have a look at some of the slightly cheaper alternatives to the more extravagant christmas collections and what better place to start than the uks favourite budget supermarketthe chocolates themselves are rather pretty the more observant among you will have noticed a lack of any dark chocolates here  something that left me slightly disappointed  but as you can see these are very attractive looking chocstheyre not run of the mill chocolates either within the collection you will find things like a sea buckthorn and cassis white chocolate and a prosecco raspberry ganache as well as a creme brule chocolate which has a rather lovely runny caramel hidden away at its coreive had a sea buckthorn chocolate before from helsinki as i recall but this version definitely scores big on presentation it was always going to be a sweet little thing but the choice of cassis means theres a sharp little fruit hit in there to balance the sugarinessits a similar story with the lady marmalade  white chocolate balanced with raspberry  and the kir royaletheres even a prize winner in there the crunchy dream chocolate won a chocolate of the year award in germany in for me the lack of anything dark in here means id be unlikely to buy these for myself but the reasonably high cacao content of the milk chocolate  and the overall quality and presentation of this  tin of chocolates make them a surefire hit as a gift item or just to have lying around for casual nibbling over christmas definitely worth checking outhello just to let you know ive been making sea buckthorn chocolates for several years and this year it won the deliciouslyorkshire awards i pick the buckthorn straight from our coastline in the chocolate you described it will be the buckthorn giving the sharpness not the cassis buckthorn has such a unique taste i dont understand why youd spoil it by adding the cassis to iti got a box of these from aldi at christmas my gosh the best ive ever had
these little clusters for instance are particulalry moreish made with dried cherry  italian amaretti biscuits covered in  grenadan dark chocolate theyre insanely crunchy and tangy in fact theyre almost more biscuit than they are chocolatewhat i like best about them is that theyre not too sweet the  chocolate is the perfect counterpoint to the slightly sour cherry so despite being quite difficult to stop eating they never get sickly and you always want just one more with the help of a friend i managed to demolish this g bag in no time at all theyre the perfect stocking filler this christmas  but that could be said for just about everything chococo makecomments are closed
it was almost purely by chance hat i came across booja boojas stand at the speciality  fine food fair in london i was doing my usual long meandering walk out when i spied their logo and went over to see what had been happening in boojaland latelywhich flavours i hear you crya whimsical medley of meltinthemouth melty truffles and quirky puddingy delights thats whatwhich means you ask your screenit means rhubarb  vanilla fool one of the new flavours i sampled at sfff hazelnut banoffee toffee and almond caramelevery one of these truffles is physically identical dusted with bitter cocoa powder with a thin shell and a melting delicate middle flavourwise they couldnt be more differentthe rhubarb  vanilla fool takes that smooth soft melting chocolate and adds vanilla to make it extra smooth then spikes it with zingy supersharp little hits of rhubarb its he sort of chocolate that makes me smile when i taste it and that sharp acidity works as an excellent palate cleanser although to be honest having tasted one i more or less immediately wanted a secondof the four the hazelnut truffle sounded the least exciting hazelnut truffle  big wow right wrong these organic hazelnuts are really something special and in combination with the soft rich chocolate they put me in mind of a good italian giandujathe banoffee toffee truffle is i suppose a cousin of the flambed banana truffle i first reviewed but in reality its a less boozy more puddingy affair theres a slightly darker burnt sugar undertone to the toffee which precedes the lingering but thankfully still subtle and well balanced banana another winnerfinally the almond caramel this is the one youre going to want to hide seriously at the heart of this rich nutty little beast are fragments of as described chewy gooey caramel so as the chocolate melts away you suddenly find you have some seriously rich very naughty caramel to toy with if you know anyone  anyone  with a dairy or gluten problem who is probably fed up with not being able to eat proper chocolate buy them a box of these theyll love you foreverif you know anyone who likes rich gooey deliciously naughty chocolate truffles with a great pedigree buy them a box of these theyll love you forever as well i just wish they made bigger boxes
the signature christmas collection is hotel chocolats grandest selection of exceptional christmas chocolates nineteen yes im afraid theres at least one argument in there very festive looking seasonally themed chocolates which are as one might expect in turn boozy spicy fruity and indulgentthe majority of the chocolates are duplicated but there are three that only appear once including the centrepiece which is a praline pistachio crunch im happy to report that it tastes as good if not better than it looks the addition of cherry pieces and a hint of rose to the praline really does take this up to the next level creamy rich praline which exudes light sweet fruit and rose flavours sat in a rich milk chocolate cup its a bit like the best turkish delight youve ever had only betteralso worth a mention is the christmas mess dark ordinarily a cranberry ganache with strawberry mousse wouldnt really arouse my interest but the balance of flavours between the sweet strawberry and sharper cranberry is superb and putting the whole thing into a surprisingly deep dark chocolate cup makes the whole taste experience very grown up and very enjoyablethe other two single chocolates are a hacienda iara dark salted caramel get in there quick and a  milk ganache the rest of the box contains some very imaginative combinations which make great use of christmassy flavours ports marzipans spices and fruits are all used to great effect the only chocolate i had any sort of problem with was the nutmeg  almond praline the filling seemed to be somewhat at odds with the chocolate but i am not a fan of nutmeg at the best of times so that is obviously just a personal thingits also worth noting that these are not small chocolates the two star shaped chocolates are particularly impressive but none of them could be described as a quick mouthful theyre designed to be enjoyed slowly and savoured like all premium chocolateoverall i would recommend this to anyone looking for something seasonal and indulgent it might not be the cheapest box of chocolates youll find but i believe it represents good value considering the quality of the ingredients and the size of each piece i wouldnt expect the box to last too long thoughthis sounds like a great christmas gift i was thinking of giving my mom a chocolateofthemonth club subscription in a similar vein  more unusual flavors i was looking at templa chocolate tastings  have you tried them or know anything about themecigexpress hotel chocolat signature christmas collection chocolate review
what sets aneesh part though is his distinctive style of water ganache based chocolates where most chocolate ganaches are made with cream aneesh uses water thats more difficult to do because chocolate and water dont naturally mix well but when done properly you end up with a chocolate that puts flavour front and centre with no cream butter or preservatives to get in the way you get to taste more of the natural flavours in the chocolatei caught up with aneesh at the bbc good food show a couple of weeks ago and he gave me a few chocolates to try theyre all quite small round and distinctively finished with flecks of colour as you can see they are all quite similar looking and i made the mistake of not writing down the chocolates i was given but with a bit of detective work i think ive managed to identify themheres some of the standouts from my selectionthis is an interesting take on the salted caramel that has the texture of a ganache but the flavour of a caramel its sweet yet subtle and light very temptinga deliciously warming chocolate thats christmassy and citrussy with just the right amount of cloveanother warming ganache this time in a white chocolate shell the soft smooth centre has a great flavour balance again its not too sweet not too spicyas the name suggests this one is a bit unusual and packs a bit of a punch its tangy intense and works really rather well certainly not one for those who love subtle flavours but i enjoyed itthis chocolate looks innocuous and when you pop it in to your mouth the first flavour is a rather citrus but pleasant citrus note then the chilli hits you and its pretty intense  certainly one of the strongest chilli chocolates ive had lately a little too much for me but proves the theory that aneesh isnt one to do things by halvesoverall i really like aneeshs chocolates hes not shy with flavour and that does mean that they wont all to be everyones taste but i think thats a good thing i love the texture of the ganaches  theyre soft and light and the size of the chocolates is just right comments are closed
it is a lovely looking bar  a rich mahogany shade with a wonderful sheen and a design which mirrors the design on the packaging the chocolate snaps nice and cleanly and the texture is incredibly smooth from a purely technical side theres a lot to be impressed about and thats without even considering the flavour simply put yum theres a lot going on here with the typical fruity and berry notes from the region which slowly retreat leaving hints of lemon and the merest suggestion of ginger the balance of flavours is really great because it doesnt taste sweet even though it is merely  and the added vanilla simply smooths out any rough edges without treading on anyones toes really really good stuff based on this im kind of kicking myself for not trying some michel cluizel chocolate sooner it is easily the equal of valrhonas manjari bar which is the archetypal madagascar chocolate and that is high praise indeed search this one out  you wont be disappointedi just got this chocolate bar for christmas  i was going to save it but your review makes me want to eat it right now  ive had it a few times before and when i think of michel cluizel chocolate i always think of the mangaro bar  you definitely should try more of michel cluizels chocolatei havent found a chocolate in that brand that i dont like yet
they get their name from the bee design on the moulds which in turn comes from a design book rococos chantal coady found when starting the company  years ago rococo have made these bars for a while but theyve just updated the packaging based on the moroccan tiles in the motcomb street garden and introduced these two new flavoursthe raspberry fizz is a  white chocolate with freeze dried raspberries and popping candy i dont eat a lot of white chocolate but thankfully this one isnt too sweet  and given these bars are only g a piece its never going to get too sicklythe pieces of freeze dried fruit also help cut through the sweetness a little although being a fan of raspberries i did think it could have done with a little more the popping candy just brings a gentle fizz to proceedings it doesnt exactly explode in your mouth unfortunately but its fun and satisfies a sugar gravingthe honeycomb crunch bar is a simple  milk chocolate with pieces of honeycomb that as the name suggest add a bit of a crunch again its fairly sweet but i have to confess this little bar was gone in a matter of seconds and i really quite enjoyed itthese rococo bee bars are the perfect afternoon pickmeup to carry around in your bag and despite being simple tiny bars i do have a bit of a soft spot for them you can pick them up in rococos shops in london and chester and im sure theyll also be available to buy online very sooncomments are closed
the company was started after the london olympics but parent company devnaa have been making chocolates since  the couverture used is callebaut so my real interest was in the filling and flavourdescribed as smooth milk chocolate truffles infused with fragrant earl grey tea these are certainly fragrant as i raised one to my mouth i was immediately hit with the bergamot scent of the earl grey tea it was subtle and sweet and suggested that the flavours contained within this little ball were not going to be backwards in coming forwardsas i bit down through the thick milk chocolate shell the sweet flavours of the truffle centre came bursting out flooding my mouth with a mixture of sweet and aromatic flavours happily the earl grey was well balanced and never overpowering as bergamot can sometimes be theres a lot of sweetness there though possibly a little too much for my tastes but im known for not really having that much of a sweet tooth anymore the salt  vinegar truffles looked like they were going to be a bit more to my taste a dark chocolate shell lightly sprinkled with sea salt and a white ganache containing balsamic vinegar seemed much more like the sort of thing i would likethese darker truffles were considerably less in your face than their milkier counterparts with just a hint of chocolate aroma the small amount of sea salt visible on the shell was another encouraging sign and my first bite into the shell had that lovely sweetsalt combination going on when it came to the filling though i found myself wondering where the vinegar was its a slightly sweet very light ganache but it just seemed to lack the necessary bite to justify the nametheres no information about cacao content on the packaging and i suspect that the couverture used is a fairly standard  milk and  darkthe shock came when i went to their website for pricing information at almost a pound a piece these chocolates can only be described as overpriced there are much much better chocolates to be had for similar or even less money which makes these a triumph of style over content i have a feeling that unless the london chocolate company lower their retail prices or up the quality of their chocolates theyre never going to be much more than a tourist souvenircomments are closed
this however was not especially festive so in order to stop myself from directly referring to christmas in early november i thought id ease my way in with a look at this bche barthere is a more festive cherry kirsch  hazelnut bche available but we were given this triplechocolategianduja layered coffee version and as any regular readers may guess i did have my doubts im not entirely sure exactly how many coffeechocolate variations ive tasted over the past few years but i do know that there havent been that many and for a good reason it would seem that coffee and chocolate while perfectly good bedfellows arent always that easy to put together in bartruffleblock form memories spring to mind of the dreadful coffee creams rattling about in the bottom of a tine of roses or sniffed out and sneakily replaced in a bag of revelsof course times have changed and the world of chocolate is a brighter and better place these days so i left my preconceptions in a corner and sat down for a taste youd be right in thinking that something designed for slicing and sharing would be easy to cut through  the knife glides through his bche like it would through a block of pte revealing the three strata which get darker as one goes down through them theres also an added surprise in the form of feuilletine scattered through the cappuccino layer adding a delicate crunch to the middle layer a very good idea given that were talking a triplehit of gianduja here these bche bars are meant to be left lying about so that you and your guests can casually lop a piece off as the fancy takes you i left mine lying around and managed to get through it in a couple of days with very little in the way of help and at  a bar it might be wise to hang back until the festive season although i would imagine one of these and a round of top notch espresso coffees would finish off a dinner party very nicely indeedim a chocolate fanatics and your blog is great for me to find out more about chocolates by just looking at the pictures i can feel the burst of desire for me to grab one for myself chocolates are really awesome
oh and the beryls song i cant recall ever having visited a chocolate makers website and being treated to the company song before in this case a woman singing over a little light jazz piano while voiceover man lists some of the products on offer and was mildly disappointed to find that there wasnt a japanese version of the song on the japanese version of their sitethis little box of black bitter miniature slabs is a strange creature inside the cardboard box is a foil sealed plastic tray  apparently a favoured packaging method in malaysia  which is home to g of chocolate the listed ingredients are given as dark chocolate  followed by a breakdown of ingredients but no mention of actual final cacao content which is mildly annoyingover the course of several years traveling hither and yon it has become apparent that the far east and middle east still have a way to go before they catch up in terms of producing fine chocolate i do have another beryls offering on hand  i just hope its better than this effortsound great after reading the article i want to taste the choco
despite having come across some bars of ambriel chocolate before they arent the best known of companies and their generic packaging doesnt give much in the way of clues either the chocolate in made in switzerland and is organic fair trade and all the other kind of things that make it a regular fixture in all my local health food stores but thats about it nevertheless i found it hard to resist their dark quinoa bar just because it was my first sighting of quinoa and chocolate together in a bar did that stop me from eating the whole thing well no it didnt and thanks for asking and would i pick it up again probably not  the novelty of the quinoa wears off by the midway point and then theres just the unmemorable chocolate left to deal withhi i love food blogs and a friend told me about yours and also cooking with mr c on facebook i just liked his page and came to check you out it looks great i love when people share food blogs with each other  annealter eco have a dark quinoa chocolate too
so whats in the boxan old fashioned liqueur filled chocolate this slow gin liqueur in a dark chocolate shell is deliciously warming and as you might expect fairly alcoholic it brings back memories of the liqueur chocolates we at at christmas as a child only this time done right theres no thick crust of sugar inside and the simple dark chocolate exterior is the perfect balance to the sweetness of the fillinga walnut  fruit marizpan with orange ganache covered in dark chocolate i love the texture of this chocolate as much as the flavour its got a pralinelike crunch to it with a hint of orange and marzipan possibly a little too complicated but delicious nonethelessa layer of apricot jelly and another of lavender ganache in milk chocolate i wouldnt have thought to put apricot  lavender together but it works really quite well its fruity but with a gentle spice and really very nice indeedmy favourite of the bunch apple chocolates are where its at this autumn and this is up there with the best of them deliciously refreshing apple in perfect harmony with warming winter spice in a milk chocolate shell ill certainly be buying more of theseincredibly jealous i think it has all my favourite combinationsoh these sound ace maybe time to revisit rococo
in case you hadnt noticed the nights are getting colder and darker and the leaves are turning this can only mean one thing  its time to start enjoying the occasional mug of steaming hot chocolate silver linings and all thathoweverwhat better place to begin than with their perfectly simple hot chocolate  a  cacaobased drinking chocolate with a sprinkling of sugar and just a touch of nutmeg best break out the posh drinking vesselsim a bit of a cheat when it comes to making hot chocolate i just throw some milk into a jug  microwave it until almost boiling make a paste with the drinking chocolate  some cold milk then add hot milk stir it through and then put the whole lot back into the jug give it another gentle heat through and attack it with a whisk for a minute for frothy light drinking chocolate doneat just under  for a wee box that makes two mugs its not the cheapest drinking chocolate but thats definitely reflected in the taste and of your money isnt being spent on sugarits still cheaper than buying an overly sweet hot chocolate from the high street coffee shops toothis sounds great the stuff you get in cafes and restaurants even the high end places is usually very disappointing and expensive  is not bad considering
cupuau the fruit of the theobroma grandiflorum is something ive wanted to try for a long time its a close relative of theobroma cacao the cocoa tree and produces a similar looking fruit thats filled with a white pulpthe filling is  cupuau combined with fresh cream and honey and that honey was the first flavour i picked up when i first heard about these truffles i was told they were a grandiflorum truffle with no actual chocolate at all so i was initially a little disappointed to discover the other flavours and that theyre covered in a thin layer of  dark chocolateluckily though its a very thin layer of dark chocolate and is probably there to keep the the soft smooth filling in place as much as anything its a very nice chocolate but it does make it a little more difficult to pick up on the actual flavour of the cupuau itselfbut let it melt slowly and the other flavours start to come to the front its vaguely chocolatey quite floral and has some very interesting tropical fruit notes there are hints of pineapple and a noticeable grapefruit note in the finish its really very nice indeedid still like to taste the unadulterated cupuau but marc is a fantastic chocolatier so im certain the other flavours are there for a reason recommended for anyone who wants to understand a little more about cacao and its relatives but even more so for those who just want to try an unusual and flavourful trufflecomments are closed
i have to admit i find the concept and packaging quite appealing unfortunately the cute wrappers are the best thing about these awful vile tasting sweets lets start with the magnuma simple magnum ice cream on a sunny day is still one of my guilty pleasures it may be mass produced but a magnum ice cream feels like a quality indulgencethis is not a magnum ice cream as you open the wrapper youre greeted by an oily sweet smell its apparently made from  rainforest alliance certified milk chocolate which is great unfortunately the gloop that takes the place of ice cream completely overpowers it it has a vaguely chewy texture and tastes of sugar and milk thats been left out too long despite the small size i couldnt eat more than a small bitethe cornetto tastes better and actually replicates the experience of opening a real cornetto quite well although it doesnt look much once its openedmy issue with this one is more about the ingredients  and it should be noted you need a microscope to actually read themdont get me wrong i have nothing against sweet confectionery but these particular products seem to just be cashing in on a well known brand using cheap ingredients and lots of additives to give them a long shelf life if you want a magnum or cornetto go and buy the real thing not thesecomments are closed
you can imagine then that i was quite happy when zchocolat got in touch and offered to send a christmas box for review so whats inside the fabric bag this timewell it turns out its not another wooden box this time its a simple but elegant and well made card box with a snow flake on the box and my name on the frontto be perfectly honest i had mixed feelings about the mahogany box anyway it was absolutely beautiful and its a box i still have and use every day but it felt a little over the top for a box of chocolates  even one designed to be a high end giftthis box i like it may be made of card but it still feels like a quality product and did i mention it has my name on the frontinside are two individual boxes each containing  chocolates the actual chocolates are largely unchanged from the box i received last year and to tell you about them individually would take until christmas next year suffice to say they all use the same mould but have their unique identifying number on the top making the flavour easy to pick out from the little book thats includedthe flavours are all typically french there are lots of pralines caramels ganaches and subtle flavours theres nothing wildly experimental just well tried sophisticated flavour combinationssome of the textures are quite firm and there are a few too many nutty chocolates in the collection for my own taste but again thats quite typical of french chocolateswould i buy them as a gift potentially yes but i still think its a gift better suited to those with a sense of style rather than a taste for the finest chocolate the presentation is immaculate and opening the box is sheer joy but if youre gift buying for a true chocolate connoisseur you might still find more interesting chocolates at your local artisan chocolatierbased on my personal experience zchocolatcom is a horrible servicewebsite to use first of all they do not deliver on time and as promised they changed my order shippingdelivery date several time and it was delivered several days later than initial plan surprisingly a few days after the late delivery i received another bill from them for some additional local custom delivery and monitoring fees the original gift chocolate price was roughly  and they had initially charged me  for its delivery the second bill asked for another  for monitoring of the same purchase in other words i was charged  for delivery of a  box of chocolate they have poor customer service and refuse to acknowledge my purchase invoice definitely the chocolates are not that good to worth all these extorted additional deliveryshippinghandling charges i will never do business with them again and recommend all of you to stay away from them
but theyre back with a new single origin bar and they were kind enough to send us a sample to reviewthe chocolate itself is a fairly ordinary looking bar as you might expect from an  chocolate it has a deep rich colour and thats something thats reflected in the tastethe flavour is intense and chocolatey but not especially complex there ares a strong cocoa powder note but its also surprisingly sweet for an  chocolate so its really quite accessible if you imagine a really strong hot chocolate drink but in bar form youll get a good idea of the flavour of this chocolateso despite the lack of complexity i enjoyed this bar its the kind of chocolate you can just keep by your desk at work and break off a chunk every now and then as a pick me up if you need a little intensity in your life but dont care too much for subtle flavour notes then this is worth picking up and remember the more you eat the quicker youll save the planetscrummyhi dom their chocolate is made by bernraini love it im a big fan of this chocolate i tasted it recently in a trade fair but i have to find out where its been sold in barcelona
as you can see its a great looking bar of chocolate valrhona tend to make their chocolate in a variety of different formats depending on the target market these gram bars are clearly aimed at the consumer market and theyve done a really good job with the design both the packaging and the bar feel like a quality productthe milk chocolate is slightly matt in appearance perhaps not as glossy as i would expect but still very well finishedfor a  milk chocolate its surprisingly sweet and creamy if you had to guess blind you might think it was closer to  but its also very well balanced neither the sugar or milk overpower the warm chocolate notes its not a particularly complex chocolate though the tasting notes on the pack claim an essence of nut enhanced by a fruity acidity but i think that may be pushing it a littlewhat you have here is a very enjoyable creamy  comforting milk chocolate that will disappear in no time i am regaining my love for milk chocolate lately
its also not hard to make throw in some water  a tin of tomatoes  it more or less takes care of itself perfect for people in a hurry or lazy cooks the packet even suggests that this soup base would make a decent chilli con carne with the addition of beef and beans versatile tooafter a short period simmering away during which time the soup thickened considerably it was ready to servefirst impressions were good the soup definitely has some chilli warmth to it but it wont blow your head off and the tomatoey sweetcorn and spice flavours are indeed underpinned with hints of that dark chocolate dont get me wrong here it isnt a soup that tastes of chocolate its a soup that uses chocolate as one of a set of ingredients but without the chocolate it would taste quite a bit different what the chocolate does is add a little body to the soup plus a lovely undercurrent of chocolatinessthey say the proof is in the eating and we took care of this soup with a few slices of home made bread in not many minutes at all having read the ingredients id be tempted to make this myself from scratch its not terribly complicated but if you fancy a wee taste of mexico in soup form id recommend tracking this one downtoo much salt for mesounds like i may have to try this or at least find a recipe of my own to follow with less salt 
the plantation range first saw the light of day about twelve years ago and youre unlikely to find them in the uk im afraid mine were bought on a holiday trip but if youre on the continent theres a very good chance theyll be lurking on a supermarket shelf somewhereits a bit of a rare beast in terms of origin we see so much cacao from south america but very little from the caribbean small island producers tend to sell to the higher end more exclusive chocolate makers or in the case of hotel chocolat they just grow for the company i dont recall ever having eaten much trini cacao beforedespite its hefty cacao percentage the chocolate has a surprisingly mild flavour theres no getting away from the distinctive earthy texture and mouth feel that high percentage cacao chocolate has and some people do find that grainy slightly coarse texture offputting but happily this is one of the smoothest highcacao bars ive eaten in a long timethe characteristic graininess of high cacao chocolate is evident to some extent but overall i was very impressed with how smooth and light it was texturally the trinidadian cacao has a good depth of flavour and a long finish overall very impressive and certainly good enough to put trinidadian cacao on my radar  i shall be keeping an eye out for more chocolate made with beans from the islandneed chocolatenowrausch make chocolate under the j d gross label for lidl
there are some foods that are just made to go together fish  chips tea  biscuits marmite  chocolatehere it is in all its gooey glorybut wait i hear you cry how doe marmite work in a browniethats a good question and the answer is very well indeedthe marmite acts just like the salt in a salted caramel and actually enhances the flavour of the chocolate of course the marmite flavour is quite strong and if there were too much it would completely overpower the chocolate but paul has managed to get the balance just right theres enough marmite to get a good hit from it but what you mostly get is the sweet gooey chocolateyness youd expect from a paul a young brownieif you love marmite then i think youll love this too if youre one of the nonconverted who doesnt yet love marmite then i still think its worth trying for novelty value  and because its just a damn good brownielooks wonderfull wish we had it here in portugal 
tazas approach is much closer to early chocolate making the cocoa beans are more coarsely ground sugar and flavours are added its ground a little more and then its done the result is a chocolate with a coarse crumbly texture thats more like a biscuit than the chocolate youre used to  it still tastes like chocolate but the chocolate flavour and sugar are more distinct this particular creation is just  cocoa solids making it much more like a confectionery than a dark chocolatethis cinnamon version is definitely one of my favourites the cinnamon works perfectly with the biscuity texture and sweet taste its a gentle warming flavour rather than something overpoweringly spicy the texture is crumbly and it doesnt melt in the mouth so much as dissolve dont let that put you off though its really rather nice  not to mention addictivebut what i like best about taza chocolate mexicano cinnamon is that it perfectly straddles the line between real bean to bar chocolate and confectionery it has a flavour and texture that will attract kids and grownups alike and with just three ethically sourced ingredients  organic cocoa beans organic cane sugar and organic cinnamon it has the credentials i look for in a real artisan productcomments are closed
im always on the lookout for new british beantobar chocolate makers by my calculations there are currently just nine businesses in the uk making small batch chocolate from the bean commercially ninethats nothing but its still three times what it was a few years ago more and more chocolatiers and chocolate lovers are having a go at making chocolate themselves rather than buying it in and i think were going to see a huge growth over the next few yearsthe bar is very simply wrapped in thin foil and paper theres no attempt to replicate the current fashion of thick wallpaperlike wrapping here its all about the chocolatethe bar has a rich dark red colour with a very glossy finish the moulding is simple but its one of the nicest looking bars ive seen recently that gloss is partly down to a fairly high cocoa butter content and that comes through in the texture its initially very smooth but as the chocolate melts there is some graininess from the less refined cacaothe first flavour that hits you is intensely chocolatey and really rather nice the bar is sweetened with coconut blossom sugar and i think that adds its own flavour to the chocolate too as the chocolate melts though its the raw green and earthy flavours that come to the front unusually for a raw bar theres also a bit of a roasted note in there tooits never bitter but is in quite intense i really quite enjoyed it and the more i had the more i liked it if youve got a sweeter tooth the flavours will probably be quite surprising but i do think this is a chocolate anyone can enjoyim really looking forward to seeing what forever cacao come up with in the future although i dont actively seek out raw chocolate this is a bar that i would be happy to part with cash for i just hope it helps inspire a few more people to having a go at making chocolate from the bean themselvescomments are closed
the packaging is simple but beautiful decorated with a geometric cocoa pod motif with a colour coded label it neither feels too pretentious or too crafty its understated but feels like a quality productthe cocoa pod motif continues to the chocolate itself its a rich deep brown colour with a hint of red  something accentuated by the lighting in my photos here its a g bar with no chunks but its thin enough to break off any size piece you wanttheres a wonderfully fruity aroma to this bar and thats reflected in the flavour its intensely chocolatey with a deep fruitiness and a hint of liquorice the small amount of salt simply enhances those flavour notes without making itself too obviousthe result is a smooth chocolatey experience thats as delicious as it is comforting its more subtle than the menakao milk chocolate and more complex than duffys i just love it and i think you will tooso far i havent seen fruition do anything poorly  i havent had a chance to taste this one yet im sure i wont be disappointed
what it turned out to be first and foremost was incredibly messy unbelievably so and the main reason for the messiness was that this was not a bar of caramel flavoured with coconut but a bar filled with caramel which has its back covered in toasted coconut lots of it just the simple act of eating one square will lead to little piles of coconut all over the place but theres still more than enough to contribute to the flavour of the bar the mess was also down to the fact that my bar had taken a hit at some point and had burst in a couple of places leaking caramel all over the place and that appears to be something that you have to live with then it comes to these bars because even trying to break the pieces apart along the designated lines was kind of difficult so that lead to more leaking basically anticipate a big sticky messbut is it worth itthis is one of those bars that falls into the category of an eating chocolate rather than a savouring chocolate  nothing wrong with that at all after all sometimes you just want to eat some delicious chocolate and this definitely fits the bill plus it is made with all natural ingredients and ethically sourced cocoa beans so it can be eaten in good conscience too just be prepared to clean up afterwards ive seen it now guys seasalt that is its over done please please no more sea salt chocolateget over yourself
so how does the gianduja comparea gianduja is like a milk chocolate thats been conched with ground hazelnut rather than milk powder the result is a soft rich nutty chocolatethe chocolate tree have chosen to use fine  ecuadorian arriba beans in this bar along with  hazelnuts the g pack contains two individually wrapped bars perfect for sharing if youre into that kind of thingas you would expect theres no glossy shine to the bar and the texture is soft but its not so soft that it melts the moment you look at it and its actually moulded rather nicely the flavour is initially rich and chocolatey  much more so than you would usually expect from a  chocolate but the main flavour note here is intense roasted nutty and really rather tasty its not too sweet and not too bitter and very moreish indeed its one of those bars thats quite difficult to stop eating once you startif youve not had a gianduja before this would be a great place to start the balance of chocolate and nuts is just right and its been made with care and attention to detail i personally prefer the chocolate trees dark chocolate bars but with an expanding range they have something for everyonecomments are closed
madagascan chocolates are often intensely fruity so in my mind they work better with dark chocolate that fruitiness can sometimes clash with the creaminess of a milk chocolate this bar also contains a healthy dose of madagascan vanilla and a pinch of salt to enhance the flavour even morethe chocolate has a pleasantly fruity aroma but the first flavour notes that come through are creamy and chocolatey as the chocolate melts though the fruitiness builds to a wonderfully intense level the hint of salt certainly lifts the flavour even higher but also seems to bring it all together the creamy fudginess and intense fruitiness never clash interestingly coming back for a second try at a different time of day i picked up more of the chocolatey and creamy notes and the fruity notes were a little less intense its quite surprising just how different a chocolate can taste at different times of day and this bar illustrates that very wellcomments are closed
about a year ago i was asked to be part of a small group giving feedback on a top secret new product from drinks company diageo it turns out that product was a new chocolate version of baileys and its fair to say that i left thinking the drink we tried a year ago wasnt quite ready for marketbut we didnt actually learn a lot at the event while the drink is made with real chocolate it is  as you might expect  cheap bulk belgian chocolate made from west african beans the fact that it was talked about as though it was the best chocolate money could buy was more than a little frustrating lilys cakes were great and it was nice to see both lily and sam bompass  harry parr themselves doing the talks but there wasnt a lot of substance behind the theatreits rather annoying then that the press release for the baileys drink starts with the lines the world first innovation in chocolate from baileys that sees real belgian chocolate fused with alcohol for the first timeignoring the fact that the horribly outdated words belgian chocolate are being used to signify a quality product that little quote brings me to another issue i have with baileys chocolat luxe they havent really fused the chocolate at all and the moment you add ice to the drink it starts to separate this is something we noticed in development a year ago and although its not quite as bad in the final version it seems diageo have decided to try and make a feature of itas the ice chills the drink a hypnotic pattern emerges on its surface swirling and marbling the rich chocolate liqueur into a lighter ornate rococo designand this is what it actually looks liketo me that looks more like a curdled mess than an ornate rococo design with all that said i dont actually dislike baileys chocolat luxe its actually a very pleasant chocolatey version of baileys and id quite happily drink it occasionally but some of the language imagery and theatre being used to describe it are a little over the top for what it is its not a unique innovation its not a masterpiece of theatrical artistry its just baileys with chocolate in it innitoh i would have loved to go to a product launch event at dennis severs house love that place thanks for your review found it v interesting and educational for the amateur chocolatelover that i am i might buy it if i see it on offer considering your comments prefer the thorntons onei have to say that i think your comments are a little harsh the separation of the colours doesnt look like curdling at all it looks exactly like what happens in normal baileys just more extreme  i checked this when i got home and you should try it for yourselfi really enjoyed it when i tried it and its a ton better than the thorntons one which id only ever use in a mixed drink not on its own i thought that the chocolateyness was really nice and tasted genuine rather than cheap  god knows why youd put an uber premium chocolate in a mass produced drink anyway did you really expect them to do that
its been a long time since i had any supermarket confectionery so i wondered if id still be able to handle itas you might expect it tastes almost entirely of sugar the filling has an odd texture and a bit of a strange aftertaste but its not all bad in actual fact in the midst of my sugar craving i had no trouble eating the entire bar i just felt bad that i had done soif youre really into sweet confectionery youll probably enjoy this its certainly a step up from a twix or mars bar but for my tastes its just too sweetim not sure why divine chose to use such a low cocoa content chocolate on a product thats already packed with sugar as a brand thats working to increase peoples awareness of the ethical issues in the chocolate industry id rather see them aim a bit higher with the quality of their ingredientscomments are closed
and that is what makes their chocolate a superfood in their eyes  the raw criollo beans from peru are high in antioxidants and other nutrients so between that and the sugar this is one of those supposed guiltfree bars iq stop short of making any real health claims but the wrapper talks about this being  intelligent chocolate and the bar itself is embossed with their tagline for real smartiesim more concerned about the taste than anything else though because im not really expecting a bar of chocolate to have magical powers it would be great if it did but im a realist and thats why this wasnt my favourite bar ive had recently although some other people i shared it with were much happier with it some of the other bars from iq have flavours like peppermint or cinnamon and cayenne thrown into the mix and im thinking that might be the extra dimension i personally need but it is wonderful to see more caledonian bean to bar chocolatecomments are closed
tcho prefer to talk about flavour notes rather than origins which is a great way to get people thinking about the natural flavours in chocolate tcho describe this particular bar as having a dreamy fudgy flavor and a smooth creamy finishtrying a small square the first thing i noticed was a quite intense chocolatey hit and a very smooth buttery texture it takes a few seconds for the sweetness and creaminess to come through but when they do you really do get a very pleasant fudgey note the finish is both creamy and chocolatey but never too sweet or too bitter in terms of flavour its not complex its simply a great tasting rich milk chocolate in fact if theres one problem with this chocolate its that its just too easy to eat the whole thing far too quickly its no surprise that it won an international chocolate award for the best americanmade milk chocolate last yeari seem to be going through a bit of a milk chocolate phase at the moment and its great to know that theres such a great choice of quality rich milk chocolates being produced by artisan chocolate makers for milk chocolate fans and dark chocolate lovers alike this is a bar youll want to tryhow funny  this is the bar i stayed up late eating last night and now am awake too early this morning definitely cocoa in there  its a great bar
unwrapping the simple paper band featuring a boy riding a cow reveals the wonderful blackandwhite print box featuring cocoa pods and foliage the bar inside is simply wrapped in wax paper and features a perfectly moulded intricate pattern the experience of opening a rzsavlgyi bar alone makes it worth the asking price and we havent even tasted it yetsomething else that i noticed was that there dont seem to be any salt crystals on the bar itself most salt flavoured bars have the crystals simply sprinkled over the surface as the chocolate is setting in the mould but here they appear to be in the chocolate itselfthe salt is certainly there bite into a piece of the rich smooth  milk chocolate and the tiny salt crystals make themselves known theres the perfect amount of salt to lift the flavour without overpowering the chocolate itself it has complex nutty liquorice notes but its mainly just a delicious milk chocolateit would be very easy to eat a whole bar of this in just a couple of minutes but its worth taking your time with it and savouring every small piece its available from selfridges in london or to buy direct from hungary via the rzsavlgyi websitecomments are closed
the packaging is nice  a simple box with great typography and a small window onto the cellophaneenclosed chocolate inside so you can see what youre getting my only complaint here is that the blurb on the back is written in a cursive font in yellow on pale green and is almost impossible to read unaided i ended up having to take a macro photo and adjust the contrast to make it out maybe im just going blind in my old agewhite chocolate and lemon are a fairly safe combination for confectionery fans theres nothing like a bit of citrus to cut through the intense sweetness of white chocolate but sometimes the combination of tangy fruit and intense creaminess can be a bit jarring getting the balance right is key to a bar like thiskonnerup have also opted to add something a little different to this bar  yoghurt powder and there is a definite yoghurty flavour to it its difficult to know how much of that is from the milk powder and fruit and how much is down to the added yoghurt but the overall effect is something a little nicer than the average flavoured white chocolateof course its only going to appeal to you if you have a sweet tooth and there are many who just wont get on with a flavoured white chocolate at all but even coming from the dark side i found it something i could enjoy albeit in small doses if you love your white chocolate this is something youll want to look out forcan you get this in uk or has to be shipped  that would be priceythis bar sounds amazing i looked the company up and cant find where i can order it in the us and have it shipped may have to have my danish friend send me somei couldnt find it for sale online anywhere this one was bought in nyc by a friend and brought back
that bar is made with cacao from the dominican republic but this earl grey tea chocolate bar is the first time ive reviewed something with beans grown in hawaii itself or if you want to be precise the alae estate in hamakua a district in the north west of hawaiis big islandthe first thing i noticed about the chocolate was that its both incredibly smooth and very sweet for a  cocoa solids bar theres a gentle fruitiness as the chocolate starts to melt and then the tea kicks in its more pronounced than many tea chocolates ive had in the past and although it overwhelms the chocolate a little its really rather nice theres a gently spicy bergamot finish that stays with you for several minutes long enough to remind you that you want another piecethis is the kind of chocolate bar i will happily nibble on through the course of the day rather than one that i covet and love like madres triple cacao bar but for uniqueness of flavour and origin its certainly something worth tryingcomments are closed
the packaging is rather lovely  very thick paper covered in colourful flowers held together with stickers that carry all the details of the bean to bar process for that particular bar it retains that homemade artisan feel that the chocolate tree are so fond of how does it all taste though well the raw bar definitely has some of the classic madagascar fruitiness but without the roasting those flavours are not fully developed and i miss that to me theres something lacking even though there are some other more subtle notes lurking in the background but it isnt for me the other bar is much more to my tastes all the berries and fruits come flooding through immediately and dont let up even after all the chocolate has gone this is a really really good bar of chocolate with lots of depth and is even more impressive considering that it is the result of some of the chocolate trees first bean to bar experiments at  it finds just the right balance between bitterness and sweetness and it is a really easy bar to eat it didnt last long at all good stuff and im really excited to see what comes next from the chocolate treei agree with you both bars are excellent but i definitely preferred the one with the roasted beans its pretty hard to go wrong with cocoa from madagascar
as you might expect each box contains a selection of chocolates around the themes of salted caramel and chillithe boxes carry the distinctive james chocolates pink and purple colour scheme theyre not quite dayglow but youre not going to misplace them easily either inside the boxes the pink theme continuesi was a little disappointed by the internal packaging each of the four tasters is simply sealed in a plastic bag wrapped in pink tissue paper and thrown into the box it does the job of protecting the chocolates but it looks a little thrown together to me i guess that internal packaging is one of the challenges if shipping irregularly shaped chocolatesalso included are salted caramel truffles salted caramel  vanilla beans and cherry salted caramel discsof these the truffles were my favourite despite not being close to a fresh handmade salted caramel from an artisan chocolatier the buttery caramel was pleasant and melted nicely the solid caramel milk chocolate beans are also quite addictive and made more interesting by occasional crunchy salt crystals that reveal themselves as the chocolate melts the dark chocolate discs with dried cherries didnt quite do it for mein the chilli chocolate tasting box we have a similar selection chilli honeycomb raspberry  chilli beans firecracker discs and chipotle chocolate chillies theres quiet a chilli kick to some of the chocolates in this box but i wasnt as much of a fan of it as the salted caramel i found that where the caramel added a little depth to the otherwise quite plain chocolate in this box i just got plain chocolate with heat this might be the kind of chocolate you would take to a party to show off some chocolates with a bit of heat to them but im not convinced theyre the kind of chocolates anyone would buy for themselvescomments are closed
i think it would be a little disrespectful of me not to at least try though so in the interests of learning how to say the name properly ive been acquiring more and more of their wonderful looking chocolate lucky for me then that selfridges in london have recently started stocking it so its now much easier for me to get hold of visiting the store for a tasting with katalin last week i was delighted to find their range extended well beyond the single origin bars ive tasted before the one thing all the products have in common is that they look fantastic these are easily some of the best looking chocolate bars you can buyrather than going for another single origin dark bar i decided to go for something a bit different this time this amazingly coloured bar is actually a white chocolate with green matcha teathis is a bar thats all about personal taste im sure there will be some people that cant get past the colour and i think the flavour will produce a similar reaction this is after all a white chocolate so its inherently sweet but at  cocoa butter it actually has nearly  more cocoa solids than a bar of dairy milk so its actually not too sweet the real story here though is more about the interaction of the matcha tea and the milk solidsfor me eating a small piece of this chocolate is like taking a sip of a sweet green tea with added cream unlike many tea chocolates the flavour is strong and comes right to the front but the creaminess brings the flavour back a little  a bit like adding milk to your every day cup of tea at homethat matcha flavour stays with you long after the chocolate has melted away and thats something i really enjoyed if you dont like that distinctive flavour then this isnt the bar for you  but i would argue that its such a beautiful object you should just go out and buy it anyway you can always send it to mecomments are closed
there are six flavours in the box devon strawberry oxfordshire plum yorkshire rhubard somerset apricot scottish raspberry and cornish sea salt each is a small glossy dome of milk or dark chocolate hand painted with coloured cocoa butter the effect looks great especially seeing all the chocolates together in the boxafter trying a few different chocolates one of the most most noticeable aspects turned out to be the subtle differences in texture between the fruits i would imagine that each of the fruits requires a slightly different method to get the best flavour out and the result is some of the caramels are thick and have texture while others are more runny and perfectly smooth i spent some time trying to pin down a favourite in this box and found it next to impossible the raspberry and strawberry flavours are deliciously jammy while the apricot is more subtle and the rhubarb is delightfully tangy i think the only way im going to be able to pick one is to get another box this one seems to be empty for some reasonseems like the hit the nail on the headi saw these at the harvey nichs xmas preview in the new black box but they didnt have any available to taste sadly 
what is a little surprising is how that flavour combination is achieved chocolate maker alan mcclure has opted to combine peanut butter into the chocolate and let the natural fruit notes in the chocolate supply the jelly  jam flavourtheres no indication of either cocoa percentage or origin on this bar which is a little annoying it may not be aimed at the high end artisan market but it would be nice to have a little more information about what im eatingtheres also no information on how the bar is made but it looks as though the peanut butter has been conched with the chocolate for some time the result is a bar that looks fantastic but lacks the glossy shiny finish you would expect from a dark chocolate bar i have to admit that the matt finish has a beauty of its own thoughthats reflected in the texture too the chocolate does have a bit of a snap to it but its quite soft and very smooth and melts quickly in the mouth dont expect chunks of peanut in this barthe flavour is led by roasted peanuts but with a little too much emphasis on the roasting and not quite enough on the nut for my tastes for the most part it overwhelms the chocolate but towards the end you do get a little hint of fruitiness from the chocolate its not much but its definitely therei really like the concept of this bar but the roasted flavour is just a little too strong for for me i enjoyed it as confectionery but found myself wanting to taste a little more of the chocolate and a little less of the roasted peanuts its certainly a step up from the average peanut chocolate and something worth seeking out for novelty value alone thoughi happened to have one of these bars in my stash so when i read your post i went and got it out so that i could taste along with youi have to agree with you this bar underwhelmed me a disappointment from a chocolate maker of the patrics stature i loved the idea of the bar combining the smoothness of natural peanut butter sea salt and fruity chocolate but it didnt deliver to my expectations there isnt nearly enough nuttiness for my taste and i found the chocolate to be very flat not nearly enough fruity notes oh well
this is a bar thats been around for a while but seems to have new packaging im not sure if that means the recipe has been updated or if the changes are purely aesthetic though in fact its annoyingly difficult to find out any information about this chocolate at allthe bar itself has a slightly lacklustre appearance the moulding is just ok and the tempering is fine but its certainly looks a little less impressive than the paper it came in the chocolate has a nice snap but its slightly softer than i would expect and has a noticeably grainy texture this appears to be from the maple sugar itself but its not easy to tellthe flavour of the bar is both intense and sweet and actually very pleasant its not particularly complex but the maple sugar adds a little flavour of its own that comes through toward the end despite my issues with this bar its one that i found very easy to eat without noticing how quickly it was disappearingoverall though given the cost of mast brothers chocolate  particularly outside the us  and the lack of information on the wrapper its not a bar i would recommendcomments are closed
gustavs bars or should that be slabs are beautifully moulded with the filigree and birds design and come sellophane wrapped in an elegant cardboard sleeve presentation wise everything says high endthe chocolate itself is a slightly different tale thoughits a pretty basic  cacao chocolate comparable with uk commercial chocolate and fairly unremarkable but the addition of lemon salt really saves it that generous sprinkling of crystals transforms this bar from mediocre to almost marvellous as i popped the first piece into my mouth i was unprepared for the taste explosion which followed the initial sweetness of the chocolate was almost immediately joined by the bright lemon of the salt and then the saltiness kicks in to create a maelstrom of flavours  by turns sweet and citrus punctuated by saltiness its a bit of a taste rollercoasterwith a fairly meagre  cacao it could hardly be called fine chocolate which is a real shame because i couldnt help but feel that if gustavs had just gone a little further and sourced some really good cacao and put more of it into this bar then they would have a truly remarkable product on their handsas gustavs are based in latvia i doubt their products are that easy to get hold of in the uk and to be honest the cost of having it sent over from riga probably isnt worth it but if gustavs up their game and source some proper cacao then they really could impresscomments are closed
pacaris bars arent made in fancy moulds they have an elegant simplicity which really shows off the chocolate slit open the foil wrap and slide the bar out and you can see the deep reddishbrown hue of the chocolate sniff it and theres the promise of deep rich flavours with hints of woody overtones red berries and exotic fruit pop a square into your mouth and allow it to melt slowly and those flavours come rushing out to greet your palatewith a good level of acidity to set the mouth watering the flavours of the arriba nacional beans just keep coming however the flavours are a bit of a jumble with earthy dark notes colliding with hints of fruit berries caramel and a touch of roasted coffee it has a good melt but that is due to the amount of cacao butter used the finish is slightly tart and doesnt hold for as long as one might expectcomments are closed
it was all british airways fault thanks to sequence of events which involved airline takeovers and the subsequent lack of flights available to air canada passengers within the uk that meant i ended up in brussels or rather brussels airport i was stuck there between flights back in march and since i wasnt able to sleep i shoppedmost of it was window shopping but it turned out that brussels airport is jampacked with chocolate lots and lots of chocolate a wonderful selection of chocolate both belgian and nonbelgian to be honest it was hard not just to go completely nuts in my sleepdeprived state and fill the remaining space in my suitcase but i showed some restraint and bought what could be best described as a lot of chocolate it is a lovely looking bar of chocolate  nice and shiny with lots of sultanas and whole nuts studded into the back and theres quite a range of nuts too  pecans almonds hazelnuts and pistachios making this a bit more classy than your average fruit and nut bar the chocolate is very rich and buttery but would be a little on the dull side if there wasnt anything else in there to hog the limelight it clocks in at  which leaves a bit too much room for sugar for my tastes but the abundance of nuts does help to compensate for that sweetnesstheres nothing too fancy about this bar but that didnt stop me from finishing it very quickly sometimes you just need to eat some yummy chocolate and this would definitely fit the bill if you want something nutty im not sure id go out of my way to search it out but between this and the other two varieties i sampled id be quite happy if i was diverted through brussels airport againcomments are closed
founded by ben rasmussen in  potomac is a very small artisan operation run out of bens basement but an academy of chocolate award and a successful kickstarter campaign to fund new equipment mean that potomac is a name youre bound to be hearing more ofi want to start with a word about the packaging im a little conflicted about it even when unwrapped its a very simple looking bar  at least until you turn it over the underside is studded with a generous helping of cocoa nibs and some small salt crystalsthe flavour is wonderful deep rich and fruity as the chocolate melts it seems to become sweeter as the more gentle caramel notes come through those naturally sweet notes contrast nicely with the slightly bitter nibs and the whole thing is lifted by the addition of a little salt with the random nib  salt placement every piece is subtly different but equally goodi love this bar in fact by the time i got around to writing about it i only had one small chunk left its the kind of chocolate that can disappear very quicklyits interesting that ben has opted to go for separate nibs  salt bars in future as i think they work very well together in the same bar but i know id love to try the saltonly version  for me the simple flavour enhancement that the salt gives is probably all this chocolate needs but you should probably try the whole range and decide for yourselfthanks for the review dom im glad you enjoyed the bar
this is a tale of two chocolates one good and one less sothe chocolate is in date the moulding is clean and it has a nice snap to it but thats where the good news ends unfortunately the aroma is slightly fruity but astringent and the flavour is horribly bitter i dont know if its an issue with the roasting or something else but its gritty astringent and very difficult to eati cant believe this is by design but how a bar this bad got through any kind of quality control is a mystery to me i didnt manage to eat more than a couple of small pieces of this barmoving on next up we have the house blend  grand cru venezuela the english part of the label helpfully tells me this is blend of maracaibo classificado and sur del lago criollo beans the tasting notes tell me to look out for black berry fruits roasted walnuts and fine cacao aromas out of the box this is a much better looking chocolate its glossy and really quite attractive the marks on the front are simply where the cellophane inner wrapper had stuck to the chocolate slightlythis is the complete opposite of the madagascar bar immediately the roasted notes make themselves known if anything its probably roasted a little too much but i happen to like that flavour as the tasting notes say theres distinct nuttiness to it too although for me its more peanuts than walnuts  something very unusualthis is a very easy to eat bar and such a contrast to the madagascarcomments are closed
the company has been active for five years now but was six years in the making before that andr stengel  the founder  decided to get involved in vietnamese cacao after a somewhat illustrious career as both head of a high school and vp of the french confectioners  chocolatiers association france was the first country to colonise vietnam and the country was producing cacao until the vietnam war disrupted both cultivation  supply vietcacao is also engaged in an ethical and sustainable development programme with the company investing profits back into the local community one particularly notable project involves the installation of equipment and provision of training for pupils in a school for handicapped peoplewith support coming from mainly french companies and chocolatiers vietcacao continues to build on early success in the uk marc demarquette is both a supporter and importer of their products and it was he who supplied this bar for reviewthe chocolate itself is a deep reddish brown in colour with a light vibrant scent suggesting fruityfloral notes which is borne out in the tasting good acidity and lots of bright fruity cacao notes precede the deeper red fruits and woodier low notes it has a long clean finish and an excellent soft mouthfeel at seventy percent cacao this bar doesnt overwhelm in any way  its a light bright tangy chocolate with a great range of flavours i suppose one way to describe this bar would be unsurprising which is in no way an insult it has all the right qualities for a good chocolate but doesnt surprise in anyway you get bright lively acidity sitting over moderate dark notes a hint of bitterness and a long clean finish and thats all goodits good to see someone taking the time and trouble to resurrect the cacao growing industry in vietnam   as is happening all over the world  and the ethical credentials of this chocolate plus the taste make it very desirable a great everyday chocolate for those who like something that isnt too aggressive or wackyhow very interesting i had no idea that vietnam produced cacao good for them that would be a fantastic industry and the chocolate sounds nice
well its my turn to test a goldkenn liqueur bar and it happens to contain what is possibly my least favourite whiskey  jack daniels like harley davidson jack daniels seems to have been aggressively marketed to the point where the brand can be seen on everything from mouse mats to wallets so its hardly surprising that this bar was conceivedin essence its the same chocolate as the grand marnier bar   cacao milk chocolate made in the classic swiss style it also has the same thick crunchy sugar shell inside the chocolate to keep the liquid centre from spoiling the chocolate and the filling alas not jack daniels but a jack daniels syrup  yep more sugarthe effect of this accumulation of sweetness is fairly obvious nothing stands out much at all other than the sugar theres a hint of alcohol mixed with sugar some chocolate mixed with sugar and a mouthful of sugar pieces to contend with at the finishstill i suppose brand loyalty will mean that this sells reasonably well but as an example of good chocolate it fails miserably perhaps one of our artisan chocolate maker friends should have a go at making a proper version of this although i would take one of paul a youngs bourbon truffles over a bar of this sickly stuff any daybuy it for your dadboyfriend if you cant think of anything else otherwise why bothercomments are closed
unfortunately their chocolate is quite difficult to get hold of here in the uk while you can find it in paul a youngs london shops it will set you back a hefty  a bar rather than the  it costs in the us but is it worth the price what makes this chocolate so specialwell the packaging is a good place to start its simple but stylish and follows the current trend for thick wallpaper style paper printed with what looks like it could be stylised cocoa pod crosssections it may look handwrapped but dandelion actually have a rather cool machine to do it for themunderneath that wrapper the moulding design is a little more old fashioned the simple pillowshaped squares are simple and they do the job and importantly the chocolate has a great finish to it that packaging has kept it in perfect condition on its journey half way around the worldthe colour is a deep slightly reddish brown and the aroma is rich and fruity given the bean origin its surprising that its so similar to the rzsavlgyi bar the flavour is subtly different though the dandelion chocolate has a smoother more rounded flavour with more red fruit notes with less of the harsh citrus edge the tasting notes on the wrapper mention an almond caramel finish but for me the fruitiness seemed to go on forevereveryone knows that chocolate is better than wine anywayi agree this is an absolutely stunning bar and i too loved the wrapper really nice product inside and out
i cant stress how much i love the packaging here its not just pretty its well thought out the only part of the wrapper unique to this bar is the printed band that goes around the outside the thick paper with its goldprinted bird and flower design has no text and is simply help together with a single piece of decorative tape its luxurious but simple  just as good chocolate should bethe chocolate inside is equally beautiful although as you can see mine has been through the wars a little bit i dont mind  i think it looks like some kind of antique jigsaw and i was planning on breaking it anywaythe colour is interesting  its quite pale for a  cocoa solids chocolate bar you could easily mistake it for a dark milk chocolate in fact but its beautifully moulded and perfectly tempered with a glossy finish and a satisfying snap when you break itthe chocolate has all the madagascan criollo flavour i love its intense and zingy and immediately lifts the senses its full of fruity citrus notes and even a touch of liquorice in there i think theres a little bit more cocoa butter and a bit less sugar than youd normally find and im quite happy with that as the natural fruitiness of the chocolate is sweet enoughi really enjoyed this chocolate and im looking forward to reviewing more from rzsavlgyi csokold i just need to learn how to say itrzsavlgyi csokold is really hard to say and to typethat was the first thing that crossed my mind when i saw the title the wrapping looks very elegant and stylish the bar does look gorgeous what a shine
bertil kesson is one of my favourite chocolate makers but unfortunately his chocolate is a little difficult to get hold of here in the uk i had to learn several secret handshakes and undergo a rather embarrassing initiation ceremony just to get my hands on this barthe kesson family also grow pepper on those plantations so its perhaps no surprise that theyve become famous for this combination of madagascan chocolate and black pepperthat pepper immediately makes itself known when you open the pack the rich aroma of black pepper dominates the chocolate so its fair to say that if youre not a fan of pepper youre probably not going to like thisyou probably dont need a review to tell you that thoughthe madagascan cocoa is fruity but its much more well rounded than some theres a subtle sweetness to it along with a gentle hint of red fruit but its less citrus than many madagascan chocolates i think that works well here because with such strong pepper note an intensely fruity chocolate might be a bit too much as it is the result is a delicious warming chocolate with fruity edge i really like this bar and think its well worth seeking out but make no mistake the pepper isnt subtle but dont be fooled into thinking it will overwhelm you with heat either this is much more about flavour and texture than heat it might not be for everyone but its one of those chocolates you really should try if you can find it  it might just surprise youthanks  i need to pay you guys a visit soonare you kidding me with this im stuck at work on my lapotp starving for any morsel of food and then i come across this pic not cool that cake looks insane
cacao pulp is the white fleshy pulp that surrounds the beans in a fresh cocoa pod when cocoa beans are harvested the pods are broken open and the seeds  pulp are removed normally the seeds are fermented inside this pulp but its actually incredibly tasty  and the only part of the pod thats naturally sweet the beans themselves are bitter and astringent before fermentationunless you visit a plantation its unlikely youll ever get to try fresh cacao pulp its used up in the fermentation of the beans but you can sample it in this barthe flavour is sweet tangy and wonderfully fruity its counteracted by the slight bitterness of the nibs which also act as a great counterpoint to the slightly chewy texture of the small pulp pieces in effect what you have is a fruit  nut chocolate bar where the chocolate fruit and nut all come from the cocoa podits wonderful how well the flavours and textures work together so it surprises me that nobody has done this before in fact it has me wondering if it would be possible to make a dark chocolate thats naturally sweetened with cacao pulp with no added sugar or vanilla now theres a challengewhile were waiting for someone to come up with that i highly recommend giving the madre chocolate bar a go if you love fruity flavours and a bit of crunch in your chocolate then i think youll love it at  it isnt cheap but its unique and delicious and something you really should trythat looks lush it would definitely be interesting to sweeten with pulp instead of sugar i think the sugar is the worrying bit about chocolate though its necessaryayeeeeee i want this 
as you might expect from a milk chocolate with toffee pieces its very sweet i do like the occasional sweet treat though and managed to eat a fair amount of this bar eventually though it did prove just a little bit too sweet for my liking the ghanaian cocoa doesnt have a particularly intense flavour anyway so the sugar can become overwhelmingthe toffee pieces add an interesting texture and theres just the right amount of salt to add an interesting edge but its still too sweet for my tastesthat said this is a confectionery chocolate designed for those with a much sweeter tooth than me and thats how you should judge itpersonally i prefer the green  blacks sea salt bar thats made with dominican republic chocolate and fantastic anglesey sea salt but if you absolutely must have your sugar fix this is probably the one for youhave you tried lauensteins milk chocolate bar with sea salt chocolate chips  vanilla  cocoa trinitarios and rio caribe cocoa beans bourbon vanilla and maldon sea salt i thought it was a pretty interesting experiencebummer for you i do like sweet though
i picked this cavalier banana cocoanibs bar up in egypt but it happens to be belgian in origin oh and note the no added sugar label theres malitol in this bar oh and while were on the subject of ingredients i started to get a little worried when reading the list on the wrapper when a chocolate bars first three listed ingredients are sweetener malitol vegetable fat milk powder i tend to find myself rapidly downgrading my expectationsfurther down the list i discovered that the actual cacao content of this milk chocolate covered bar was  which cheered me up a bit  thats green  blacks levels the addition of cacao nibs for a little crunch and extra flavour seemed like a wise move as well although that would very much depend on how you feel about little chunks of cacao nib floating around in your mouth it all boiled down to the filling really  could this be one of those rare occasions when a banana and chocolate combination didnt disappointi hate to say this but it was okay just okay really the chocolate and cacao nibs added enough flavour to mean that the banana cream filling didnt overwhelm and for me thats about as good as a banana and chocolate combination is going to get its certainly one of the better versions ive tasted the quest continues for the ultimate banana chocolate thoughyup just ok tricky flavour to work outat last someone with real extpreise gives us the answer thanks
its a single origin block of  dark chocolate from cameroon the first time weve reviewed any single origin chocolate from this west african country the beans grown in this part of africa are often of the forastero variety and generally end up in bulk confectionery products rather than fine chocolate because they dont always have the interesting flavour notes of other bean varieties its unusual to see african beans in a product like thisthe beans used in this bar are form a small  hectare plantation and grown exclusively for marcolini that means that the chocolate maker can influence how the beans are treated from the tree all the way to the bar and the finished product is much more likely to get the very best from the beansmarcolini has also chosen to add cocoa nibs to this bar to add a little extra flavour and texture but everything is from the same plantation its a chocolate with only three ingredients  cocoa beans sugar and soy lecithinthe chocolate has an intense aroma that fills the air the moment you unwrap itthe flavour is equally intense its fruity and woody with a slightly acidic edge a little like wine the cocoa nib pieces enhance those notes as well as adding a great texture to the bar its not sweet but thats just the way i like itmarcolini ship throughout europe and you can buy this bar from their online boutique link below i highly recommend giving it a trysounds lusciousdo you mind if i quote a couple of your posts as long asi pidrvoe credit and sources back to your webpage my website is in the exact same area of interest asyours and my visitors would genuinely benefit fromsome of the information you present here please letme know if this ok with you thank you
bonnat apotequil claims to be made from a rare porcelana variety of beans from peru but people ive spoken to suggest that it may not strictly be a porcelana bean my cacao genetics is a bit rusty so i have to take the claims at face valuethat added cocoa butter has a big impact on the flavour of this bar  or at least how the flavour develops because it takes a few seconds to melt first thing you get when you pop a chunk in your mouth is nothing theres an incredibly smooth buttery texture but it takes several seconds for any flavour to come throughwhen the flavour does arrive its sweet but not particularly complex theres a fruitiness to it moving towards slightly citrus notes but i find myself wondering if it was actually worth the wait its pleasant but its not a chocolate i would go out of my way forcomments are closed

the island growers moniker signifies this bar is made from saint lucia beans sourced from estates around hotel chocolats own rabot estate rather than using the rabot beans themselves the beans fermented and dried centrally at the rabot estate before as i understand it being shipped to the uk where the chocolate is made from the beanwhat i particularly like about this bar is the wealth of information provided on the wrapper with some chocolates youre lucky to find the cocoa content listed but with this bar we have cocoa content origin harvest date conche time roast time roast temperature and the name of the chocolate maker thats a lot of informationfor the average person it might be a little overwhelming but i like to think it will pique the curiosity and encourage people to find out a little more about what the numbers mean and how they affect the finished productthe numbers that interest me most on this island growers bar are the roast time and temperature as the chocolate has a very strong roasted almost smoky flavour a smoky flavour on chocolate is often a bad sign as it can mean the beans have been overroasted or that theyve been dried artificially by fire and the flavour has been contaminated with smokei dont think thats the case here though  i think the beans have just been roasted a bit longer than they normally would be the resulting flavour might not appeal to everyone but i find it unusual and quite moreishtechnically the chocolate would probably be a little more approachable if the milk solids were replaced with sugar so this probably isnt the best way into dark chocolate if youre a milk chocolate love the result is interesting and actually quite tasty but its probably more of an experiment than anything else its worth trying though if only to see just how different a milk chocolate can be
as you can see theres no mistaking who made the bar  its an elegant and bold design which lets you know that m marcolini is very proud to have his name embossed into every barso what of the famed nacional cacaowell apparently this particular cacao is grown exclusively for marcolini to turn into chocolate in brussels its a darker purply cacao pod which yields a more intense chocolate and thats exactly what it does here the first hint of red berry and fruit is somewhat deceptive as it very quickly turns into deep dark coffee and treacle undertones  and i mean deepthe treacly flavours are pushed almost to the point of excess before the cacao starts to release its other flavours  sweet light floral notes that dance through the darker flavours and provide a long complex finish its quite remarkable stuff and certainly something i would highly recommend to anyone with an interest in complex intese cacaomarcolini is one of a handful of bean to bar makers and what he has achieved with this cacao is fairly remarkable i tried hard to resist but the bar didnt really stand a chance for fans of big bold cacao with complex flavour and definitely one of my top five so far this yearcomments are closed
theres not much to them and they are delicate enough that one got cracked during their journey to my hands for some peculiar reason the first thing that jumped to mind when i saw them all laid out was communion wafers and i could try to come up with a laboured metaphor about worshipping at the altar of soma as i ate them but i wont heres the rundown of the different flavours this is a good match simply because the sesame seeds fit nicely into the little circles of chocolate  and roasted sesame seeds also bring in a nice flavourthis was the real surprise in the collection the dark red beets added just a touch of sweetness and earthiness and is something that i would like to taste more of there must be someone out there making beet truffles  please get in touchtheres very little to complain about when freeze dried raspberries and bitter chocolate are brought together so this was very pleasant indeed yumthe problem with using discs of chocolate which are only a couple of millimetres thick is that there isnt much room so the pieces of pistachios within are very small and dont give much in the way of nuttiness or to put it another way big chunks of pistachios are always betteranother unsurprising combination but still one which turned out to be a highlight of the envelope just dark chocolate and intense ground espresso beans but a great blend nonetheless again a tried and trusted combination of crunchy nibs and dark chocolate good stuff adds some crunch and not a lot more there was a little bit of nuttiness as an aftertaste but this was my least favourite of the discs because of the ordinariness as with my previous encounters with smoked salt i found this to be a bit overwhelming especially when accompanied by not very much chocolate so while this is a very cool presentation of their chocolate and a nice way to get a little taste of soma there are too many things here which are your standard combinations id have preferred some weirder and wilder flavours thrown in and have this be a testing ground for new ideas but it does function well as a sampler for newcomers to all things soma veterans like myself would be better served by picking up some of their favourite bars insteadcomments are closed
one of the things that drew me to this bar was the packaging something rococo do so well its actually just a simple paper and foil wrapper but chantal coadys designs are simple but eye catching it feels like youre unwrapping a quality productas you might expect from a white chocolate sugar is the main ingredient but its a healthy  cocoa solids cocoa butter so its not overly sweetthe chocolate has a nice creamy edge to it but as you might expect the overwhelming flavour is from the cardamom its deliciously warm and works surprisingly well with the white chocolatein fact its so good that its quite difficult to stop eating you dont notice yourself eating each individual piece but before you know it the bar is almost gone and you feel just a little bit guiltybut you shouldnt feel too guilty this may be a sweet treat but its a quality treat its certified organic with no nasty additives so if youre into white chocolate and want to try something a little bit different then this is certainly worth tryingcomments are closed
on reflection it probably wasnt the best idea the name lindt excellence blueberry intense should have been a clue blueberries are a lot of things but one thing i wouldnt describe them as is intense a quick glance at the ingredients on the back of the packet confirms my worst fears not only is is a paltry  cocoa solids but its also packed with other ingredients mmmmm vegetable anthocyane efeeling a little concerned about what i was about to let myself in for i opened the pack rather than the pristine looking lindt chocolate i had expected this is what greeted me it appears to be covered in dents but i can only assume that those marks are some kind of moulding imperfection as there are no marks on the packaging its quite oddunder the surface and on the underside of the bar lots of bits of fruit are visible along with some fine slithers of almond its not that it looks unappetising it just looks like its been put together in a bit of a hurrythe chocolate itself is very soft theres no snap to it but it bends a little before it breaks thats partly because of the fruit but the poor quality chocolate doesnt helpthe taste is overwhelmingly one of sugar and artificial fruit theres really nothing chocolatey here at all unfortunately bizarrely the fruit tastes more like apple than it does blueberry too that long ingredients list have apple and pineapple on it so i guess i shouldnt be surprisedthe texture of the fruit pieces isnt particularly pleasant either they have a jelly like texture on the outside with a slightly crunchy grainy texture in the middle im not a fani always like to think of lindt as a stepping stone from confectionery chocolate to real chocolate but this is so sweet and packed with unnecessary ingredients i would have to put it firmly in the candy category unless you really like the taste of sugar and artificial fruit you should probably avoid iti completely agree with you for me its all about the  or a classic lindt bunnyyes i agree i tried one a while back  sweet soft and not really tasting of anything muchwhen you buy a pack of fresh blueberries and try eating them they dont have a lot of flavour when cooked in a cake for example they can be rather nice but by themselves they are nothingy i cant think what possessed anyone to try and put them into chocolate because they were never going to work very well in the first placethis bar shows that lindt really need to give up on this one and try something else
ive been meaning to review this bar for a while in fact this is the third bar ive had the previous two bars simply didnt last long enough for me to write aboutat  cocoa solids it has an intensely chocolatey flavour there are notes of banana and red fruit in there with some nutty notes toward the end but this isnt a complicated chocolate its just perfectly balanced and faultlessly executedbut dont go thinking this is a chocolate bar just for awards judges and chocolate reviewers this is a bar that everyone can enjoy every day milk chocolate fans will love the creamy chocolatey flavour as much as anyoneim not going to go into too much depth here because it really is something you need to try for yourselfi have a small g bar here which comes with this very attractive moulding pattern but you can buy the larger g bars on duffys website for a very reasonable  you couldnt buy a half decent bottle of wine for that let alone the best bottle of wine in the world so what are you waiting for go buy it before i doi agree with you i tasted this chocolate last year and i think that therss no one better for dark milk chocolateim a huge fan of ocumare origin chocolate i dont think ive ever tried a bar made with them that i didnt like amano  coppeneur were standouts for meill have to figure out a way to get a hold of this onefor high quality milk chocolate this price is very reasonable im jumping on duffys website to take a quick peek and may be a nice tasty order  thanks for the review i too enjoy a hint of bananacant buy this anywherei bought a g bar at paul a young in the city for   ouch 
in typical green  blacks style the vast majority of the ingredients for this bar are either organic fairtrade or both the crispy part of this bar is made up from five different organic grains and the chocolate has a healthy  cacao content as you can see theres plenty of crunch in the bar which works really well with the sweet milk chocolatein many ways this bar is a tastier better made version of similar milk chocolatecrispy bits bars the higher cacao content obviously makes for a better tasting chocolate and the cereal does exactly what its supposed to its crisp crunchy and adds both texture and subtle flavour to the mixim not a big milk chocolate eater but i found myself going back to this bar which is probably the best recommendation you can make the organic  fairtrade content plus green  blacks wide availability also make this one of the more accessible bars i have reviewed recentlyif you like your milk chocolate then you really owe it to yourself to go for something with a higher cacao content and this is a good place to startcomments are closed
the outer box is very jolly im overlooking their terrible wild boar joke on the outside because i didnt notice it for a few days  if you drop the o from boar it spells bar hagensborg are a little pig fixated it is definitely a little more lighthearted than most single origin bars though the bar itself is adorable really i was just expecting a normal bar but as soon as i took it out of the box still wrapped it felt a little unusual in the shape department unwrapped the strange shape explained itself  the bar looks likes someone took three sneaky bites out of it in addition the bars surface is decorated with the companys signature pig and some appropriate chocolate eating sounds i must admit it made me smile because almost every bar that i cross paths with is plain and businesslike and while i wouldnt want every bar to go for my funny bone i really liked this oneas for the chocolate well the first mouthful was a bit on the disappointing side because it was sweeter than i was anticipating that appeared to be more about my adjusting my expectations because subsequent bites were better like most madagascar bars the predominant notes are fruity and theres plenty of them to go around but it stops short from being a really bold bar of chocolate which is what i want from my bars even if they are cuteit isnt really meek as such but it needs a bit more punch which could come from a boost in percentage or a pinch of salt it does succeed as being a wellbalanced bar of easytoeat chocolate and is a nice gentle introduction to the world of single origin barsi love the quirkiness of this bar one of the things that attracts me to new chocolates is a neat or different packaging i am adding this company to my list of future reviews
thankfully this bar is nipplefree but it does come with a healthy dose of spices and rose petalsill say it right out im not convinced by the look of the mitzi blue bars sure decorating chocolate with petals is going to make it look exotic but the prospect of eating flowers with your chocolate isnt going to appeal to everyone the texture can be a little offputting too i dont mind it in general but sometimes youll get a slightly harder pieces of dried rose petal stuck in your teeth which detracts from the whole idea of an indulgent chocolate experience somewhatthat aside i did enjoy the chocolate its a rich  milk chocolate and like all zotter chocolate its organic fair trade and beantobar its flavoured with almond cardamom and orange blossom oil the almond gets a little lost with the cardamom winning the battle for flavour domination here  and rightly so i actually love the flavour of the chocolate and find myself breaking off chunk after chunk without realisingbut the more i have the more i find those petals annoy me they just dont add anything to this smooth creamy and gently spicy chocolatei know the petals are the mitzi blue trademark but id rather have it withoutthat said theyre really just a minor annoyance whether or not you like this bar really comes down to how much you like cardamom in chocolate im a bit of a fan although its not something id want every day thats something that could be said for a lot of the zotter range thoughcomments are closed
even though it is part of canada newfoundland has always seemed somehow more exotic to me part of that is due to the relative inaccessibility from where i live  getting there involves either overpriced airplane tickets or a sizeable drive followed by lengthy ferry trip but the thing that really does it for me is the fact that they have their own time zone which is  minutes ahead of atlantic time yup when it is pm here it is pm in newfoundland crazinessthe packaging for their boxes look like they was designed to really appeal to tourists with its picturesque photographs of newfoundland  it would make a lovely souvenir of a holiday and to be perfectly honest that brings with it certain expectations which dont necessarily include good quality chocolate or imaginative flavours yet opening up the golden box reveals a very attractive collection of chocolates which is definitely better than your average box of souvenir chocolates suggesting that preconceptions based on the box itself are wrong it goes further than that too  these are handmade chocolates with no preservatives and lots of local ingredients too so once that book judging by the cover thing is gone there are chocolates to be eaten the first collection i tried was the smiling land series it is apparently the companys most popular and has newfoundland wildberries featured in each and every chocolate such as blueberries partridgeberries cranberries and some more conventional ones too that translates into a box which leans on the sweeter side especially because they use a mix of all white mild and dark chocolate and the box is adorned with a photo of a glorious sunset or sunrise not sure which it is very pretty either wayinside the box the celebration of newfoundland continues the foldout card which identifies each chocolate is actually a map of newfoundland and each chocolate is named after a part of the province such as sandbanks provincial park milk chocolate and blackcurrants and bay despoir strawberries with coconut in milk chocolate a little unusual but a cute idea although there appears to be a decent selection in the box the majority of them fall into the berries in chocolate category and that pretty much dictates how youll feel about the box   if you like berries and chocolate this will be the perfect collection for youthe most straightforward chocolates with just a mix of berries and chocolate are a mixed bunch because some of the berries such as blueberries are easily overwhelmed by the chocolate theres no doubt that they are still in there because of the texture but they tend to take an inevitable backseat what they do add is sweetness to overall experience and quite a few in the box were definitely a little too sweet for me although not everyone who tried these agreed the other box i sampled  the rum runners  rogues series  follows a similar template at least on the outside this time the golden box is decorated with a pirate ship and the contents within highlights newfoundland spirits and liqueurs each chocolate is named after some kind of criminal or reprobate such as al capone captain kidd and a surprising number of newfoundland politicians  a nice touchthese are much more to my taste  the alcohol is handled with kid gloves especially compared to some of the chocolates ive been writing about lately but it makes for some interesting combinations of flavours for example the dlberville which has a lovely warm mix of vodka and cherries in dark chocolate there are a few that could happily fit in the smiling land box such as the alfred valdmanis which brings together white chocolate wildberries and plum brandy although it works better in a box where berries are used for sparingly but the pick of the litter is the danny named after former newfoundland premier danny williams which has a centre of dark spiced rum and caramel with some sea salt thrown in for good measure i happily worked my way through the box in less time than anticipated the newfoundland chocolate company have no shortage of ambition and that is reflected in their vast range but within each collection the chocolates do have a tendency to blend together although that is probably why they are all in the same box but it means if things arent clicking for you by the third chocolate then it isnt going to happen so pick carefully when it does match your tastes however theres very little to complain about  these are fine boxes of veryeasytoeat chocolatesyes i think what the nl choco co does really well is celebrate the essence of newfoundland in its chocolate its cool to see someone making artisan chocolate making use of whats grown locally on the rock
as you can see from the photos the naive encyclopedia of chocolate is just a little bit specialinside this simple white box are eight colour coded mini bars its incredibly simple but completely beautiful the packaging sums up naives attitude to chocolate perfectly its very clean and unfussy but its clear a lot of thought has gone into making it look so goodand for the chocolate lover theres lots of interesting information that you wont normally find even on bean to bar chocolate the back of each bar gives the conch time roast cacao percentage and even the bean variety its presented in such an elegant way that even if you dont know what they mean youll probably end up comparing individual bars and working out the differences for yourself thats the beauty of having a collection like this as opposed to a single barthe bars area simple  dark chocolate with what the wrapper describes as a labyrinthine flavour profile i cant argue with that not my favourite dark chocolate in the collection but the richness of the cacao is balanced by a real sweetness that makes it very easy to eatmore of a gianduja than a chocolate this is made with fresh toasted hazelnuts which are added to the milk chocolate the result is a very soft bar that is smooth creamy nutty and simply deliciousthe wrapper describes this as the embodiment of chocolate naive and its easy to see why its beautiful with a glossy smooth texture and deep fruity smoky flavour notes this could well be the one bar in the box that makes you wish youd bought morea  nicaraguan chocolate combined with lithuanian royal coffee an interesting and unusual take on coffee chocolate enjoyable but i think i would have preferred a rich milk chocolate for this onethis bar is made by combining cacao butter with milk and cane sugar and caramelising with the chocolate before adding a little salt and vanilla however something here just doesnt quite work for me  an unsual note in the milk i think interesting but not my cup of teaa  madagascan bean infused with lithuanian honey and possibly my favourite chocolate of the collection the fruitiness of the cacao combined with the subtle honey notes creates a flavour all of its own difficult to describe and even more difficult to stop eatinga rich and creamy milk chocolate with a hefty  cocoa solids a full and intense flavour but still very approachable very enjoyablethis bar is all about textures small crystals of unrefined cane sugar in the chocolate give it a slight crunch the chocolate itself is rich and intense with just a little extra sweetness from the sugarim really excited to see that naive are selling online and delivering worldwide now so really theres no excuse not to click the link at the bottom of this post and pick yourself up a box go and buy some
instead they use a smooth ganache as the vehicle to carry the alcohol and are trying to make a higher class of liquors although there is definitely a tongue in cheek element to how they achieve that they manage to squeeze about th of a shot into each of the generously sized chocolates making them ridiculously boozy  even with the box shut the alcohol vapours can be clearly smelled and the first bite has the potential to take your breath away because this is more alcohol than anybody would ever expect in a chocolate the chocolates look elegant thanks to a simplistic design with just enough information on them to make it easy to identify which is which when it comes down to it these chocolates are all about the alcohol simply because that is the dominant flavour it almost doesnt matter that there has been some effort to use good quality chocolate because of all that alcohol but it still has impact on the texture especially of the ganache  which is great  and the lingering taste at the end so it does what it needs to and a touch morethere are a few different options when it comes to the types of drinks including tequila whiksy and a bunch of mixed drinks like white russians and margaritas the four varieties in the gentlemens club collection which found its way into my hands aremy absolute favourite of the quartet thanks to the presence of some  year old glenlivet a big bold punch of whisky with plenty of sweetness and hints of toffee which is well matched by the chocolate lurking in the background delicious this one benefits from the choice of another really really unsubtle huge flavour this time it is a  year old bourbon eagle rare if that means anything to you which comes barrelling out of the gate all woody and smoky not bad at all compared to the first two this is a whole lot meeker and not in a good way theres no doubt that this is a martini but it suffers by comparison and so was at the bottom of the quartet in my view  this is the better of the two cocktails thanks to the hints of cherry and bitters which linger at the end all in all a more well rounded chocolate but not a patch on the whisky and bourbon so twice the vice have succeeded in doing what they were trying to do  classing up liqueur chocolates definitely a niche product but a well done niche product and it might just be the liquor talking now that ive worked my way through most of the box but i enjoyed these more than i anticipating  now im going to go and lie down for a whilei agree i think they look elegant interesting flavours too
i say relatively restrained because life is never simple with zotter take the chocolate its a  cocoa solids organic fair trade beantobar milk chocolate thats richer than many dark chocolates and it tastes better than most tooinside the bar isnt just nougat either theres actually two layers as far as i can make out one is almond nougat and the other is hazelnut nougat both are soft creamy and delicious and then theres the pistachios just look at the pistachiosim a bit of a sucker for pistachios and love them almost as much as i love nougat so you probably wont be surprised to learn that this g bar disappeared very very quickly as i write this review i have one tiny bitesized piece left a memory of what used to beas is often the case with these hand scooped zotter bars my only real complaint is that the chocolate is so thin its primary purpose is to hold the filling in place and it doesnt have a great impact on the overall experience i love that zotter bring quality ingredients to what is really a confectionery productwow i need to rustle up one of thesei love the sound of this as i am a sucker for pistachios too ive only ever tried a couple of zotter bars one being bacon bits which i loved this one sounds quite sane in comparison but i bet its awesome too
judging by the international chocolate award sticker on the front they must be doing something right  although closer examination does reveal its a silver award rather than gold and for the americas region rather than truly international but its still a good signanother interesting aspect of this particular bar is the texture its incredibly smooth for a coffee flavoured bar im so used to chocolate with a pronounced texture of ground coffee that this took me by surprise somewhat from the texture alone you would think this was a pure milk chocolateim not much of a coffee drinker myself but i do like this bar a lotim still in two minds about whether i would buy it over the unflavoured seriousmilk chocolate though but thats purely a matter of personal taste and if you enjoy your coffee this is a bar youll probably want to seek outyumi absolutely love this bar i think its my favourite of the tcho bars great reviewah well you can comfort yrsouelf with the fact that camelmilk chocolate will still more than likely make it to vancouver before it makes it to dublin meanwhile good luck with your wicked deadline   i know the feelinghi jim i think your reply was in reference to my post on the chocolate of vancouver i am actually in manitoba canada and we do have some good chocolate here but not nearly as much as youll find in vancouver and yes ive tried the camels milk chocolate not my favourite but certainly a worthwhile taste sensation keep up the great work with your blog 
melt chocolates is one of my favourite london chocolate shops but being tucked away in notting hill its a little out of the way when i do visit im so engrossed in exploring the beautiful range of fresh chocolates that i often overlook these g bars so these this bar is part of a box of samples the melt team sent me over easterone of the things i like best about melt is that theyre slightly disconnected from the main chocolate scene in london while they can be quite experimental with their flavours theyre not as influenced by fashion as the big names and just quietly get on with life making what their customers wantsimply wrapped in paper inside a tasteful card sleeve the bar has a luxurious handmade feel to it open it up and youre presented with what looks like a giant lego brickthis is a healthy  milk chocolate which has a great balance of cocoa notes and sweetness theres a subtle nuttiness to it but the overwhelming flavour is sweet buttery popcorn given how finely the popcorn has been chopped i was a little surprised just how intense the flavour is i wouldnt have considered popcorn to be a strong flavour but the small amount in this bar is plentyi have to confess though that im not much of a popcorn fan i dont have anything particular against it i simply prefer the flavour of unadulterated chocolate so while i can happily munch on this is a snack i dont think i could justify spending a hefty  on a barwith a handmade bar like this youre paying as much for the labour and skill of the chocolatier as you are for the ingredients so that price isnt completely astronomical but youd have to be seriously into popcorn to want to buy it i would recommend spending your money on some of melts delicious fresh chocolate range insteadtactfulyummy chocolate everyone like it trulybacon salt
that person is nadia ellingham shes been at the helm of thinking chocolate for quite a few years now and is one of those people who is always thinking about chocolate and she thinks about it in a wonderfully imaginative way coming up with unusual flavours for her truffles such as umami and tomato  basil in fact every year to raise money for comic relief she has a guess the flavour contest where she goes a little wild to keep people on their toesthe thinking chocolate shop is not very big at all  compact and bijou you might say it wasnt really supposed to be a proper shop so much as a space for nadia to make her creations but it had a lovely big window which she filled with chocolately things and so people started coming in to make purchases and as i stood in the shop talking to her there was a steady stream of people coming in to buy her ornate easter eggs  no real surprise considering how they lookednaturally i had to sample some of her very pretty chocolates and these were the highlights from the box although id also like to mention the lemon mousse filled min easter eggs because id happily eat those all day longthe infamous haggis truffle first of all the answer to the question on everyones mind no there is no actual haggis meat in this truffle  it is completely free of entrails instead it is a lovely dark ganache which has been spiced in the same way that a haggis is with nutmeg black pepper and mace and a bit of oatmeal for texture and it is very clever indeed i must admit that there was a big smile on my face as i ate what looked like a truffle and haggis flavours came flooding through an ingenious idea perfectly executed and very very tastya dark chocolate cup housing a very smooth and relatively boozy whisky ganache with just a few nibs on top theres very little to complain about here because the balance between the chocolate and the whisky is handled so well no wonder the scottish malt whisky society asked nadia to make some truffles for one of their tastings id never have thought of combining coconut and citrus yet it works really well the sharpness of the tangerine and lime stay in the background as the chocolate and coconut mix together like sticking some opal fruits into a bounty bar an unusual combination for sure especially because of some unexpected floral notes but all the better for it this was really really good the fruit centre just melts away to nothing at all almost like a sorbet it is flavoured nice and subtly too which is good because that rose could get overwhelming very quickly and there is plenty of space for the dark chocolate that makes up the shell and the crunchy little nibs on topso while it might be the promise of a haggis truffle that brings many people to thinking chocolate there are plenty of other reasons to go back again chocolates are made in small batches with new varieties being introduced all the time so be prepared to be pleasantly surprisedindeed nadias thinking chocolate is truly divine i enjoyed all the flavours that i tried  especially the balvenie whisky truffle edinburgh sure has its share of great chocolate
taza make their chocolate by coarsely grinding cocoa beans in granite mills they dont refine or conch the chocolate the way most chocolate makers would so the result is a texture quite different from what you would normally look for in a chocolate bar where other chocolate makers look to create the smallest possible particle size so the chocolate melts evenly and has the perfect snap when you break it tazas approach is much more minimalistic closer to the chocolate bars we had  years ago its  cocoa solids so its quite sweet but theres also a natural sweetness from the dominican republic cocoa but the overwhelming flavour is an intense fruitiness that fills your mouth with joy if you didnt know better its the kind of chocolate that you might think had added fruit flavours in it i adore itthat said the texture is certainly an acquired taste but if you approach it with an open mind then its a taste you can acquire very quickly i would have no hesitation putting this bar on my must try list for anyone just getting into the world of fine chocolate partly because it shows a very different approach to chocolate making but mainly because its one of the nicest cocoa flavours ive experienced in a very long time its not easy to come across outside the us but its certainly a bar you should seek outcomments are closed
each aromatic family has a different color and each flavor has a different design these in turn match up easily to a flavor guide booklet that also describes the shared characteristics of each family it would be helpful however if the flavors in each family were arranged in the box in the same order as they are in the booklet i also found that i was missing a flavor from the floral family and that a couple of the designs there were different from in the booklet for such a serious collection these details matterbesides floral the other groups are balsam meaning smooth instead of vinegar roasted fruity citrus herbal and spicy designed as a tasting journey this collection is not a day trip but more like a weeks vacation given that there are  carefully selected flavors i would hate to share any of them and after the first day when i had two rows i never wanted to have more than one row a day so its chocolate to take your time pondering overwhile most of the chocolates use a ganache a few have either praline or coulisthe silky ganache remains my favorite almost always there is only one added flavor per chocolate the simplicity of which i enjoyed while the strength of the flavors varies somewhat as is necessary they keep mostly to a balanced level that puts the flavor into focus while staying in harmony with the chocolate the only three flavors that didnt work for me were the praline thyme pink and red pepper ganache and curry pralinemy favorite category was probably balsam which included the decadent papua cocoa ganache and the softrich vanilla bean ganache even the group citrus that i was expecting not to care for turned out mainly pleasant many of the flavors from violet to roasted walnut are familiar but there are also some less common ones roasted pistachio pineapple basil alpine flower and cardamom among them its a good range instantly making you realize the flavors you personally enjoy and the ones that come less natural to youat  les petits richart wont be a casual purchase if you want something smaller you can get piece sets of the individual families for  or a  box with a sampling from each family but i think that if youre going for it at all try to get the full set its the most fun or if you happen to have piles of cash lying around theres an  version that comes in a handcrafted burlwood vaultcomments are closed
of course were a chocolate blog and we can only tell you about the chocolate puds hard as it was we had to eat all the nonchocolate puds without writing a single word that was tough but heres what we thought about gs more chocolatey offeringsi enjoyed this a lot its described as brandy and kirschspiked morello cherry compote smothered in silky mascarpone cheesecake topped with our sumptuously rich chocolate ganache and that about sums it up its light fruity and chocolatey and i really wish it came in bigger sizes theres a really good balance of flavours one spoonful youll get deliciously tangy cherries and the next youll get a mouthful of ganache like most g puds though its gone too quickly thankfully you get two in a packthis large torte is designed to be shared between  people but taking it out of the packaging i was uninspired it looks flat plain and frankly a little dull straight from the fridge i found the texture dry and a bit stodgy toothese are individual chocolate fondant style desserts and about the same size as the standard ramekins being designed to be heated they dont come in glass but are simply wrapped in paper theres a plan dark chocolate version and a dark chocolate with orange oil you can either heat them in the oven or just pop them in the microwave for  secondsboth styles of melting middles are very nice but theyre very very rich what they need is a big dollop of fresh cream to cut through that richness  something that transforms them into a very delicious pud indeedobviously this one needs to be heated in the oven too and i have to say i rather like it it cant be easy to come up with a souffl recipe that can be mass produced and not only rise in the ramekin but also taste good the souffl is rich in flavour but very light in texture i actually prefer that lightness to the melting middles desserts as it leaves you feeling satisfied rather than just full very nicefinally we come to these little pots of ganache this ultra smooth ganache is probably the kind of thing youd put in a packed lunch for a quick chocolate hit it may be small but its rich and very chocolatey for me though just one of these little puds was about as much as i could manage after sampling the rest of the rangeg also make a range of nonchocolate puds of course and these are amongst my favourites i love the fruity desserts and cheesecakes despite not having a lot of time to eat nonchocolate puddingsin fact my only gripe about the entire range is the ramekins back in the old days g puds came in simple ramekins that you would want to keep and serve your own desserts in then at some point they changed the ramekin design and gave them a pronounced lip that not only looks ugly but also makes it more difficult to scrape those last pieces of gooey pudding out im sure there was a very good reason for doing this but if i could just change one thing about g puds it would be to bring back these old ramekins i think i may need to start a petitioni loved the torte it was moist and lovely dense yes but i liked that it had a rich chocolate taste not overly sweet was really lovely sent pete out to buy me another a few days later but he forgot or decided id had quite enough dessert indulgence for the time beingwow and what a lovely goodie bag to receive i love gu puds and the melting middles are my favourites ive not seen the black forest gateaux but will be on the look out nowi cant be the only one with a cupboard full of ramekins what we need is a g amnesty day when they put out bins in supermarkets so we can let them have some of the damned things backunless you miss the old ones so much you fancy adopting a dozen or so
tcho artisan confections is a new range of fresh chocolates designed to complement the companys existing range of bars its always interesting when a chocolate maker turns chocolatier and starts making their own filled chocolates theyve very different skills and it doesnt always work very well in this case though tcho have come up with a small collection of rather delicious chocolatesso lets explore this little box of treatsa wonderfully nutty praline with a delicious crunch enrobed in a  milk chocolate its light creamy and has a great crunch to it im not usually a fan of praline but i could easily eat a whole box of thesei love cherry and chocolate when done right and this one is certainly done right using tchos fruity  peruvian chocolate and wild morello cherries in liqueur its sharp tangy and completely delicious its not overly sweet which is exactly what im looking for in this kind of chocolate and the liqueur soaked cherry has a kick without being overwhelminga fantastic  madagascan chocolate with a blood orange ganache the ganache is so zingy and orangey and is perfectly matched to the citrus notes in the madagascan chocolate shell wonderful stuffthis liquid caramel is quite sweet but that sweetness is offset by an  ecuadorian dark chocolate and a generous helping of cocoa nibs the result is a very enjoyable journey from sweet to darkin short every chocolate in this box is an outandout winner the flavour combinations have been carefully considered and not only match the chocolates theyve been paired with but also fit perfectly with tchos flavour driven approach to chocolate makingif i have one criticism its simply that theyre a little small and a little expensive at  for a box of  chocolates that works out at  per chocolate in proper money which is at the top end of what you can expect to pay for high end artisan chocolates in the uk but you do have to remember that these are handmade from the bean and thats a time consuming and labour intensive process even before you consider the cost of sourcing quality ingredients so even at that price i think theyre worth paying forthe other big downside is that tcho dont ship internationally yet even if they did with such short shelf life products i doubt the confections range will ever be on sale outside the us but if you are able to get hold of them i highly recommend parting with some cashcomments are closed
as you can see they come in several flavours and cocoa percentages but the one thing they dont mention on the box is bean origin  something unusual for a beantobar chocolate maker videris chocolate maker sam ratto tells me this is because they are still working on getting consistent supplies of beans  a problem that often faces artisan chocolate makers he added that these bars are made with beans from the dominican republic ecuador peru and venezuelarather than going with single origin products videri have chosen to create their own blends while i generally prefer single origin chocolate the videri approach means that blends can be created to work with specific flavours and also tweaked from batch to batch in order to create a more consistent flavour when the beans themselves vary larger chocolate companies use this approach all the time in order to try to keep the flavour of the final product the same from year to yearthe bars i was sent to sample arethe highest cocoa percentage product in the range and the only unflavoured dark chocolate while it doesnt have the glossiest of finishes it does have a smooth texture and in interesting flavour although its certainly not the most complex chocolate ive had theres a subtle fruitiness to it and its very approachable and easy to eat i did find it a little too sweet for my tastes though which is odd for a  barthe other dark chocolate bars in the range are flavoured and a lower  cocoa solids this one has small grains of sea salt on the underside which help to bring out the natural chocolate flavours i much preferred this blend to the  and the salt works perfectly to enhance the flavours its very easy to eat this one a little too quicklyanother enjoyable bar i believe this is the same  blend with crushed pink peppercorns embedded into the chocolate rather than salt theres a little bit of a kick to it but the pepper adds more flavour than heat i think i prefer the sea salt version but still enjoyed my time with this chocolateim not a big fan of mint and chocolate together too many cheap chocolate mints as a child finally caught up with me so i wasnt expecting to like this bar where as most artisan chocolate makers would perhaps choose peppermint oil to flavour a mint bar videri have chosen something uniquely american  crushed candy canes and for some reason i find myself enjoying it i think its because the mint flavour isnt overwhelming i can still taste the chocolate albeit sweetened by the candy an interesting choice and one that surprisingly for me works quite wellthe final bar in the selection is a dark milk the label on this one also omits the cocoa percentage but sam tells me its  cocoa solids which is exactly what i guessed the milk solids take the edge off the natural bitterness of the cocoa and give a slightly malty finish but dont expect a sweet milk chocolate here they add a flavour note rather than transforming the chocolate into something sweet and creamy and im ok with thatthe texture is a little coarse but after a chunk or two it becomes quite addictive its an unusual but pleasant experience and one that i found grew on me in terms of flavour i still prefer the  dark chocolates thoughall in all this is an interesting and unusual selection of bean to bar chocolates the packaging is great and the chocolate is very approachable and easy to eat the decision to use blends rather than go for single origin bars perhaps gives less complex and distinctly different chocolates but it does give videri the opportunity to tweak and refine the blend of beans and final recipe without having to rework the packaging every time at the moment the flavours and blends are a little more conservative than im used to and id love to see something more experimental but thats easy for me to say from thousands of miles away with little knowledge of the local market the people at videri do seem passionate about making great chocolate and im sure well be hearing from them again
the slender stick is divided into six small ingots each bearing the rausch name the chocolate is dark and glossy and has good deep fruity aromas with a  cacao content this isnt what we normally refer to as dark chocolate but it certainly isnt milk or bittersweet chocolate although it does lack some of the real depth of higher cacao content products the first impression i got from tasting this chocolate was a light slightly sweet set of flavours with light fruity acidity underpinned by red fruit and a hint of woodiness the finish is long and clean with those light cacao notes persisting throughouti love iti like rausch single origin chocolates in general theyre also available in other formats  as big g bars divided into  x  squares and in an assortment box called rausch plantagenwelt  milk varieties and  dark ones as individual ingotsi just found this bar in dallas tx usa at central market for anyone in the area who would like to try it  it was wonderfully smooth clean and perfect bite sizes  when eating it i found it to be the perfect fit for me as far as dark chocolates go  not too darkbitter afterwards though i found my mouth felt dry and was left with bitter after tones for me  and wanting a drink  i guess this is why i often tend towards semisweet chocolates
save the best for last they say so i didif youve never had a hotel chocolat egg before you may be surprised by the shells theyre thick very thick actually breaking a piece off to taste is a bit of a challenge but ultimately very rewarding of coursefirst taste was the hacienda iara shell its been a while since ive eaten any of this cacao and with a cacao content of  i was anticipating big flavours the surprising thing is how light on the palate the chocolate is it has a delicate soft mouth feel and a lot of acidity but it never cloys or becomes overpowering there are subtle floral notes and the finish is long and light making it dangerously moreish by comparison the sambirano shell has a much fruitier more floral taste which is almost bursting with fruity cherrylike notes its totally different but equally wonderful showcasing just how good this madagascan cacao can be  so much so that i found myself going back for a little more then a little more while making appreciative noises of course its a similar story with the egglets the sambirano one bursts with light floral fruity cacao flavours which if anything are more pronounced due to the filling being made from trinitario  criollo beans while the chilli egglet teases you with more of that fruitiness before the habanero chilli spiciness sneaks up and sets your mouth tingling be warned  this is not a halfcocked chilli trufflethe chuao pecan praline egglet was another stunner a couple of years ago everyone was jumping up and down with excitement about this venezuelan cacao and this serves as a timely reminder of just how good this cacao really is the hacienda iara egglet is further confirmation of how good those flavours areits not often i say this but there really isnt anything disappointing about any of the elements here its an extremely well presented package which does exactly what it sets out to do showcasing some of the worlds best cacao its unfussy elegant and oozes understated class and i liked it so much that i really would be happy to eat one of these every month yes its not cheap at  but im pretty sure youd be hard pressed to find another egg which offers as much in terms of taste  quality a winner in anybodys bookcomments are closed
its a bit difficult to get a sense of scale in these photos so heres the egg lying next to the standard unit of size comparison round here  a p coinso yeah its big but whats the chocolate likeas you can see the chocolate isnt particularly thick  a fact that initially disappointed me until i remembered that it did still weigh kg even with a thin shell more disappointing was the lack of any goodies inside i wasnt expecting it to be filled but i did find myself imagining what it would be like filled to the top with caramelthorntons do actually do higher quality chocolate eggs but this one is clearly made for scale rather than quality if youre the kind of person who thinks size matters then this may be the egg for you if youre into fine chocolate with distintive flavour notes then it definitely isntafter having nibbled on some of the chocolate ill probably use the rest for baking or my own sporadic attempts at making chocolates i just need to clear out another room in my flat to store it all firstsomeone needs to actually do a proper filled egg this size one day
what surprised me when i tasted this bar was how sweet it was in comparison to other chocolate bars with similar content and it wasnt just down to the fruit the cranberries dont seem to pop in the way you might expect from a normally tart fruit but the hazelnuts are crisp and retain their essential nuttiness i found myself wondering whether those cranberries had been treated to a little sugar before being added to the barthe chocolate flavours seem to be overshadowed by an overarching sweetness which had a hint of coconut about it even though coconut isnt a listed ingredient and the most striking thing was just how sweet this  bar was the combination of chocolate cranberry and hazelnut is pleasant enough but once again its the sweetness that i found myself taking issue with it was only really the finishing notes that allowed the true flavour of the cacao to come to the fore which was a little disappointinglaimas chocolate is often pretty poor in my experience ive tried a few of their bars from uk import stores and have yet to find anything thats much good i recently tried one that was coated with the dreaded compound chocolate
firstly we have this cute and stylish easter bunny as you can see ours is green but he also comes in pink and yellow hes made in white chocolate and comes with five mini eggs being white chocolate hes a little sweet for my tastes but i think its a wonderful little gift for children next wrapped in pink polkadot paper is a very simple milk chocolate egg its a rattling egg and in my enthsusiasm i managed to break mine while shaking it thankfully i didnt spill the contents out  lots of little crispy pearls covered in more milk chocolate the milk chocolate is very nice and the pearls  like mini chocolate covered rice crispies  are highly addictive  these are sold in packs of three and again i think theyre a perfect gift for childrenthe halves are glued together with a spot of caramel which im not sure is the best idea i would rather have each half completely separate so i can share or save half without the sticky blob of caramel on the outsidebut thats my only criticism of this beautifully rich salted caramel egg the chocolate is nice and thick and the caramel oozes out seductively when you bite into it these gifts are hand made from quality ingredients and they have a look of simplicity and playfulness to match what i like best about melt is that they tend to do their own thing rather than pay too much attention to the stylish london chocolate scene they cater primarily for locals and everyone else has to make a little bit of an effort to get therecomments are closed
pauls take on a brownie is a gooey fudgey and messy piece of heaven its soft squidgy and moist and melts in the mouth almost like a ganachethis as you may have guessed is his easter offering for  a brownie based on the traditional hot cross bun as well as the distinctive cross on top the brownie is made with raisins currants candied orange and lemon peel port brandy and spicesas you might expect its absolutely delicious the fruits and spices work particularly well with the  dark chocolate used in the recipethe hot cross bun brownie has replaced the simnel brownie this year and although im told you can still by simnel brownies in daylesford organics in selfridges i cant easily get hold of them and as fantastic as the hot cross bun version is i want my simnel brownie backwhen i mentioned my disappointment on twitter paul did tweet back offering to make a limited edition chocablog browniei can but dreamyeah i loved the simnel brownie too though also wanted double the amount of marzipan if paul makes you a special batch hoping he can spare one for mea brownie with all the fruit from this brownie at least double the amount of marzipan of the simnel brownie and maybe a little alcohol to make it especially gooeyliciousthat sounds evil deliciously evilif he makes it ill send you one you can make the simnel ones yourself the recipe is online thats a damn fine looking brownie the cross just adds a little something
the size and presentation of this egg might have you thinking its aimed at younger chocolate lovers but the  cacao milk chocolate and salted caramel chocolate combination may prove to be a little rich for younger people my teenage daughter ended up refusing any more of the salted caramel part because it was just too rich so be warnedin terms of quality i dont think you can get much better than a  cacao milk chocolate and hotel chocolat do a very fine version the salted caramel chocolate is rich and gooey in the mouth with deep lingering flavour eat all of this in one go and youre quite likely to end up feeling a little the worse for wear the lack of anything inside or around the egg might disappoint or even put off potential buyers but for overall quality of ingredients this is definitely one of the better offerings out there and infinitely preferable to about  of the generic chocolate eggs that have been sat on supermarket shelves for the past two months hotel chocolat are now a british cacao producer as well as a chocolate maker  another good reason to get behind the company and show your support by buying something from them this easteri want that now nothing wrong with a richer chocolate  just makes it last longer i can wolf down a load of milk chocolate and its accompanying calories in no time and that just makes it less satisfying than richer chocolate  full of taste  that actually lasts me longerwow  pounds though well ok do send me one
the first conventional easter egg ive reviewed this year is something a little speciali should say from the start that my photos dont really do this egg justicepresented in a simple transparent box it looks amazing very different from your average high street easter egg the entire egg is hand painted i assume with coloured cocoa butter is thats usually how colour is applied to chocolate everything but the bottom of the base is covered so you might be forgiven for thinking this egg is still wrapped somehow unfortunately once again i have to destroy a chocolate work of art in order to prove it to youpaul exclusively uses cacao barry chocolate in his creations cacao barry was one of the two chocolate companies that came together to form barry callebaut the largest chocolate company in the world back in  being so large callebaut are better known for quantity rather than quality but they do still make some pretty good chocolate if you know where to lookthe chocolate in this egg is a very pleasant if uneventful  milk chocolate to which i believe paul has added natural vanilla the press release that came with this egg also mentions added spices but thats not something i picked up i did pick up the vanilla though im not sure how i feel about that  while i enjoyed it i do generally prefer less vanillathat said i think most people will enjoy the flavour and this egg is much more about making a statement anyway giving someone a handmade gift like this is so much nicer than giving them a mass produced egg it comes in at just under  but thats absolutely worth it for the work that has gone into it  and the brownie points youll get on easter morningbeautiful a shame to crack open but not really
ah the salted caramel once considered to be something a little wild and crazy this particular chocolate has come a long way in the past five years or so from being something one could only find at high end chocolatiers to this supermarket assortment yes salted caramels have gone mainstreamso what have sainsburys done with this little ball of gooey loveliness well for a start theyve opted to use surprisingly lowcacao content chocolate for the shells the milk chocolate has a mere  cacao while the dark version weighs in with a weedy  which in my book makes it bittersweet not dark white chocolate is not chocolate of coursethe shells are quite thick which was a pleasant surprise and the salted caramel was in no way offensive i could have done with a little more salt but other than that it was a good caramel with a smooth mouth feel and good flavourthe problem is the chocolate its average at best very average and of course less cacao in your chocolate can only mean more of other things mainly sugar every g of these chocolates contains g of sugar and then theres the margarine margarinepalm fat water coconut oil soya oil rapeseed oil sunflower oil    how much oil can they cram in here engine oil tanning oilto be frank at this point i was quite happy not to eat another and i understood why they were so reasonably priced its because theyre made with a lot of cheap nasty stuff that im quite keen to avoid eating this is the sort of fat  sugar laden chocolate that is contributing to our national obesity problems and as such i would personally avoid these like the plaguei suggest you do likewisethese look great i never did get to sainsburys on my last trip to london will have to next time
this happy little scene weighs g and consists of a milk chocolat mummy pig with dark chocolate and white chocolate pigletsi can only presume multiple daddy pigs were involvedthe milk chocolate is  cocoa solids and is really rather nice its rich and creamy and so much nicer than the average mass produced easter gift i could happily eat it all day i was less keen on the  dark chocolate and white chocolate piglets but theyre ok and its nice to have a bit of variation in flavourof course with such a cute object breaking into it is the difficult part i genuinely felt a little sorry for my piggies as i was about to tuck in its hard enough to crack a pretty egg but when you break into this youre immediately confronted by what looks like a crime sceneyes reader i killed her in front of her children and i felt so bad about it that i ate her headif you can handle the horror of it all then i highly recommend this as an alternative easter gift its handmade with quality chocolate and a healthy dose of love and its really rather tasty tooreally cute product  i love the photo setup with the knifeheh heh a savoury alternative to the lindt bunnythis is adorable it definitely would make a good alternative to the easter bunny badgerwanthttpwwwyoutubecomwatchveiyixcnsliwhat a great product i think it would be harder to destroy than the usual bunny that little piggy face looking up at youeeeek i love these that pictures a bit sinister like haha
this quintessentially english slightly eccentric character can be found across most of the easter range on packaging and even on the eggs themselves of which more later as we say and his adventures across europe will be available to watch on youtubethis box is home to a selection of hotel chocolats egglets which are available in a variety of packages of which more later with this being the flagship egglet box egglets yes egglets because this easter hotel chocolat is very much about the egglets  slightly elongated thick shelled chocolate eggs containing a variety of flavoursthere are eighteen egglets  two each of nine flavours  and a slightly random lemon truffle placed squarely in the centre of the box the emphasis here is pretty much on milk chocolate indeed i was mildly disappointed to discover only two dark chocolate egglets in the box but thats just meso what do we have a brace of white chocolate egglets with either vanilla truffle or classic praline five milk chocolate egglets which include a salted caramel pink champagne and honey  almond and the two dark chocolate egglets  irish coffee and chilli praline respectivelyif you know hotel chocolats products then youll be familiar with the actual chocolate itself if youre not that familiar with their goods there are plenty of helpful reviews contained within this blog so  theres no real need to go into too much detail suffice to say that as someone who prefers the more cacao less sugar approach i found the overall style of the box to be a little sweet for my tastesthe predominance of milk chocolate and hcs milk chocolate is on the sweet side really puts this box squarely in the family chocolates bracket  albeit a slightly posh family who dont mind spending  on a box of chocolatesthe fillings are really the crux of the matter here and i found most of them to be very agreeable the salted caramel was well balanced the pecan  praline delivered rich deep nutty flavours the cherry bombe was bright and zingy and the irish coffee was a bit of a surprise with its boozy coffee punchinessi did find the lemon truffle a bit incongruous sat there in the centre of the box with its spherical shape and lemon sugar dusting in fact it was probably my favourite of the white chocolates due to a really lovely tart lemon burst which cut through the sweetness of the white chocolate a treatthe vanilla truffle egglet has my name on it  does seem a bit steep though wow very swishtheir bunny mascot is too cute nice writeup bit difficult to see the size of the eggs from the photos but they do look delicious the price is what id expect not too sure about the human bunny though lolim disappointed you say they are high end family chocolate because i though they were quite good generally i meanegglet the name alone makes me want to buy it
like the ultrasweet but quite moreish stracciatella these lindt lindor coconut balls have a sweet creamy white centre the coconut variety however are enrobed in a slightly less sweet  milk chocolate which i have to say is quite a welcome relief from the full on sugar rush of stracciatellathe moment you unwrap one you can smell coconut and thats the overwhelming flavour as soon as they hit your mouth even before the milk chocolate has melted the coconut takes over so its fair to say if youre not a big fan of coconut youre not going to like thesethis however was just a bit too sweet for me and i couldnt manage more than a couple before feeling id had enoughif you have a very sweet tooth and you love that bounty flavour but want something a little smoother then you might like these but i cant say im a fanyumlindor chocolates are my absolute favorites i received a variety pack for christmas with milk dark and white chocolate shells as well as a nut variation i swear those white chocolate ones are cream heaven must try these coconut ones nowon a different subjectwas reading your  blog on red tulip elegant rabbits am i the only one who has had the biggest disappointment of my life because they have changed the chocolate this year i am heartbroken because this is my chocolate binge for the year taken from me its lost its distinctive flavour melts too readily and doesnt have that lovely snap when broken anymore even from the fridge i am devestated have you noticed
it is a wonderfully elegant collection from the pretty box to the perfectly formed chocolates the chocolates are all the same little squares with simple decorations apart from one which almost looks like it showed up uninvited to the party all very inviting here as always are the highlights if you are going to make a curry chocolate it is best not to go overboard and that is the case here there is a slight curryish murmur at the background that never overwhelms and doesnt give way to any real heat either if this was an actual curry then chances are youd be really disappointed but as a chocolate it works a simple dark ganache in a  shell nothing fancy but perfectly executed as was its milk chocolate equivalent the sateen smooth creamy and very tasty  i could quite happily eat a box of just these this is the chocolate that towers above all the others because of the two very substantial layers within the organic peanut truffle layer is yummy enough but the combination of strawberry and raspberry jam really pushes it over the top apparently it is available in a dark chocolate variety too but the chocolate really takes a backseat to the interior so i dont imagine it matters too much never has a chocolate been more aptly named ganache with just a hint of mint and it really doesnt feel like enough those are not fans of minty chocolate might breathe a sigh of relief but i want to feel like ive just brushed my teeth after i eat something with mint in the title i should look out for tons of mint instead if it wasnt for the fact that the little map told me that this was green cardamom id never have known a really unusual flavour that reminds me of a perfumed tea but it was handled with subtlety so it never got close to overwhelming the dark chocolate not sure if i liked it but id be willing to eat a few more just to see a delicate balance of lemon and basil with a hint of mint which quickly disappears amidst the sweet white chocolate people who like the idea of this will probably like it a lot im kinda on the fence a black forest gateau in chocolate form the centre is a heady mix of dark sweet cherries with a kick of port to give it some lovely warmth one of my favourites in the box theres no mistaking the very canadian sweetness that comes from maple syrup but i had more difficulty detecting the walnuts which are apparently in there the maple bit is perfectly fine but it would have benefitted from the crunch and bitterness of some walnuts in there out of the dozen chocolates the ones that really didnt work for me were the ones where the flavour was handled with kid gloves  i dont mind subtlety on occasion but the meek levels of spice were a little on the disappointing side the bolder ones were great especially the fruit ones and they really stood out for me somewhere amidst their complete range lies an absolutely perfect box of chocolates but id definitely need to do some more tasting and switch a few out to get there im more than willing to give it a try thoughthis is why i stick to cheap chocolate  those truffles just look too pretty to eat
this year has been particularly busy what with easter falling so close to valentines day and mothers day so ive been asking chocolate companies to send me things that are a bit different from the standard egg theres only so many ways you can write about thosei love this kind of packaging its simple and recyclable but bright colourful and enticingthese jelly beans are my favourite though i have to admit im a bit of a jelly bean fan and i do like the zingy fruity flavours in these beans yes its just candy but its a nice contrast to the rich  milk chocolatethe mini eggs and smarties if a bit of a crunch to them which is nice but im all about the jelly beansobviously though these are aimed at kids and i think theyll just love themyes hollow eggs are the worst especially when the chocolate is cheap rubbish made by nestlei love the idea of a jelly bean filled egg yumeverything about the presentation is spoton the traditional egg carton the contrasting and gleaming colors and even the surprise of whether you hit smarties or jelly beans on the inside great findthey look great i love organising a garden easter egg hunt every year for siblings and friends the grown ups get impressively excited and competitive and its great to find eggs that arent just tiny and boring or hollow and disappointinglittle eggs inside a big egg thats genius
the almonds come from a farm in california and are roasted in olive oil before being added to the bar with a sprinkling of maine sea salt bite down on a big chunk of almond and you can taste a hint of the olive oil as the nut reveals its flavours the chocolate has the characteristic grainy texture i have come to expect from a mast bar and delivers bold dark cacao flavours with high acidityits certainly not for the faint hearted  as the chocolate starts to melt that initial deep treacly flavour gives way to more complex but no less robust dark woody flavours the almonds combine with the cacao to smooth things out a little and that touch of sea salt helps to bring out some of the sweetness from the cane sugaras someone who is quite partial to high cacao content bold flavoured chocolate i found myself really enjoying every chunk of this bar but i cant help thinking that it might be a bit much for some people particularly those of you who may prefer milk chocolate its certainly a bar for the adventurous palate and given that it costs about seven times as much as a standard bar of chocolate its definitely something to savour over a few daysi believe the cacao should have remained at gosh looks delicious and what beautiful packaging
so what flavours have zotter chosen to represent the easter season why advocaat and chilli of courseand why notwith zotter easter fire the traditional easter advocaat and chilli is mixed into a white chocolate ganache with a few other ingredients before being wrapped in a  beantobar milk chocolatehow does it taste well like advocaat and chilli of course its actually very nice indeed the filling is smooth and creamy with a very gentle alcohol kick the chilli is a little bit stronger than i was expecting and thats fine by me the heat gently builds as the chocolate melts and leaves you with a rather nice tingling sensation perfect for the cold whether were having here in the uk at the momentas with most of these filled hand scooped zotter bars the chocolate is very thin so you dont get a lot of flavour from it unless you take the time to lick it off first in the interest of science thats exactly what i did and it has a very pleasant creamy flavour but the filling is definitely the star hereoh yumhmmm normally i like to bite into chocolate to reach a layer of  more chocolate but i do love a chilli kick and the right filling can really sell a chocolate turkish delight take a bow think i might give them a try also in the name of science 
this is an entirely different interpretation of a chocolate tea though for a start its an infusion as theres no tea in it at all  its actually  pure cocoa duffys explanation is that the word infusion sounds a bit clinical and im inclined to agree look at the tea shelf of any supermarket and youll see a plethora of flavoured infusions that arent actually teawhen you open the packet youre greeted with the most amazing deep chocolatey smell its utterly fantastic and i could happily just stand and sniff the packet all day as you might expect it smells exactly like a chocolate factoryduffy recommends making this brew in a cafetiere but i happened to have some fillable teabags so i decided to just add a couple of teaspoons full of the mixture to a bag and dunk it in a cup full of hot water im not a fan of washing up and teabags are so convenientimmediately the aroma changes to one of a superrich hot chocolate its tempting to drink it immediately but i decided to give it a couple of minutes before removing the teabagnow heres where you have a choice even the best cocoa beans can be a little bitter if youre not used to the flavour so youll probably want to sweeten this you can use sugar honey or anything you like to sweeten it  i happened to have some vanilla sugar to hand so i put a teasponful in my cup and settled down to try itthe flavour is amazing as you breathe in the vapours your mind is tricked into believing youre about to try the richest creamiest hot chocolate imaginable but the flavour is something different entirely its pure chocolate but its light and refreshing youre not going to feel bloated after a cup of this youre going going to feel calmed refreshed and ready for another cupi love this stuff its about as simple as a chocolate drink can be and thats the beauty of it if youre not used to rich dark chocolates then i recommend experimenting with the amount of sweetener or even adding a little milk for me just a single spoon of sugar and its perfecthighly recommendedi can hardly wait to get my hands on this ive been drinking cocoa tea as mott green used to with grenada chocolate co cocoa powder for years this looks like another that should be a staple in my cupboard
normally fresh chocolate ganaches are made with cream decidedly not vegan or water very difficult to get right but bianca has chosen to make her ganaches with coconut milk insteadi was a little skeptical about this idea but eager to try them nonetheless when they arrived i found myself pleasantly surprised by the attractive looking chocolates in the boxso heres some of the highlights from this boxi thought this unflavoured ganache would be a good test of just how well a coconut milk ganache compares to a cream ganache bianca uses a  callebaut dark chocolate to make her ganaches and while not the best chocolate in the world it does provide a good balance between flavour and affordability bianca tells me she put a lot of effort and experimentation into finding the right couverture and i think shes found one that works well for herthe ganache is a little firmer than i would expect from a traditional cream recipe but its still nicethe dusting of cocoa powder gives a nice rich chocolatey edge and while you can certainly taste the coconut its subtle  as it should bethe most eye catching chooclates in the box thanks to their dusting of freeze dried strawberry powder i love the way dried strawberry comes alive as it hydrates in the mouth and i really did enjoy this chocolate very much the flavour is vibrant but it doesnt overwhelm the chocolate at alla lovely smooth truffle with very well balanced flavours like the strawberry the flavour is quite strong but doesnt overwhelm the chocolatethe unusual irregular shape of this chocolate led me to believe it was going to be a hard caramel but its actually quite soft and rather pleasant id prefer a touch more salt but i could still eat these all dayone of the softer ganaches in the box and one of my favourites another great balance of flavours the glenlivet  year old malt whiskey really comes to the front but as with the marc de champagne truffle never overpowers i love this onemade with blackberries blackcurrants raspberries and redcurrants this is another tangy fruity ganache and a great one to end this particular exploration with its refreshing tasty and leaves you wanting moreoverall i was very impressed with this selection if i hadnt been told i wouldnt have noticed that most of them were made with coconut milk rather than cream as an option for vegans or those who need to avoid dairy id highly recommend themif i had once criticism  and its barely that  it would be that the consistency of the ganache is a little firm compared to most  artisan fine chocolates made with cream but i would still be very happy to give or receive a box of biancas chocolates any timecomments are closed
their truffles are large enough to qualify as two bite for anyone with a normal sized mouth and they all have a substantial outer shell that means they need to be bitten with a certain amount of force and it does help that in the majority of cases the chocolate in question is a robust  organic variety that has an equally robust flavour so even if the centre isnt very good theres plenty of solace to be found on the outside that wasnt much of an issue though the decoration is mostly functional  usually some kind of white chocolate design to allow it to be identified on the map with the occasional nut but nothing that really impacted the taste the box i got my hands on had a dozen chocolates with some of the usual suspects that everyone seems to have and a few surprises too here are the highlights i always pair espresso with dark chocolate in my head but this goes in the opposite direction trying to balance out the deep coffee flavour with creamy milk and just a hint of orange a surprisingly successful pairing it starts off as being all about the cinnamon than chili but then completely changes direction at the halfway point as the heat begins to build im a big fan of this particular combination of flavours and so i didnt need much convincing to make this one of my favourites in the box this one is really clever it starts off with a very bitter chocolate shell which is washed away by a light creamy centre before a rush of pepper swoops in for the finale one of the best pink peppercorn chocolates ive ever had because it really delivers on its promise rose is one of those flavours which is easy to either go overboard with or no put enough in and this leans towards the latter even with the addition of cardamom the centre struggles to be noticed when dark chocolate in thrown into the mix ark chocolate dark truffle and a very generous splash of an unnamed single malt not subtle at all and all the better for it this for better or worse has become the yardstick by which boxes of chocolates are measured simply because of its ubiquitousness this one is a good one  it goes with the less runny caramel and even though there is some chocolate in there the primary flavour is a rich buttery caramel using smoked salt also boosts its profile and cuts right through the sweetness yum one of the vegan chocolates in the box not that youd know a nice rich nutty ganache which slowly fades into dark chocolate nothing new but well executed and preferable to the vegan burnt almond which was a bit on the dry side all in all i was rather impressed although they werent the most exciting chocolates to look at they more than compensated in the taste department and that is much more important delight chocolate are another reason for those with an interest in all things chocolatey to spend some time in toronto comments are closed
i was mildly excited when i spotted this bar while on holiday last month could their solid chocolate bars be anywhere near as good as the drinking chocolate had beenthe answer to that was yes it could get worse you could be made to eat some of this stuff there are no less than four different oils palm shea and illipe oil plus castor bean oil in this bar and no mention of cocoa content whatsoever i didnt even know what illipe oil was and had to refer to wikipedia for information its a fastgrowing tropical tree with seeds that produce oil that is used in cosmetics foods and detergents yumso expectations thoroughly shattered i braced myself for a tastethe chocolate smells like the cheap ersatz chocolate my polish grandmother would give us in the s theres hardly any real cacao aroma at all its just a bit flat and dull and thats more or less how it tastes its more like the idea of chocolate than actual real chocolate and it has an undertone of wrongness to the flavour that meant i was never going to eat more than one piece the aftertaste is mainly greasy sugar with hardly anything of note lingering on the palatei suppose if i had to find one positive thing to say about this bar it would have to be it didnt taste as awful as hersheys normally doeshardly a glowing recommendation now is itsounds like a horrible bar  just on the note of polish babcias  i have a very fond memory of mine returning from a trip to poland  bringing back chocolate for all the grandkids  i do remember that it wasnt stellar but definitely different than anything id tasted here in canada
this is a loose tea but metrodeco were kind enough to supply some tea bags to make my infusion with some hot water and three minutes later and my tea was readythat said this is a very pleasant tea and one that ill certainly be enjoying again dont expect a major chocolate hit from it but if you like green tea and chocolate its well worth tryingcomments are closed
i picked these up en route home from egypt with hindsight i realise that those rucksacksized bags were there for a reason chocodates are somewhat moreishthink about it you begin with something wrapped in milk chocolate bite down through the shell and you encounter a whole date  soft sweet gooey fruitiness delicious the coup de grace is the single crisp almond at the heat of each piece its a great counterpoint to all that squidgy gooiness and finishes the whole experience off beautifullymy only problem with chocodates is the obvious one the chocolate is a bit poor its a standard issue  cacao milk chocolate and it doesnt really deliver much in the way of a taste experience each time i had a chocodate i found myself thinking these would be so much better if somebody decided to bring out a posh version with some proper chocolate and thats more or less the thrust of this reviewi can see why chocodates are so popular but i can also see how an upmarket version made with either a high cacao milk chocolate or a top notch midrange dark chocolate would transform these into something quite spectacular  so when youve made your first batch oh chocolatier could i have a few to sample pleasethese are very frequently available in many supermarkets in qatar yet i somehow never got around to trying them assuming them to be of poor standard however having read this review i  will definitely give them a try soon here in qatar a shop by the name of al bateel does really good chocolate covered dates as does another one called wafi gourmet but they are quite pricey though hence not something i buy all the timehttpwwwfacebookcomthedelightsshopi want to buy choco dates of arabian delight brand from dubai can you please let me know from where can i buy themsoon in dubai with the real and original chocodates made in palestine using the finest kind of dates that does not grow in any arab or foreign country except palestine and the usa this kind of dates does not even grow neith in saudi arabia nor in iraq the palestinian dates r very tasty health and rich soon will be in dubai and with real and original holy taste of dates and chocodatesthanksanybody knoe if we buy these in toronto cansdathanks simon for the great comments in your article i have mentioned our web site wwwchocodateglobalcom where you will be delighted to find that we have indeed created other flavors in our chocodate range in addition to milk flavor we have added the dark and the white launched in march  with our international packagingin response to hassan i have given your email to our export manager covering the maldives
i realise thats unlikely to change charbonnel chocolates arent really designed for me  but i was still curious to see what theyd come up with for valentines day when they offered to send this g box the packaging is rather nice the heart shaped box is both attractive and sturdy its the kind of thing you might want to reuse for something the list of ingredients on the back is lengthy to say the least but these arent fresh artisan chocolates so you can expect some preservatives plus of course the ingredients cover every chocolate in the box  and in this box all the chocolates are differenti wont even be attempting to talk about each individual chocolate here but rather give an overall impression of the collectiontheres a good mix of  cocoa solids milk chocolate and  dark chocolate theyre certainly designed for someone with a sweeter tooth than i but the most noticeable thing about them is that theyre quite a bit larger than i was expectingthere are plenty of fondant type fillings in the collection some fudge and caramel variations and a few with nuts in terms of flavour many of them reminded me of quality street so if thats your thing you may well love them i have to say though that despite the nice presentation and decent sized box these didnt really do it for me and with only a day to go until valentines days i do think youd be better off getting hold of some real fresh artisan chocolatesbut if your valentine is into the sweet stuff these may sufficehave you ever tried leonidas bonbons or did you write an article somewhere on the site couldnt find it at this moment they are delicious di thought c w were meant to be  a bit high end clearly not disappointing i should just make my own chocolaterie owner leonidas are amazing
the chocolates area beautifully smooth dark chocolate blackberry ganache infused with star anise i love the flavours in this chocolate and the texture is spot on this one is a little odd you dont often see pineapple flavour ganaches and tasting this one i can see why its not unpleasant just unusual and not really my cup of tea perhaps this would be better with a milk or white chocolate ganachea milk chocolate heart with a lemon and white chocolate ganache decorated with crystalised violet this is an incredibly zingy citrus ganache that tastes like lemon card the sweetness of the milk chocolate is a nice counterpoint to the lemon but the violet is a little lost in the mixthe other milk chocolate heart in the box is equally zingy the passion fruit caramel has a wonderful flavour but i was unprepared for quite how liquid it would be  and consequently lost half of the contents down the front of my jumper  what i did manage to get in my mouth was delicious and the delicate rosemary flavour came through at the end very nicelyoverall then a rather delicious selection of fresh chocolates  with the possible exception of the pineapple which im not quite sure about i wouldnt hesitate to recommend them if your budget can stretch to it however it does have to be said that at  plus postage for  chocolates theyre a little on the expensive side im used to paying  a for a single artisan fresh chocolate but  per chocolate is pushing it a bityou can buy them online but if youre in london or chester i highly recommend a visit to one of rococos four shops to buy them in person as thats an experience that is worth paying a little extra forrococos presentationdesign of the chocolates is beautiful  i love details especially on small goods
i love this time of year valentines day and easter mean only one thing for me  vast quantities of chocolate but more often than not that quantity comes at the expense of quality i have so many experiences of cheap seasonal chocolate or mundane easter eggs that turn out to be completely hollow that i dont often hold out a lot of hope for seasonal chocolate treatsinside there are eight rather inviting pink champagne truffles simply packed with paper to stop them moving around the packing seems to have done the job perfectly as they survived the rigours of the postal system in perfect conditionwhen removed from the packaging you can see just how pretty the truffles are but more of them in a moment first i want to talk about the chocolate heart they come init not only looks good but its made from quality chocolate too its a  cocoa solids venezuelan dark chocolate made by felchlin a well known quality swiss chocolate makeri think its the perfect choice to accompany these truffles theres quite a lot of it so you wouldnt want a bitter chocolate and a  might just be a little too dark as it is its sweet and smooth and very easy to eat its not a particularly complex flavour but its pleasant nonethelessbut the real stars are the champagne truffles theyre dusted in pink icing sugar so you instantly get a burst of sweetness before the chocolate comes to the front the ganache is very smooth and fresh and the champagne flavour balance is just right its quite a gentle flavour rather than a full on alcoholic kick which is just the way i like it they are very difficult to stop eating once you get goingat  i think this is a great value handmade valentines gift thats a bit different from the mass market alternatives if youre going to give a valentines gift at all i think its worth choosing something that looks like youve put a bit of thought into it and this fits the bill nicelyglad to see bettys using such great chocolate the quality chocolate situation is not great at the moment in britain with bill from sir hans sloane leaving the country demarquette closing his shop and rafaela baruzzo now decamping to saint petersburg
the classic white box with its magenta ribbon arent entirely to my tastes but they work a shiny silver wrapping inside the box adds glitz and the design of the nine chocolates inside heads over to casual and playful territoryso the first impression i get based only on looks is what i often get when viewing a company this way minimalist exterior and funky interior do they go together to create one clear vision one single image that embodies richart chocolates or are they still two concepts that havent quite come together yetthe selection of chocolates offers a balanced variety of three each of white milk and dark chocolates the chocolates in my box were less than pristine but they did travel a ways to get to me i find myself enjoying the white chocolate best undoubtedly because it contains hazelnut praline and i cant resist hazelnut in chocolate the twist is the addition of penja white pepper in the right dosage to give a sensation of warmth at the end without an excess peppery taste its a wonderful munching chocolateon the other end i cant care overly much for the milk chocolate as its dominant flavor is passion fruit which is in an unsalted butter caramel filling the caramel is dark in color and freeflowing which i neglected to think about when commencing to break the hearts with my knife the buttery caramel means that this is a sweeter and less sour combination than some passion fruit chocolates its properly valentines i suppose provided you like passion fruit youll also note that both the white and milk chocolates contain dark chocolate under the surfacethe last heart encloses rose and lychee white ganache with criollo  chocolate from venezuela always a good sign to have that type of info on a chocolate the ganache is fragrant and perfumed like milky turkish delight the chocolate is dense and dark neither bitter nor sweet it doesnt call the attention overly to itself but lets the rose take the majority of the weight theres an endearing softness to this chocolatenone of these chocolates wowed me but i enjoyed them at  each heart comes out to be about  i would be callous to say that that isnt roughly average if anything only slightly higher but i still find it too much even  would sound better for  i want this collection to be more special these chocolates had a good balance of flavors and were neither mundane nor too adventurous meaning good things for a valentines box but i would like to see a few tweaks to make them that much bettercomments are closed
this years collection is apparently all about finding the right chocolate for the right person hence every chocolate in the box has a different personality from the london gent to the hipster i confess to being a little confused by the concept as it implies that you not only have nine people in your life but also that youre buying them a single box of chocolates to shareof course all that actually matters is the chocolate so what exactly will your nine valentines be getting theres a helpful menu included in this box and the first thing that stands out is just how many collaborations there arepaul loves to work with other artisan food producers to make his chocolates and the valentines collection contains collaborations with the likes of roddas cream tapped  packed coffee the rare tea company and ginger pig for me thats reason enough to buy themso lets go through them in order the chocolates arethe london gent  treacle  black pepperim not sure why this is called the london gent but whatever the reason the chocolate is delicious a subtle treacle flavoured ganache in a dark chocolate shell i didnt pick up much pepper here but i loved it just the sameginger pig black pudding beer  ginger biscuityes thats black pudding in a chocolate its a flavour that has been around for a while and obviously means this collection isnt suitable for vegetarians the flavour is interesting but its not my cup of tea chopotle chilli and thames honeythis chocolate has the same smokey edge as pauls chipotle brownie but i have to admit i wasnt keen on the honey flavour here and think this chocolate would have been better without it that may be a matter of personal taste as im not a big fan of honey in chocolate anyway i did like the heat that built toward the end thoughlove potion floralsim not usually a fan of florals in chocolate  i find flavours like jasmine often end up tasting a little like soap to me but this chocolate is delicious theres a hint of rose combined with other delicate floral hints that i cant quite put my finger on  but i do know i enjoyed it maybe i do like florals after all i never did find out what the love potion ingredient was thoughroddas cornish clotted cream raspberry champagne  rosethe heartshaped chocolate in the centre of the box is like a sophisticated turkish delight that rose flavour works wonderfully with the smooth cream ganche and the raspberry champagne just provides a tangy hint that cuts through the sweetnesstapped and packed espresso bean martinitapped and packed is an independent coffee chain with three shops in london its where the hipsters hang out and drink espressos while talking about their iphones and eating cake ive no doubt theyll be eating these chocolates too because theyre amazing a strong fresh coffee flavour and a hint of alcohol from the sipsmith gin works amazingly with the dark chocolate shell i could definitely do with a few more of thesethe hipster  bourbon cigar tobacco  cocoa nibsi have to confess theres little i find more annoying and pretentious than hipsters so its not a name i would have chosen for this rather delicious sweet and spicy chocolate its rather enjoyable with a gentle heat from the tobacco leaves that builds slowly even after the chocolate has gonerare tea company bergamot tea orange  lemon curdtea is a popular flavour in chocolate but a difficult one to get right its so subtle that the chocolate often overwhelms it i confess i didnt pick up a lot of tea notes in this but i absolutely loved the orange and lemon curd in a white chocolate ganache theyre flavours i like anyway and the balance is perfect hereindian rose petal masalathis one has a very interesting flavour combination thats really quite nice the white chocolate ganache lets the flavour of the masala spices and rose come to the front and is a nice counterpoint to the dark chocolate shell all in all this is a great collection of chocolates i had my own favourites and im sure others will choose differently as a whole i dont know that theyre particularly valentinesy but that just means you can buy a box for yourself without feeling guilty theyre too good to share anywaywhilst of course youre perfectly entitled to have  cohabiting lovers if you wish as with all of my fresh chocolates what you choose to have in your own personal valentines selection box is down to you as boxes are filled on demandid therefore expect people to choose the one two or few that they think their partner would most enjoyill be giving myself a valentines gift of a big box of them all though as theyre all my favouritesbestspaulayoungah thanks for the explanation that makes more sense yes hi dom the london gent is all about being the smooth warming and sophisticated with a masculine aroma black pepper is used in many gents perfumes and toiletries as a non floral non soapy scent and warming glad you liked it
harrods may not be a name you would normally associate with chocolate but this year the department store has an extensive valentines range from chocolatiers large and small including some ownbrand offerings like thisobviously the packaging is what youre going to notice first and as you can see its really rather nice made from a thick red card with gold embossing it certainly looks the part the harrods name adds a certain something to the feel too of courseinside though its a fairly standard looking box of belgian with the chocolates squeezed in with no room to sparethe important thing to keep in mind here is the difference between belgian chocolates like these and fresh chocolates that you might find at your local artisan chocolatier these chocolates are designed to have a fairly long shelf life  months in this case and as such they use preservatives and dont feature ingredients like fresh cream which would have a shelf life of no more than a couple of weeksthat doesnt have to be an issue but its always worth keeping in mind long shelf life chocolates like these rarely taste as good as ones made with fresh local ingredients so ill be comparing these to the likes of hotel chocolat or thorntons rather than paul a young or william curleywith that in mind i decided to dive in theres no menu as such but theres a nice selection with two of most flavours thats a simple thing that goes a long way to making a box of chocolates a shareable experience the only exception is the foilwrapped red heart in the centre of the box which turns out to be a fairly average pralinei happily worked my way through each chocolate in the box but after a while i was finding the sugar level a bit hard going some of the centres are also a little dry for my likingi think these chocolates would suit someone with a much sweeter tooth than me while i didnt dislike them its really tough to justify the price when there are just too many small artisan producers making nicer chocolates  some of them are even available in harrodsat  for g of belgian chocolates youre clearly paying a premium for the harrods name having had a preview of the valentines range available in store i can say that they have some quality chocolates and wonderful patisserie on offer i dont think i would part with quite so much of my hard earned money for this particular box thoughabsolutely loving that harrods chocolate box good packaging goes a long way with me but i dont think i could ever justify spending quite that much on chocolatestweetedlovely prize
weve reviewed paul a youngs brownies several times in the post so the chances are you already know what to expect here a delicious gooey fudgey chocolatey block that may not technically be a brownie but it tastes so good that doesnt really matterthis valentines day variation is made with chipotle chilli maldon sea salt and muscovado sugar and in my opinion its up there with the best of pauls creationsthe initial flavour when you bite into this brownie is quite random thanks to the scattering of salt and sugar on the surface you might get some sweet sugar crystals or you may get something a little saltier but that initial burst gives way quickly to a deep rich chocolatey flavour with a smokey edge thanks to to the chipotleits a flavour that works very well with the chocolate and as the brownie melts away in your mouth the heat from the chipotle starts to take over while quite noticeable the heat is never overpowering though and like the taste its perfectly balanced i would give a brownie for valentines dayto myself  well this one anywayoh gosh wish he was in australia looks like we have to make a london trip this year sometime for our brownie fix was just checking out his valentines day truffles and came across your site and yes id give a brownie or more likely brownies for valentines day  theyre my favorite cakedessert
im recently back from a week away in egypt and naturally i had a little trawl around the local shops to see what was on offer by way of chocolateif you have any interest in chocolate and visit any muslim countries youre probably already aware of a couple of things there isnt much in the way of locally produced chocolate and what there is can be decidedly average arabs have a major sweet tooth meaning that good quality chocolate is fairly hard to findthe chocolate is sweet and distinctly average but when the centre starts to melt the magic happens and it has very little to do with the outer shell the pistachio cream filling is rather lovely and my palate welcomed it more than it did the milk chocolate in fact id go as far as to say that i would happily have taken the filling on its own better yet how about a dark chocolate version made with something a bit more decentits almost as though youre tasting a filling that took ages to get right but was then just covered in the usual and thats a shame okay were not talking top end chocolate here but i think this product would really benefit from a makeover which included a new coati doubt these are easy to find in the uk and to be honest i wouldnt go mad trying to track them down im sure there must be other chocolatiers making much better pistachio creamssounds like your everyday average arabic chocolates alright  however over here in qatar we have now available chocolates under the brand name of patchilebanese in origin which is quite good they do   dark chocolates which are really decentrightthey are no valrhona or even lindt for that matter but still better than your average souq chocolates and have improved over time
in case you dont know them lauden is run by husband and wife team stephen and sun trigg they based in leeds and theyre best known for their fresh tangy flavours and beautifully transferdecorated chocolatesthis year lauden have two special valentines flavours to choose from strawberries  cream left and heather honey both chocolates come in heartshaped milk chocolate shellsthe heartshapes mean that these chocolates dont come in the usual hard plastic cases but slightly less appealing card boxes for a few brief seconds i was a little disappointed but then i remembered i had lauden chocolates and i knew they would be awesomeand of course they are the strawberries  cream is really just about the strawberries and its the zingiest tangiest loudest natural strawberry flavour ive ever had the ganache is made with white chocolate and theres a hint of a creamy note there but this is really about the strawberry i love itthe heather honey chocolate is a little more unusual like the strawberry its a robust flavour but pinning down actual flavour notes is much more difficult its flowery peppery and really quite deliciousi love these chocolates just as i love most things that lauden makes i love how they manage to take fresh natural flavours and make them so intense and delicious that the flavour stays with you long after the chocolate has gone theyd make a great gift for any fine chocolate loveri love laudens chocolates  their fillings have an intensity very hard to find elsewhere at the time of posting its worth pointing out these are not yet available from laudens webshop heres hoping they appear soonyeah theyll certainly appear soon or just call them thanks dom  paul chocolates will be available online this weekendive never experienced strawberry like this absolutely out this world
opening the mint bar youre immediately greeted by the strong aroma of fresh mint i confess to being a little unsure of this as im not the worlds greatest mint chocolate fan its quite difficult to balance such a strong flavour without entirely overwhelming the chocolatethe bar itself is dark and glossy and has a good snap bite into a piece then let it melt on the tongue and your mouth is quickly filled with a fresh natural mint flavour this is something a little different from the average mint chocolate as it actually tastes of fresh mintbut most interestingly you can still taste the actual chocolate after a few moments of intense minty freshness the natural flavour notes in the chocolate start to come through its sweet fruity and really very pleasant indeed its a flavour combination that works surprisingly wellthe milk chocolate is much softer with no real snap scattered throughout the chocolate are tiny pieces of cashew which add as much to the texture of the chocolate as they do to the flavour the cinnamon turns out to be barely noticeable at all the milk chocolate itself is delicious and creamy but the added flavours dont shine through quite as much as i would like its still a great bar but i actually prefer the mint and dark chocolate quite the opposite of what i was expectingthe vietcacao bars are still a bit difficult to get hold of outside of france but if you do spot them i recommend giving them a go id also recommend trying the nonflavoured versions as the vietnamese chocolate is really something quite special in its own righthow do i purchase the vietcacao does the morin factory sell their chocolate in the usa thanksthis is the first i have heard about cacao from vietnam thanks for the post
these truffles were around during the christmas season and were available in three varieties one of which was an orange version i chose the intensely chocolatey version in order to try and capture the essence of the productas you can see moser roths product design leaves a little to be desired  unless of course they were going for that joke shop look its not just the shape of these truffles their colouring makes them a little shall we say comedylooks aside i was keen to see how they tasted  i was not disappointed the first thing to note is that these truffles melt like they were made from raw chocolate that little whirl of chocolate takes about ten seconds to evaporate away like a wisp of cloud leaving behind a small clump of cacao nibs for you to chew on in fact it melts so quickly that its hard to work out how much depth of flavour the chocolate has the nibs are crisp flavoursome  a welcome addition but i wanted to know more about these amazingly light truffles so i started reading the box  and that was where the trouble startedfor one there is no given cocoa percentage its anyones guess how much actual chocolate is in one of thesego back and read that again yep if you eat five of these truffles youre on course for obesity which is wrong very wrongthe funny thing is that once you know whats in these truffles the next time you eat one it just doesnt taste as good as it did when you were in the dark abut the fat content armed with the terrible truth i found myself thinking that the cacao flavours werent that strong which they arent and that the pleasant mouth feel was primarily due to the huge amount of fat in each truffleits for this reason that this review has to be more of a warning than a recommendation its this sort of confectionery that will put your health at risk and thats why i have to say avoid  for the sake of your healththx for the review its so stupid when chocolatiers  chocolate makers add unhealthy stuff to the chocolate in its pure sense chocolate is a healthy treat when mixed with crap it becomes just that crapgreat review its a shame they had to ruin it with so many unhealthy ingredientsty i would never of known wont bother buying there now
so what do we know about the belize bar the country borders guatemala and the organic beans are grown in a lush tropical area that was home to the mayans by a cooperative possibly the toledo cacao growers association who produce the cacao that goes into green  blacks maya gold bars its a typical mast brothers bar with just two ingredients  the cacao and some cane sugar  which allows the full flavours of the cacao to come out its all about the beans and the tasting notes on the packaging tell me im in for raisin plum and sarsaparillafirst impressions were of deep earthy cacao with red fruits and a lot of woody undertones its certainly a bittersweet chocolate but not in the  cacao european way theres a slight bitterness and good acidity and as the chocolate melts these fruity notes give way to more earthy flavours with the bittersweet element persisting throughout the chocolate itself has a slightly grainy texture on the tongue but this isnt carried through when it meltsoverall its a big bundle of quite robust flavours with the promised raisin being the most obvious other flavours i caught were cherry  wood but there wasnt much in this bar that said sarsaparilla to me it doesnt really offer much complexity but if youre partial to bold upfront bittersweet chocolate ten this is definitely worth tracking downnice review just fyi the beans come from maya mountain cacao a social enterprise that sources cacao from smallholders in belize not the association you mention in the text
the result is a ganache that retains all the flavour of the chocolate but without the dairy of course theres nothing wrong with cream ganaches but adding dairy to a chocolate completely changes the flavour with a water ganache you get much more of the natural flavour notes from the chocolate in fact a water ganache can even intensify the flavour as the ganache melts more quickly and covers the tongue more quickly whats even better is that this particular box contains four mini bars of solid los ancons along with the four water ganaches that means you can try both together and really get to grips with how the water ganache changes the flavour and texture of the chocolate i cant think of a better way of presenting a fine chocolate like thisi decided to try one of these little bars first its rather delicious naturally sweet with hints of red fruits very easy to eat and very well balancedmoving on to the ganaches themselves the first thing to note is just how elegant they look beautiful dark cubes with shiny sides and a dimpled top bite into it and let it melt for a couple of seconds and the flavour simply floods your mouth it definitely has the same notes as the solid chocolate bar but those flavours are enhanced massively what comes to the front most noticeably are the red fruits in fact its so fruity that youll probably want to check the ingredients to see what has been added for the record the ganache contains chocolate spring water glucose sunflower oil and sea saltits difficult to say how much the sea salt has lifted the natural chocolate flavour and how much is down to the water but that balance is down to the skill of the chocolatier and its something thats been done perfectly herethe texture of the ganache is ultra smooth and the ganache melts quickly and evenly i suspect the addition of sunflower oil has something to do with this but the texture is never oily so i assume only a tiny amount is useddo yourself a favour and treat yourself to a box nowhi domas a fan of chocolate i might get something from his websitebrought the dominican republic box you reviewed today
so whats new with soma well theyve made a mint bar and they called it mint bar too which makes perfect sense because it is a no nonsense bar of chocolate theyve used milk chocolate which was a bit of a surprise but theyve gone for a generous  which gives it a lovely richness but it is still nice and creamy too it also leaves lots of room for mint too but soma have showed some real restraint and added just enough to get their point acrossits a very subtle minty blend that doesnt overwhelm the chocolate and that makes for an easy eating bar which doesnt stick around for long even those not inclined towards mint and chocolate are likely to be surprised by how well balanced a mix this iscomments are closed
the first thing that stands out about the chocolate is the packaging the two flavoured bars i was sent come in elegant card boxes with charming illustrations on the front except these are actually postcards which you can keep or send  a great way of spreading the word about good chocolatethe back of the boxes feature a window so you can see the chocolate itself in this case the bars are studded with enticingly large pieces of fruit and nuts i couldnt wait to trythe first flavour i tried was pecan and sour cherry as you can see it looks great these bars arent divided into chunks theyre just thick slabs of deliciously dark chocolate that force you to break off big chunks perfectthe chocolate which is the same  cocoa solids dominican republic in all the bars is really really nice its wonderfully smooth with a rich and fruity flavour theres a lot of cocoa butter in there which adds to the smooth texture but thats what i love i could eat this chocolate all daythe fruit and nuts just add to the experience the pecans are deliciously crispy and light and the sour cherries are bursting with flavour that complements the chocolate perfectly i simply love this chocolatemy hazelnut and raisin bar was even chunkier and just as delicious these clearly hand made bars are a massive step up from your average fruit and nut chocolate my preference is for the pecan and sour cherry but thats purely a personal choicealso included in my package of samples was this beautiful looking unflavoured bar the thick paper wrapper is very reminiscent of mast brothers and this bar is divided into chunks but perhaps most interesting of all is the cacao rum and rum liqueur im definitely not a rum reviewer but obviously i had to try them both have a wonderful deep red colour i tried both neat and although theyre rather strong there is a definite hint of cacao in both i think theyd be great in cocktailsunfortunately the rum isnt available in the uk at the moment but the chocolate is links below and i highly recommend giving it a goheres a great video of the cacao prieto chocolate making processdamn literally just got back from brooklyn those bars look beautiful sure i saw the rum in the mast brothers shop now i think about it but didnt have the money to purchasesounds greatoh no youll have to go back i love the packaging of this chocolate and the little rum bottles im sure they taste great too
i blame the pink panther i still remember eating those sickly sweet incredibly pink bars of strawberry confection adorned with his image many many years ago and even though i knew they were probably just sugar fluorescent food colouring and artificial flavours i was very fond of them the whole experience must have gotten lodged somewhere in my head because im a bit of a sucker for strawberry chocolate of any variety so when two different strawberry chocolate bars fell into my lap not literally i was hoping to recapture some of that pantherrelated excitementthe aroma of strawberry is incredibly strong and that is not surprisingly reflected in the taste too  it is a near perfect recreation of strawberries and cream that is just plain yummy it might not rank particularly high on the scale of quality chocolate bars and i could lose a whole lot of my chocablog credibility assuming i have some but i ate the whole thing pretty quicklyif you are just looking for berry undertones then the godiva bar would be your best bet but it was the lindt all the way for me because they absolutely nail the flavour it might not be the most sophisticated bar of chocolate but id happily eat another one right nowi tried the lindt bar last summer and really liked it truly fruity and creamyim with you when it comes to strawberry chocolate i dont want subtle i want strong the lindt bar sounds divinethey both look excellent would love to try themjust tried lindt one best chocolate i have had in my life
thats not really surprising though the first chuao bar i had was spectacularly good but consistency is a huge challenge for any small batch bean to bar chocolate maker each batch is treated slightly differently and a minor difference in the beans or the chocolate making process can have a big effect on the flavour of the finished barthis particular bar has two added flavours  salt and pepper  so minor changes in the flavour of the chocolate might not be quite as noticeable its a difficult combination to get right though salt can lift the flavour of chocolate but too much and it becomes inedible combined with the heat of pepper it would be easy for it to end up being more savoury than sweetas you can see from the photos its an interesting looking bar on one side are the traditional chunks but on the other its covered in flakes of maldon salt and a deep orange alleppo pepper it certainly looks excitingof course with a random scattering of spicing each chunk tastes slightly different but overall the balance of flavours is good the salt comes first then the heat of the pepper builds but never becomes overpoweringdefinitely looks interesting i can never resist an unusually flavoured chocolate bar but youre right the chocolate has to be good quality too great post 
there are no birds angry or otherwise in fazer geisha though despite the bright pink packaging and slightly odd choice of name this is a simple milk chocolate bar with a hazelnut fillingthe filling is essentially a praline but being mass produced there are some vegetable fats in there it has a nice texture being smooth with a little bit of a crunch but it is a touch too sweet for my tastes not so much that i didnt enjoy a square or two at a time but any more than that would have been quite hard goingthis is not designed to be a high end fine chocolate bar though and ultimately i quite enjoyed it for what it is at  for a g bar its decent value and makes a nice change from your regular supermarket confectionery im still not convinced by the packaging thoughi never knew this existed as a bar ive only seen the box of individually wrapped chocolates same format as the vodka chocolatesah yes  i should have said they do individual chocolates as well thanks ana i wonder if that means they do a bar version of the vodka chocolatesone of the best chocolates that i have ever eaten the wrapper reminds me of willy wonker when i was a child for some reason it is so invitingfrom the finnish wikipedia production of geisha chocolate started in  the chocolate was developed by peter fazer by combining milk chocolate with the filling of a popular confectionery product the name geisha is based on the japonais filling in questionhence the name also it probably sounded fancy and exotic at the time
its been a good while since i had any halva blame my declining interest in sweet tasting goods but when i saw this little g box of organic dark chocolate halva i decided it was a good chance for us to be reacquainted if youve never eaten halva the texture may catch you by surprise at first it tends to form into long shards rather like ice crystals and when you first put it into your mouth it feels as though its going to melt away until you chew it and then it gets pretty gooey i had forgotten the way that halva clumps together and having sticky little lumps of it between my teeth transported me back to that first taste again only this time instead of pure halva there was a strong undercurrent of dark cocoa added into the mixi found that the addition of cocoa powder and cocoa mass did quite a lot for the flavour it took away a little of the usual sweetness and added a new dimension to the taste losing a little of the underlying sweetness made this much more enjoyable but the cocoa didnt take over completely so the overall flavour was a pleasant balance between honeyed sweetness and slightly bitter dark chocolate i have to say that i was preparing myself for a sugar overload but was pleasantly surprised so much so that i think if i ever had reason to buy halva again id be looking for this version and the reactions of friends who also tried it would seem to bear that out as it was almost universally acclaimed if youre a regular halva eater have a go at this if youve never tried it i would heartily recommend this chocolatey versioni also like their organic apple juice sweetened one that is my favourite   i do enjoy the texture as well dunno why but i do 
let me first get out of the way what is essentially my only complaint its the packaging while the barks clear bag works as a basic im not as happy with the caramels in another brown box i have no problem with a plain box and no problem with brown perhaps it is the not quite matte not quite shiny finish of the material that im not likingand while raffia can be a handmade finish i would like to see ribbon take its place at some point in the future to create more of a hedonists packaging something more sumptuous but these are the areas for improvement like every company hasa base of dark chocolate with generous swirls of white chocolate forms the candy cane bark topping this base is a field of shredded candy caneshredded quite effectively too the pieces are small and thin enough to crunch on along with the chocolate but not so small that the pop of their flavor and texture disappearswhile most of the bark has a generous coating of candy cane a couple of the pieces which seem to be from the edges of the bark have been left too bare but on the whole this bark is sweet and lightly dark casual and minty in flavor its holiday bark  for sharing or giftingmy box of salted caramels had five each of milk and dark chocolate varieties happily rimmed in gleaming gold where they sat two things youll want to note from the ingredients here pasteurized cream and natural vanilla good now im not sure if i prefer the milkcoated caramel or the dark theyre both very differentthe caramel itself is the chewy kind but done effectively in an oldfashioned kind of style it tastes like vanilla not stiff goo the sweeter milk chocolate blends right in with the caramel whereas the dark chocolate enhances the caramels stiff side rather than its sweet side its like a riesen turned handmade in both cases the flaky sea salt adds just the right amount of interest to the pairingboth of these products are at comfortable levels right now and you wont be getting complaints if you choose to gift either one personally im wondering if hedonist is aiming more for the handmade side or the artisan side  or the level where the two intersect but while i ponder the philosophy of chocolate branding ill just finish off the second half of those caramels and another piece or two of candy cane barkcomments are closed
what arrived at my door was this rather cute box packed with goodiesthe biggest item in the box is this fun snowman it has a handmade  and to be honest home made  feel about it its a little silly but i still quite like itthe surprise was cutting into it and finding a whole apple rather than some cakey surprise i didnt have any description of the items and i have to admit i was a little disappointed to find something so healthyhaving said that the juicy apple was a rather nice counterpoint to the sweet white chocolate and the flavour worked quite wellalso in my box of goodies were long thin snowmen on sticks and pretzels dipped in chocolate and covered in hundreds and thousandsi was a little concerned about what vegetable might form the centre of the snowmen but these ones are filled with a soft and slightly chewy marshmallow needless to say theyre very sweet but i did manage to scoff a whole onemy surprise favourite from the box was the pretzel sticks which have a very nice crunch and a good balance of sweet and salty they look quite christmassy tooobviously these are aimed at kids more than they are at me but i still quite enjoyed them if youre in harvey nichols its certainly worth a look to see whats on offercomments are closed
so i was very happy to get my hands on a slender box of godiva limited edition holiday truffles for those reasons but also because it has a trio of special seasonal offerings which sounded interesting the other  of the box was taken up by two of their mainstays  a milk chocolate truffle and a couple of dark chocolate truffles which ive had many times before theres really nothing wrong with them at all but i was all about those seasonal ones heres my thoughtsnot a bad mix at all and those seasonal varieties are what really makes this worth searching out or rather would make it a lovely gift to receive so you should probably start dropping really unsubtle hints immediately they look superbe x
i find myself in the unusual position of having to write this review without any of the product in front of me i did have some as you can clearly see from the photos but they disappeared ive no idea where they went i guess someone must have eaten themcomments are closed
if you live in the uk theres a very good chance youve heard of keith valentine graham aka levi roots he first appeared on british tv show dragons den with his reggae reggae sauce and was an immediate hit successfully selling his idea and getting backing from two entrepreneurs fast forward six years and mr roots is a multimillionaire and as one might expect his sauce is being marketed quite aggressively with new variants ready meals and snacks appearing on supermarket shelvesi spotted this bar in one of those novelty shops that sell whistling key rings remote control helicopters and dad gadgets price wise its getting close to a premium chocolate brand with this g bar retailing at a whopping  thats a pound an ounce folks and my curiosity was piqued as to whether this was going to be worth the money or an overpriced novelty aimed at people stuck for something to buy a difficult male friend or relative or challenge a matereading the back of the box didnt exactly fill me with confidence if you ask me milk chocolate with  cacao is never going to be great i was beginning to form a picture of what this bar was about and it wasnt goodthe first square allowed enough of the chocolate flavour out for me to ascertain that its cheap overly sweet confectionery theres plenty of fire in there though as the second square confirmed by pieces three and four it was all about the chillies which is probably a good thing and also part of the plan  if we shove enough chilli into this nobody will know the chocolate is awful and after four squares i was completely over the whole business bar a persistent chilli burn going on in my mouththis bar typifies whats wrong with gifting chocolate  overpriced poor quality rubbish wrapped in familiar branding im pretty sure i could come up with something better using dried chillies and proper chocolate the only thing i cant do is package it so that gullible punters are attracted to itavoidunless those two issues are addressed i think the product may find its way being withdrawn from sale
this chocolate cocoa pod is no exceptionthe shell of the pod is made from  milk chocolate with a dark and white chocolate decoration painted onto the mould so it really does look good they chocolate is very pleasant and at  its not too sweet its a big step up from the chocolate you often find in these kind of seasonal giftsinside the pod is a bag of  chocolates including chocolate shapes in milk dark  white chocolate sea salt caramels and my favourite  fizzy puddingsthese christmas pudding shaped chocolates contain a praline subtly flavoured with orange and spices and a little bit of popping candy to give it a fizz theyre great funthe sea salt caramels are made with cornish smoked sea salt theyre nice but i have to admit they were a little too sweet for me generally that means that the average chocablog reader will love them though at  its not the cheapest christmas gift but its made from quality ingredients and weighs a hefty g  this of course is just one item from chococos christmas range so its worth having a look around their website to see what else is on offercomments are closed
as you can see these look like large open mince pies theres a layer of brownie on top and mincemeat underneath although they layers arent particularly distinctof course the important thing is the taste and thats where these dont quite work for me theyre pleasant but they dont have the rich fruity flavour of a mince pie or pauls simnel brownie for that matter and theyre also not particularly chocolatey the brownie is more cakey than the usual paul a young offering and when combined with the pastry its just a little dry for my tastei dont think they look as good as they could either that may not seem important but im used to everything i buy from paul a young looking drop dead gorgeous and that feeling of luxury and indulgence is why im prepared to pay a premiumthis is as much down to personal taste as anything else though i know as many people that claim to hate mince pies as i do people who love them im in the latter category but these dont evoke my own childhood mince pie memories neither do they have they intense chocolate flavour and wow factor of paul a youngs amazing indulgent brownies i think in this case id rather have the two separately i will certainly be buying some of pauls chocolates as gifts this year but i dont think it will be thesecomments are closed
the most noticeable thing about this is that it really is rather large at cm over  feet in length its a good job it comes in a box with a carrying handle because it really would be quite difficult to transport otherwise and yes it still looks like youre carrying some kind of weapon when youre walking down the street with itthe sheer size of the thing also means its quite difficult to photograph which is why ive used the official product shot as well we generally like to use our own photos rather than marketing images so you get a better idea of what the product looks like in the real world in this case even the official photos dont really do it justiceof course being a christmas cracker only the central portion is filled but you do still get a hefty g of chocolate insideyou might be expecting this just to be a giant crackershaped box of chocolates but it is actually a functioning christmas cracker complete with banger i strongly suggest you dont pull it over the christmas dinner table though as there are  chocolates  party hats and an envelope filled with very bad christmas jokes insidethe chocolates are wrapped in pairs and as with the previous version we reviewed theres a lot of alcoholic chocolates in there the good thing is that they are clearly marked so you can easily pick your favourite flavours out or avoid the alcohol without having to open every chocolatethe chocolates are typical hotel chocolat they might not compare with the fresh chocolates you buy from your local chocolatier but theyre pleasant enough and packed with interesting flavours im not going to review each one as theres far too many and i may not survive trying every single flavour if youve ever had a box of hotel chocolat chocolates youll know what to expectthe cracker costs  which isnt cheap but it is a fun alternative to more conventional individual christmas crackers and can make a great centrepiece decoration with the contents being shared theres no arguing over who gets the most interesting toy inside their cracker which is a definite plus on the downside the cracker jokes are just as bad ill spare you thosecomments are closed

one had freezedried raspberries in it but it was their wittilytitled rosemary baby bar which i really likeda trip to my current favourite chocolate shop revealed that denman island had added a new bar to their range  alto el sol it is a special limited edition made with beans from a single plantation in peru and it stands out from the other bars they produce for a couple of reasons firstly it has a wonderfully colourful wrapper rather than the monochrome look all the other ones have secondly it is more expensive the bars arent that big in the first place  just g  so adding an extra dollar to the price does appear to be a little on the steep side but that could all be forgiven if the chocolate is stunning or at least tasty and it is a rather tasty bar of chocolate it tastes like a single origin bar thanks to its robust flavour which starts off strong with dark earthy tones and then shifts into vanilla and for some reason a hint of bananas the ingredients reveal that the chocolate is  leaving a little too much room for the cane sugar for my tastes it turns out that vanilla has been added rather than coming from the chocolate itself but it isnt overdone while the other denman island bars ive had definitely benefitted from the flavourings theyve had added alto el sol doesnt need that i do think that the next batch should be ramped up by at least another  in the cocoa solids department to balance out the sweetness but it is still the best bar that denman island chocolate have made to date can you explain the vanilla being added rather than coming from the chocolate im unclear on the difference in the processits callebauts chocolate
we dont often write about white chocolate here primarily because its mainly sugar and generally has no real flavour to speak of willies cacao el blanco is a little bit different thoughfor the uninitiated white chocolate is generally made from four ingredients sugar cocoa butter milk powder and vanilla its often so packed with sugar that its difficult to eat more than a single square and when you do it has little or no flavour any flavour there is comes from the vanillawillie has taken a different approach with his white chocolate hes using single origin venezuelan cocoa butter and sugar is at the bottom of the ingredients list rather than the top hes also taken the vanilla something that is generally used to cover up bad flavours out entirely so you can actually taste some of the flavour of the venezuelan beansnow dont get me wrong this is still very much a white chocolate but its one that you can happily eat without making yourself sick just break off a small piece and let it melt on you tongue its sweet of course but you can actually taste something other than sugar and vanilla its fresh light and creamy the notes on the back of the g box say this chocolate is perfect for desserts and decorating cakes im sure thats true but its even better just to eat it on its own its easily the nicest white chocolate ive ever hadwhether youre a white chocolate lover who wants to switch to something a little less sweet or a sceptic who usually avoids white chocolate at all costs this is a bar you should try for yourselfsure its just a white chocolate but its a white chocolate made by someone with a passion for real chocolate and natural flavours highly recommendedcomments are closed
as a child i loved advent calendars it didnt matter so much about what the treat behind each door was it was purely the anticipation and surpriseits been a long time since ive had an advent calendar myself primarily because i expect more from my chocolate than the cheap pieces of greasy milk chocolate that generally fill them so i very happy to learn that valrhona had produced an advent calendar this yearthere now i feel bad for having told you but you would have found out anywaysuffice to say theyre all quite tasty and a cut above the average advent calendar treatbut at the same time theres no escaping the fact that this really isnt very christmassy the only real nod to christmas is some simple decorations on the sightly flimsy box and although you dont know which square youre going to get on any given day apart from christmas eve it also lacks the element of surprise those chocolate squares just arent different enough to make it excitingperhaps this is a calendar for those who just like good chocolate and arent that fussed about quirkily shaped chocolate but i think  is a lot to pay for g of valrhona its good but it doesnt feel like a great amount of effort has gone into making a truly festive product and neither does it have the luxury feel that would set it apart from the crowdwheres dulcey
when you think of chocolate producing countries vietnam may not be the first place that comes to mind but its rapidly establishing a name for itself in the world of fine chocolateafter visiting a cocoa plantation and retuning with some beans they decided to have a go at making chocolate themselves using instructions downloaded from the internet needless to say the first attempts didnt go particularly well but with more research practice and investing in some locally built machinery just a short time later theyre producing chocolate to rival the best in the worldsamuel and vincent source their beans from different regions across the country each region produces its own bar and each one has a different cacao percentage chosen to suit the particular flavour characteristics of the different beansas you might have guessed this particular bar is made from beans from the tin giang province in southern vietnameverything about this bar is an experience inside the thick beautifully printed paper wrapper the chocolate is covered in a simple and elegant gold foil open it up and youre greeted with a deliciously warm and spicy aromait looks as good as it smells too with a very pretty diamond pattern and the marou logo embossed into the bar it almost seems a shame to break into itthe flavour is rich and dark making the bar seem a little stronger than  cocoa solids those warm spices are also there in the flavour along with a sweet fruitiness the tasting notes on the wrapper also mention honey but thats quite a subtle note in this robust bari love this chocolate its the kind of bar where you just need a small piece let it melt slowly and experience the flavours but to get a real flavour of vietnam i recommend picking up a few of the other bars in the range and tasting them together youll be amazed at the variety of flavours that can come from the beans of just one countrywe also loved the packaging but we didnt really fell in love with the taste a bit too citrusy and bitter well have to try another one 
this rather lovely packaging caught my eye when i was away a few weeks ago the old fashioned shade of green and elegant gold script made this double pack of g cte dor gianduja bars stand out a mile from the assorted other bars that surrounded it it smacked of tradition and a sort of olde worlde refinement that made me want to see what was insidethe chocolate itself is classic belgian  cacao milk chocolate smooth and sweet with the buttery rich gianduja filling melting rapidly over the tongue its timeless stuff done by every belgian chocolate house and a heck of a lot of other companies as well its also fairly difficult to distinguish it from any one of a dozen other belgian praline  gianduja chocolates other than by the retro wrapperin short its a timeless classic chocolate bar well two actually presented in a very elegant old school package which elevates it to special treat or gift item instead of yummy snack well worth it if you find one but offering nothing surprising or outstandingi agree that the packaging looks quite pretty also very classy
so what makes the chocolates so special well its all about the flavours theyre both delicious and uniquely japanesethe chocolates are from right to left in the photo below madagascan criollo fukinoto japanese butterbur shoots pralin japonais sesame praline sak japonais made from the solid sediment left over from sake brewing and ninja infused with smoked cherry woodmadagascan criolloi started out with what should be the simplest chocolate   an unflavoured ganache made with madagascan criollo beans except this is far from simple its a deep rich and fruity ganache that has a bit of a kick to it it has a wonderfully smooth texture and a flavour that builds from sweet and fruity to intensely chocolateyfukinotopralin japonaisa praline made with sesame seeds rather than hazelnuts and not just any sesame seeds either these are local golden sesame sesame seeds kingoma that taste amazing im not usually a praline fan but i could eat these chocolates all day such a shame theres only one in the boxsak japonaisi have to admit i know nothing about the sake making process but im told sakekasu is the solid sediment left over from the brewing process in this chocolate the sakekasu is split into two layers the bottom layer is combined with caramel and white chocolate and the other with the top layer is combined with madagascan dark chocolate the resulting flavour is as wonderful as it is unique its soft caramelly and mildly alcoholic in flavour but like the other chocolates in this collection the flavour of the filling never overpowers the chocolateninjaclearly this is the best possible name for a japanese chocolate and as you might expect its a bit special inside the ecuadorian dark chocolate shell is a milk chocolate thats infused with a cherry wood smoke that overwhelms the senses this isnt some artificial smoke flavour but one so natural that its like being in the centre of a raging bonfire a hint of sea salt just intensifies the flavour yet as quickly as it appears it fades no wonder this chocolate is named for the smoke bombs ninjas used to escape their enemies as the smoke fades youre left with just the deep chocolate flavour and the memory of that intense wood smoke and then its goneand with that this simple box of chocolates has disappeared too it is uniquely japanese with a healthy dose of french style and is something you really should try if you can get your hands on it unfortunately you may have to visit japan to do so i think its worth the tripoh my these sound divine now how does one track down a ninja d
i mentioned that splendids turkeys might be something for guests to take home but those were unwrapped turkeys and needed to be put in a small bag to be brought home all three of these turkeys which i christen godiva sweet and madelaine come already wrapped in foil that makes things simpler plus since these are all sold separately you can buy however many you need or want without having to work with the number that come in a boxas for the numbers godiva is a  oz  turkey sweet is  oz and  and madelaine is  oz and  assuming they were priced the same way but all  oz sweet would be  and madelaine would be  so sweet is the least expensive and godiva is the mostthere is a direct parallel between foil shininess and turkey size godivas foil is closest to matte giving it a more refined air madelaines high shine sends it into the candy category of the three i want to say that godiva would look nicest on a semiformal thanksgiving table except for a couple of key points while in resting position it is the only one to show lettering the ingredients are listed on both sides of the rail and one side of the foot section says godiva while the other marks that this is a  oz milk chocolate none of it is hugely prominent but it sort of ruins the effect for me nonetheless sweet instead carries a collar on his neck thats attached to a tag with the company and ingredients info it can be left on or easily removed before setting the turkey to decorate place settings madelaine just has a simple sticker on the back where the foil edges come together the other difficulty with godiva is the slight bump on the bottom part where the two pieces of attach sweet has this too but not to so great a degree it doesnt keep godiva from standing but would make him fall more easilyas i began unwrapping the turkeys i was once again reminded of what a horrible person i am after i adopted godiva at the mall i put him in my purse while going about to some other places for the rest of the daynow he appears to have melted slightly and taken on the pattern of the foil i would regret this more if godivas own pictures of the turkey dont seem to show a terribly detailed mold anyway not say like sweets mold i wasnt sure what to think of the bright colors of sweets foil but hes molded beautifully every feather is clear and there are many the two halves of the turkey come together in a very fine line finer than godivas there isnt much to say about madelaine he barely even looks like a turkeydespite all three being milk chocolate turkeys there are still flavor distinctions madelaine comes out the weakest with both a low cocoa content and quality it isnt compounded chocolate but it does have artificial vanilla godivas standard milk chocolate is very sweet maybe even more than madelaines though in a different way i enjoy it every so often as an indulgent thing sweet ironically is the least sweet of the threewhich you must not take to mean that it isnt sweet it just has more to it the caramel notes move into a milky richness and it becomes a decent chocolate affair so what kind of chocolate turkey do you want if you want tiny ones to put on the kiddie table the madelaine chocolate company works if youre giving gobbling gifts godiva will serve i would recommend either godiva or sweet works if youll be putting these on your thanksgiving table it depends on what colors work better for you and also what size you want the smaller  oz offering is more likely something guests will finish at the table whereas the  oz size is probably one to take home along with leftover pumpkin pie anyway does godivas foil design really even look much like a turkeyoh wow now thats an impressive chocolate turkey thats something i would feel bad about cutting into though it seems it would make a nice centerpiece for even a formal tablethats one beautiful turkeyi was just reading along string of comments on the sees candy website about their chocolate turkeys they have been a tradition for so many families my late aunt always brought them when we werer little and i took over the duty of supplying them to the children in the family its been almost  years with sees turkeys being part of our thanksgiving
paul has long been one of my favourite british chocolatiers his talent for balancing flavours and and matching them to the chocolat blend is second to none thats why i was particularly intrigued to try his new christmas pudding chocolate at the shopits a large dome shaped chocolate and as you can see its beautifully finished its almost a shame to bite into it almostpaul has managed to capture the flavours of a christmas pudding perfectly its rich deep and fruity without being overpowering  you can still taste the chocolate best of all unlike a lot of christmasthemed chocolates this one isnt loaded with booze theres just a hint of the christmas spiritive always loved the fruity flavour of christmas pudding and for me this chocolate captures it perfectly i love it and could happily eat these all dayyum skelligs chocolate also do a delicious christmas pudding truffle 
in another typically european move this dark chocolate has only  cocoa solids making it more bittersweet than truly dark like many eastern european chocolatesas you can see the bar has been made using a rather lovely design with the gustavs name imprinted squarely in the middle flip it over and those fat juicy sour cherries are all too evident and obviously added by hand the positioning and size of the cherries and the fact that the bar is moulded as a single slab without dividing lines means that when it comes to tasting the only thing to do is to break off a hunk and get stuck init wasnt hard breaking off a piece with a cherry in it and from my point of view this is definitely the best way to enjoy this bar the sweetness of the chocolate is offset beautifully by the sharp tangy cherries which have retained some of their moisture and are quite chewy which means that the initial sweet chocolate flavours are countered by that cherry sourness as soon as you decide to bite down on the fruitwere it not for the inclusion of the cherries i think i would be looking a lot less favourably on this particular bar the chocolate is smooth and light with quite robust flavour but of course  cocoa means  other stuff including sugar so the true character of the chocolate will always be masked without the cherries there to liven things up this would just be another bar of average forgettable chocolateawesome great info for a chocolate fan like me im going to try and get some to sell
it is hard to believe that there was a time in my life before chocablog but there was and in those days i wasnt seeking out chocolate quite as obsessively as i do now and when i found myself in denver a few years back i did see a lot of hammonds candies in various shops although most of them were of the colourful hard candy variety rather than chocolate i sampled a few but they didnt really make too much of an impressionreally this isnt the kind of chocolate that you eat because of the specialness of the chocolate its something you eat because it puts a smile on your face so it succeeds simply because it made me happy there may have been a little bit of giggling involved this is a perfectly acceptable bar of chocolate that delivers what it promises and thats not a bad thing although im thinking the novelty would probably wear offcomments are closed
its been a while since we reviewed anything from james chocolates so when they offered to send some new samples i wasnt going to refuse randomly picked from the small selection they sent for review are these sizeable salted caramel honeycomb ballsi say sizeable as the eight balls in this g pack are over an inch across so not something you would want to eat in one go yeah i triedthe balls themselves are mainly honeycomb which is then dipped in chocolate and coated with caramel and sea salt ive had plenty of honeycomb and plenty of salted caramel but i dont think ive ever had this particular combination beforeafter a second or two the caramel flavour starts to come through and this is where it gets a little bit too sweet for my tastes crunchie lovers with a very sweet tooth will no doubt like it but i was really looking for something to cut through the sweetness unfortunately that didnt come from the salt which only comes through at the very end and is a little too salty it doesnt feel like a salted caramel so much as it does caramel and salt separatelythat said its still quite easy to eat i managed to eat three before deciding these really were too sweet for me and had to hide them from myselfnot the most elegant of chocolates but worth a try if you love honeycomb and you want to try something a bit different from the usual cadbury farecomments are closed
the bar itself looks very striking with the added ingredients and flower petals pressed into the chocolate the chocolate isnt too sweet  the usual curse of the white variety  and comes in at a respectable  the addition of turmeric turns the white chocolate a more buttery shade and lurks in the background giving an underlying spiciness which really helps to cut through the richness of the cocoa butterconsidering that  ginger is the featured ingredient it is a little disappointing that less than half the squares actually have a piece of candied ginger  maybe thats just down to the bars being handmade but i did feel cheated when it is present it adds a lovely intense burst of flavour which will leave your tongue tingling what i wasnt so keen on were the roasted hemp seeds because their subtle flavour is drowned out by everything else and that means their sole contribution is texture and they shatter on crunching leaving too many little pieces to get caught between your teethso this is a bar which looks better than it tastes although the main problem is the lack of balance of flavours but with more ginger and less hemp it would be a completely different story 
perhaps i shouldnt have so much fear of a cow appearing in my chocolatebacon has after all been a trend for a while but ive never had a bacon chocolate and beef jerky chocolate sounds even more frightening maybe because i occasionally eat turkey bacon but never eat beef jerky hence it took me days after opening this chocolate and smelling its strong scent to taste more than a small nibbleand while i cowardly put off a proper tasting the bull continued to stare me down when i finally found my courage i observed that the first twothirds or so of a bite were alright the  milk chocolate is a balanced percentage not sweet but still having all the flavorful caramelness then the salt and spices kicked me and i fell over temporarily injured the ingredients for the beef jerky list both soy sauce and worcestershire sauce and the bar also contains smoked paprika i think that there isnt so much of a beefy flavor as there is from the rest of these tastes but it can all be quite powerfulas often happens my second piece still not very big didnt taste so strong and i didnt get the beef jerky aftertaste i got the first time which was a bit disturbing while part of this was certainly me getting used to the flavor the amount of flavor does seem to vary throughout the bar what is either amusing or disconcerting depending on your view is the presence of tiny beef jerky pieces almost like sea salt crystals this is most definitely preferable to large pieces or even medium onesif you were as disturbed by the idea of a beef jerky chocolate let this one go by but if youre adventurous andor a beefjerkyeater give it a try its put together in a balanced way that doesnt mask the chocolate and the quality of the ingredients is estimablei tend to like weird combinations but i think it would be difficult finding just the right combination of spices in the jerky to pair into the chocolate but thats what experimenting is all about and my taste testers never seem to complain too muchthat sounds like  a weird combination i would like to try some so if marmite   chocolate  works why not this one
im not entirely sure why anyone would choose to send anything other than chocolate but there you gothe hamper is a decent size  gets you an attractive reusable gift basket stuffed withim not going to review all the contents of the hamper individually although i do intend to review a couple of the more unusual items separatelyi decided to start by trying the thing i knew i would like the least  the hamlet truffles these long shelf life truffles are made with vegetable fats rather than fresh ingredients and as such arent something i would ever buy myself the box shouts the fact that they contain  cocoa solids but doesnt shout quite so much about the coconut  palm oil they were a bit dry and not memorable at all but they werent offensive and im sure the average chocoholic who doesnt spend half their life reviewing chocolate would happily eat themthe oat flips were nice enough and i managed to consume the whole box without noticing the nougat takes the form of a single g bar coated in dark chocolate the chocolate isnt much to write home about but i love nougat and quickly scoffed this barim yet to try the rest of the hamper as theres rather a lot to get throughoverall this isnt what youd call fine chocolate by any means but i do think it represents good value for what it is for under  you can send someone a chocolatey surprise that has a varied selection and will last a long time with next day delivery its great as a last minute gift and although those with a love of artisan chocolate might not appreciate it i think the average chocoholic will probably love itcomments are closed
the whole point of awake is the caffeine and it really doesnt scrimp in that capacity theres mg of caffeine in each bar which is slightly more than a small can of red bull or a cup of coffee so thats enough to give a decent jolt especially since it is squeezed into a g bar so it lives up to its name the bar is rather cute with the owl from the wrapper showing up again on the chocolate plus it also has a notquiterectangular shape too which stops it from being just another bar of chocolate mine were a little worse for wear because of warm temperatures which melted the bars a little but they still looked nice and glossydoes it work it appears to i ate a bar and i felt less sleepy than i did before so for those who dont drink coffee like myself or avoid energy drinks this is a good alternative it costs about double what a standard bar of chocolate does so there is a premium to pay for the caffeine but it is probably worth it for those needing some extra productive hours comments are closed
there is just a single seemingly tiny difference between them the bar on the right has had the beans turned twice during the fermentation process the bar on the left has had the beans turned three timesfor the uninitiated when cocoa pods are harvested they are cut open and the cocoa beans and surrounding pulp are fermented for a period of days in large containers every few days the beans get turned to ensure an even fermentation after the fermentation process has completed the beans for both bars are processed in exactly the same way so why on earth has friisholm gone to the trouble of creating two chocolate bars that to all intents and purposes are exactly the sameyou could consider it a simple experiment but i like to think its to illustrate a simple point namely that every single step of the chocolate making process has a tangible effect on the finished product some people may consider that factors like terroir cocoa bean genetics or roasting time have only a minimal effect on taste but friisholm has made two quite different chocolates by changing the simplest of parametersthe flavours of the two bars are quite noticeably different the tasting notes on the twice turned bar describe it asfull body nutty black olives spicy and complex very smooth finishthis turned out to be my favourite of the two bars ive never been good at articulating flavour notes but this certainly had the more complex and interesting flavourthe triple turned bars tasting notes saystraight almost simple classic chocolate flavour good pronounced acidity distinct notes of black olives and citrus peelthis is an accurate description the flavour is much simpler and more gentle than the twice turned bar the underlying deep chocolatey flavour notes are present in both bars but the chocolates themselves are quite differentboth bars have an ultra smooth texture and are very approachable i would happily buy either of them but they are most interesting when purchased together tasting both bars together you can really appreciate the difference that a single change in the chocolate making process can haveit also serves to emphasise the skill of the chocolate maker and the importance of having a direct connection with the cocoa farmer without that connection friisholm would never have been able to make these bars what a fascinating post thank you so much for the succinct explanation of friisholms process i shall look forward to tasting his chocolate
checking their web site kixocolatl seems to be a belgian  mexican chocolatier because there are quite a few products in the range i thought it best to review half now the other half will follow a little latercrunchy cocoa nibs in a chocolate seem to have become fashionable in the last few years and some are better than others  in some cases the nibs kind of just disappear in the chocolate becoming a kind of hard  crunchy texture but where the flavour is difficult to determineso it is nice then to have something completely different these cocoa beans would seem to be pieces of a cocoa bean roasted and coated in a  milk chocolate a little like a coffee bean coated in chocolate except it is coated cocoa piecesthe first thing to notice about these little marvels is the size small  smaller than a pea eating just one is not possible  its best to pour a handful and snuffle them down but then wait let the flavour develop the milk chocolate coating is quite sweet  but pleasantly so not excessively theres also a slight fruity flavour that reminds me of a good aromatic plum or apricot jam as this melts away the harder cocoa bean is left crunching it up reveals an unusual texture  normal for cocoa beans but unusual nonetheless along with a subtle burst  of a deeper more complex cocoa flavour and slight bitterness which wells up rushes past and then slowly fades and lingersi took these in to the office and plonked them on the table during a meeting it was interesting watching the reaction the dark chocolate hater went back for more and one of the other chaps kept scarfing them down as kids would lollies at the end of the meeting his remark was i could eat the packet in a sittingthis is one of the best cocoa bean  cocoa nib products ive triedthis  chocolate contains pink peppercorns i dont actually know what they are but they certainly give this chocolate a quite strong slightly peppery fruity aroma when  tasting the unusual flavour really jumps outa quick diversion into peppers i take pepper to be a generic term which includes chillies and capsicum as well as the better known white and black pepper from peppercorns in this chocolate the pepper is reminiscent of a good freshly ground black pepper but more subtle more aromatic and quite a lot more fruitythe combination works  unlike many eating chocolates where its possible to scarf down a block at a sitting through sheer greed the stronger flavours here encourage moderation and eating it slowly some might not like the flavour  but i do  but in smaller doses this is one i took to a meeting in the office as well talk about mixed reaction i had one hmm not sure another ok but not to my taste and the dark chocolate hater kept going back for more and more  she loved itif you want something interesting an unusual hunt this downthis one comes with a mystery it is sugarfree and uses our old friend maltitol as the sweetening agent  at the same time it is certified organic  how can one have organic maltitol  perhaps the organic thingy just applies to the other ingredients  whichever way it seems a bit incongruousthis is also the biggest disappointment  the chocolate is quite pale and at  cocoa its fairly mild and unchallenging i cant call this a bad chocolate but neither does it have anything which leaps out and shouts at me in excitement it is just a plain bar of milk chocolate the others are betterglad you enjoyed the nibs might pop another one in when i send you the new bar cheers
after spending far too long looking for the underground wine shop we eventually found it just in time to sample some patisserie and hear william talk about his chocolate how he works and the relationship with laurentperrier champagneas you may know most champagne truffles that you can buy are actually made with marc de champagne its very rare to find chocolates made with real champagne i believe thats partly a cost issue and partly down to the difficulty of working with the ingredients chocolate and champagne not natural bedfellows and it takes real skill to get them to work well togetherthese chocolates are not like the powerful alcoholfuelled marc de champagne truffles you can buy from other retailers they are subtle when we tried them on monday evening we all commented that we could barely taste the champagne at all that of course was because we happened to be eating strongly flavoured pastries and drinking glasses of laurentperrier at the timegetting our sample box home and trying them in the morning the champagne is much more identifiable its still very subtle but its definitely theretheres a nice hint of the fresh cream in the ganache and a finish that leaves you with the essence of the champagne its certainly not a chocolate that you want to have after a strongly flavoured meal and in actual fact id recommend tasting this separately from the laurentperrier champagne that its sold with too its completely delicious but those flavours are easily overwhelmedcomments are closed
unlike some this is a distinctive mold one i have only seen once before after much trawling through my old chocolate pictures finally i discovered a little and lonely picture from nearly three years ago featuring the hageland dark chocolate i picked up at walmart comments on that post revealed that the people behind hageland also provide the chocolate for the whole foods brand this bar may not after all be related but im nearly positive that it isthere are three things to learn from the ingredients list the cocoa content is  the ingredients overall dont look bad and it is only organic natural vanilla flavor that flavors the chocolate hmm the bars appearance is perfectly fine and it has a fairly long melting time for a milk chocolate also are its flavors a step more developed than some layered containing hints of other notes i cant quite place the mouthfeel is very smooth possibly too smooth but at least it isnt a very greasy barwhatever its origins this bar is worth its couple dollar price tag fair for life and organic certified  grams and satisfyingly sweet it certainly wont be your worst chocolate purchaseim beginning to feel like all trader joes chocolates are great mysteries it would be an interesting study to identify all of themwhich i imagine would take some time and effort considering how many companies weve all brought up as possibilities for their different bars in any case hageland and cachet seem to be owned by the same person or to have some such connection
its made by grinding the cocoa beans cocoa butter and cane sugar just the way normal chocolate starts out but where a chocolate bar would be further refined tempered and moulded this is just packaged up after that initial grinding the result is a product that varies in consistency from powder to flakelike chunks its very rough and for me thats its beautythose big clumps contain so many fine chocolate particles and so much air that the moment you put one on your tongue it melts away to almost nothing it has a sweet slightly fruity and very chocolatey flavour it really would be very easy to just take a big spoon to the tin and eat giant mouthfuls of the stuffhowever i still think the best way to eat this stuff is out of the tin with a spoon thats how im going to finish off the rest of this tinsounds gorgeous thank you i bought this product in the shop on the gran sablon and didnt know what the heck to do with it its been sitting taunting me for weeks
i must admit that i have had this pair of chocolates waiting for quite a long time but i have heard their tears of neglect and responded that its better late than neversince this was a new company i wanted to try both the milk  cocoa solids and dark  bars their cocoa contents sit in place of logos on the rectangles of chocolate since the numbers are wrapped in circles the whole effect looks like something related to a railroad and i dont mean this in a necessarily bad way lets just ignore the great amount of bloom on the dark chocolate shall wethe milk chocolate has plot lines of confectionary chocolate but tastes more solid possibly because its cacao percentage is a little higher it doesnt fall flat but doesnt have abundant flavor notes either just the standard caramel notes its alright as i began to anticipate the dark chocolate is of what i call the nesquick brownie thickdark variety where the bitter and sweet have been meshed into one element that ends up being neither yet it isnt as sweet as similar varieties tend to be its also alright fortunately i cant sense anything wrong about the texture without looking at the chocolate i dont think i would know it was as old as it isthe confectionary theme i mentioned is present because confections are in fact what bissingers focus on they sell chocolatecovered fruits truffles and the like most of the saint louisbased companys recipes are from a family cookbook dated  and the familys confectionary roots go back to france some years before that so i suppose despite my own disinterest in caloriecounting chocolate an  gram bissingers bar wouldnt be the worst choice if youre craving chocolate but dont want to over indulge this is simple chocolate that some might pass over quickly but others will return tolooks delicious i would so love to try some
the chocolate is made with aquarivas reposdao tequila and kalamansi and sweetened only with organic agave syrup in fact its you could say this is a cocktail in chocolate form the chocolate in question is a  madagascan but paul tells me that this will switch to a pacari raw ecuadorian chocolate very soonits a simple and elegant chocolate but one that has a little bit of bite hiding under the surface for a tequila chocolate its surprisingly smooth but theres a definite alcoholic kick to it which is only enhanced by the kalamansi its sharp citrussy and very slightly bitter but not unpleasantly soi bought a few of these chocolates to share amongst some friends at dinner and the reaction was pretty much the same from everyone a reaction that can probably best be summed up as mmmm oooh oh the texture of the filling is soft and smooth without being liquid the flavour is smooth but intensely citrussy theres definite kick to it but its something that builds slowly rather than slaps you in the face the flavour of the chocolate is somewhat lost amongst the other flavours but you do pick it up at the end as the soft filling melts quickly the madagascan chocolate is a touch too sweet for the other flavours but im sure the switch to the raw pacari chocolate will help make this a more rounded experience its a chocolate known for its green grassy flavour notes and something that i think will work really well with the natural botanical notes in the tequilawhoa that looks tasty it reminds me of a chocolate truffle called lindt lindor i really want one and now i also want a trio was it a frys brand bar that i heard about on the internet it was a biscuit with a toffee topping coated in milk chocolate a bit like a twix but divided into three chunks with a red wrapper and the girl saying triiiiiiiiiiiiiiio maybe it suffered a demise when frys got brought out or something was it nestl that brought them nasty nestl
one of the things we saw being made was these vanilla and dark chocolate marshmallows we had the chance to try these straight off the production line and were lucky enough to receive this box in a little bag of goodies we were given as we leftas chocolate makers go pierre marcolini is a bit special nearly all chocolatiers buy in their chocolate chocolate from large multinational corporations those who actually chocolate from the bean dont generally make filled chocolates from it themselves pierre marcolini does all of this from a compact factory on the outskirts of brussels they source the beans from around the world roast grind conch and refine the chocolate before making it into truffles pralines bars and other noveltiesthese marshmallows are made in giant pillowlike slabs which are then cut into squares roughly an inch across with bladed rollers they then pass through a curtain of dark chocolate which enrobes them in a thin layer before cooling and being enrobed again to double the thickness of the chocolateas chocolate coatings go though its still quite thin it takes no effort at all to bite through the chocolate revealing the fluffy center withintexturewise the marshmallow is closer to a tunnocks tea cake than those bags of cheap pink marshmallows you find in the supermarket its light and fluffy with a delicate flavour its not too sweet and its so light that it quickly melts away leaving only the rich dark chocolatethe chocolate itself is only  cocoa solids but works well with something as sweet as marshmallow i know a lot of people dislike them intensely but i happen to enjoy them as an occasional treat overall its what i would class as highend confectionery rather than serious chocolate but its one of those things thats very difficult to stop eating once you starti was wondering do pierre marcolini sell in offtrade supermarketslooking forward to your response
for those into organic food  this should tick all the boxes  all of the ingredients are certified organic this does push the price up a bit though at around  for  grams this is not a cheap treat nevertheless i took this one along to a quiz night the chocolate was deemed very pleasant and very nutty this was however by the time wed supped on cheese and consumed rather a lot of red wine the gathered opinions of the tasting panel might therefore be considered a little suspect  out of fairness i tried the little that was left properly a few days later when sobriety was regainedthe original opinions were pretty much bang on the money the chocolate is quite soft and represents a very rich quite sweet creamy wellmade milk chocolate the nuts are crunchy and there are a lot of them  unlike some hazelnuts these actually have a decent hazelnut flavour as well  im a darkside dweller not much favouring a milkchocolate but i have to confess that this one is rather moreish  and being one of those european exports with german english french and italian on the back you can probably find this through about half the world from the more specialised organic food supplierscomments are closed
lets get one thing clear from the start this is not the kind of thing i would normally review on chocablog usually i would go out of my way to avoid anything that says chocolate flavour on it but this product is so hideously awful and utterly unnecessary that i felt the need to write about it purely as a warningon the whole the show was great although during my very brief tour i noted that there was more cupcakes and sugarcraft related exhibitors than serious baking related products i think its wonderful that shows like the great british bake off have inspired a whole new generation of bakers but was a little disappointed at the volume of additiveladen sugar products at the showon our way out we were offered a goodie bag which contained which contained various baking related ingredients and then there was this a product that simply should not exist in this or any other universeas you know dark chocolate contains up to  ingredients all of which should be natural cocoa mass cocoa butter sugar vanilla and emulsifier in that order heres the ingredients list for this packageafter all that they probably realised that the resulting mess didnt taste like chocolate any more so they had to add flavourings to itgahi decided to make it according to the instructions melt the sealed packet in a bowl of hot water for  minutes then squeeze it outi didnt want to waste it on a perfectly good cake so i just squeezed mine out onto a plate before leaving it to coolfresh out of the packet it does look vaguely chocolatey theres a nice dark brown colour and a gloss to it but as it sets it develops a lacklustre dull appearance much like a badly tempered chocolate its not very appetising to say the leastbut of course what you really want to know is how it tastes rightwell if youve ever licked lard from the back of a tramps neck that should give you an idea of the flavour i havent done that but it was the image that came to my mind as i sampled a small piece it is truly truly awful its fatty oily and vaguely sweet but there isnt even a hint of chocolate flavour to it it boggles my mind how this product passed any kind of testing and ended up on the shelves it is just disgustingthere is a moral to this story and a reason why i chose to write about this rather than simply ignore itbaking in the uk is huge at the moment the crowds at the cake and bake show are proof of this but while the great british bake off contestants that drew many of those visitors to earls court invariably use simple natural ingredients there are plenty of companies out there capitalising on the baking fad by selling things like this that supposedly make life easier for novice bakers products like this and ready made icing also in our goodie bag are entirely unnecessary and frankly unhealthyif you want a nice dark chocolate topping for your cake simply melt some quality dark chocolate over it or mix it with some fresh double cream and make a delicious ganache covering its incredibly easy and tastes wonderfuldo not under any circumstances buy this or any similar product i genuinely think that the people making and selling this kind of junk should be ashamed and forced to eat it themselveswhat a great post i hate foods which contain stuff which is not natural as you say a bar of chocolate can be bought for as little as p i bet this topping cost a lot more than that people need to be educated to read all labels on food and if they dont recogonise the ingredients as natural then dont buy my pet hate is sugar free which should read pumped with artificial sweetners they taste disgusting and who knows what effects they have on our bodies i would never give to my childrenthis is a great post i cant imagine mary berry tolerating a bakeoff contestant using instant cake coveringagree incredibly easy to make delicious ganache by pouring boiled cream over chocolate pieces  after stirring until all melted cover and place in fridge to cool and thicken approx  hr then cover your cake   use ratio of g plain or milk chocolate to  tablespoons double cream or g white chocolate to  tablespoons double creambravo dom  these sort of additiveladen sugar rush foods should be outlawedwell done dom i was thinking about doing a review myself products like this are just completely out of touch with concerns these days about health and quality and the current way people are thinking about chocolate i personally would be worried about the health issues of eating something like thisits a product that would have been better not to have existed its clearly a marketingdepartment led design with zero concern for quality be warned anyone unlucky enough to buy this pity the ones who have to eat it on a cakeenjoyed reading this article shame you did pass by my stand i think i was probably one of the very very few stands that did not have any frosting on anythingand i thought we had a winner here  and that i could look forward to some easy chocolatecovered treats when the university term begins this year not to mention how easy it actually is to make some decent chocolate frostingthat looks really gross especially the way it sets it looks like a dull plastic blehgross want something nice have a crunchiei was always a big fan of your website seemingly honest reviews and plenty of info on most of my fav chocolates but i just wish you guys did away with sexual innuendos when reviewing productsits not cool specially when you consider how many youngsters are using this site keep it clean peoplewill never cause your popularity to go downer sexual innuendolike the whole tramps neck n lard bit maybe i sound all grandma like but since we do find younger people on this siteit is after all about chocolate i just think its better to do a way with such descriptions just a suggestionthank you all the same for all your hard work cheersyou thought that was sexual oh dearperhaps then the words tramp in your neck of the woods mean diffently from it does over here never mindthat should be wordbrilliant review and i loved the lard and tramp referencethis does sound horrible i prefer the betty crocker ready made frosting they are pretty good and come in many flavors and colors the chocolate ones are the best though specially the triple chocolate fudge chips
i wasnt expecting this to be a normal chocolate bar or even necessarily anything more than a onetime novelty and for better or worse it isnt eitherwhile im more likely to eat tortilla chips than any other kind i do like such flavored nonsense as bbq chips like the bananas in the last bar the chips receive their own description on the card box they are made by the stlouisbased billy goat chip company who use no added preservatives msg or gluten in their chips ive had milk chocolate covered potato chips before but bbq seasonings and  dark chocolate both make the experience differentbut ive tried to give the bar another chancei find that i receive the chocolate much better in tiny nibbles and i mean tiny it packs a flavor punch as strong as anything so moderation is what enables edibility somehow im now enjoying it in a weird divided sort of way set into the semisweet dark chocolate chip pieces give off their light and airy crunch and salty and spiced flavors the spices are obviously not artificialwhich at first only makes them taste more bizarre sitting in chocolate but this does help make the experience unique its something like willingly eating salsa that is just a little too hot for your taste buds not that this is a spicy bar it has a gentle warmth but i think few people would find it spicymany people i expect will have my initial negative reaction and some will move on to find it a fun novelty chocolate wouldnt it be perfect to spring it on people at a barbeque or potluck but if there is anybody who truly enjoys this chocolate just because please leave a commenti would be intrigued to hear your thoughtsas for myself i have since picked up another wild ophelia bar also chosen for its strangeness im now a bit more cautious to approach itwild ophelia is visges dressed down in trash both labels in fact produce garbagewild ophelia is vosges dressed down in trash both labels in fact produce garbagehas anyone heard of the catch bar it is soft caramel and crisped rice covered in milk chocolate and is the best bar i ever tastednow they sound interesting
the cacao is apparently smoked then stone ground with the vanilla and sugar over the course of several days it really couldnt be simpler  and thats what makes mast brothers chocolate so greatthe surface has an attractive glossy appearance with a few scuff marks and scratches that just add to the character and handmade feel of the chocolate theres a very pleasant sweet and chocolatey aroma thats neither too strong or too subtle its just enough to make it impossible to resist breaking off a chunk the moment you open it the texture of the stone ground chocolate is slightly course without being grainy it starts to melt quite quickly releasing its deliciously sweet fruity flavour interestingly neither the smoke nor the vanilla are particularly apparent individually but together they lend a warmth and sweetness to the overall flavour theres a hint of smokiness in the finish but theres really no more vanilla than any other quality chocolate bar its delicate and subtle and for a  bar its very approachable and very moreishthere was a part of me that was hoping for a more pronounced flavour but i still love this chocolate the chocolate makers art is in taking the smoked cacao and vanilla and using them simply to enhance the flavour of the cocoa bean rather than treating them as separate flavoursthis bar was made with an allotment of beans that were poorly fermented  heavily smokeddamaged in the drying the masts then tried to cover them up in vanilla a terribly flawed chocolate the general consensus among usa chocolate connoisseurs is that the mast brothers currently are not quality at all but substandard in almost every aspect
the dark chocolate truffle features a dark shell with a dark truffle centre id hazard a guess and say that in this instance dark refers to a chocolate with a cacao content of around  the european bittersweet style studded with dark chocolate sprinkles  a sort of posh version of he hings you might sprinkle on ice cream the shell lacks real bite and has a dryish texture as it melts the cacao flavours are fairly unremarkable the centre filling is not too sweet a pleasant surprise and blends well with the shell but overall it remained decidedly averagethe milk chocolate version was a milk chocolate shell with a milk chocolate truffle filling was somewhat better but i suspect that had as much to do with the fact that milk chocolate has more sugar and less cacao once again a little more sweet than i would have liked but definitely not unbearably sothe white version is made with the same milk chocolate shell only this time its dusted with small chips of white chocolate  the centre is a creamy coloured white truffle again not as sweet as it could have been and quite tolerable given my lack of a sweet tooth these daysin fairness it has to be said that these were not the most expensive chocolates in the shop and the shop was a large supermarket given that they cost only a few euros they managed to mainly exceed my expectations and while they are never going to blow you away with sophisticated flavours they do offer decent munching chocolate at a reasonable price that said i will not be rushing to see if i can find more next time i head eastchocolates look yummythey look wonderful   mine never look that good   loltara lidell
when i was a child mum would occasionally make rocky road this was always a delightfully sticky mess where by a process of heating and mixing with other things cooking chocolate was magically transformed into something delicious and specialwhen made the rocky road was placed in an old cleaned icecream container in the fridge to be served up if we kids were good or if it was a special occasion  there was usually quite a lot in an icecream container so i used to sneak in and break lumps off to eat surely nobody would ever notice if a little disappeared  sorry mum secret is out now  of course mums are not as stupid as children think of course she knewa hunk of bracegirdles rocky road is about g and will set you back  the chocolate is some unspecified belgian milk variety and is quite sweet running down the ingredients list there are also dried apricots roasted almonds marshmallows and raspberry lolliesthe one i dont remember from way back when is the dried apricots but i think its a nice touch the overall result is sweetness with lots of milk chocolate the gooiness of the marshmallows and the nuts give a pleasant crunch the dried apricots dont really stand out but contribute to the texture and that huge hit of sugar mercifully there dont seem to be a lot of the raspberry lollies  things which i think are somewhat overratedas far as a rocky road goes its pretty good very sweet but thats how they are meant to be  it compares well with the memories of the perfection that mum used to make when i was about apart from the milk chocolate there is not really a great deal of resemblance to a real rocky road the fudge centre contains sugar condensed milk glucose syrup maltodextrin vegetable fat butter roasted peanuts desiccated coconut and compound white chocolate that makes for a lot of sugarfor those with a sweet tooth this is very pleasant eating the chocolate is nothing special either good or bad the fudge centre is very sweet but quite pleasant  i struggled though to find any of the peanuts or coconut in the fudge i even resorted to breaking a piece up into quite small bits to try and find the elusive pieces of white and pink shown on the box without successso very sweet quite pleasant but is it  rocky road  nah  dont think socomments are closed
last week i was invited along to get a sneak peek at their christmas range which has been inspired by a byzantium theme with lots of eastern symbolism and jewel like colours melt will have a range of christmas themed products which well cover closer to the time but one of the interesting decisions they made was not to concentrate too much on traditional christmas themed flavours instead theyre keeping their most popular flavours but presenting them as hand painted jewel like chocolates they have the christmas look but inside are the popular flavours that regular melt customers know and lovei think this is the perfect christmas gift for the slightly conservative notting hill locals who form the bulk of melts customers they want beautiful quality christmas gifts but are less interested in experimental flavoursthe chocolates i have here are part of melts standard range  not in their christmas outfits  but as we havent actually reviewed the fresh chocolate range before i thought now would be as good a time as any of course the first thing youll notice is just how pretty they are each chocolate is handmade on site by head chocolatier chika watanabe and her staff and while theres a lot of different formats they all look beautifulim not going to review each chocolate here but instead just pick out some of my own favourites starting with one of their best sellers  a simple vanilla bonbon in dark chocolate with a sprinkling of pink sea salt on topyou might not think a vanilla flavour chocolate would be very interesting but melt use the whole vanilla pod in these chocolates for an intense fresh vanilla flavour vanilla is often added to chocolate to hide bad flavours so we sometimes forget what a wonderful flavour it can be when its the star of the show the sea salt really lifts the flavour and the dark chocolate shell counteracts some of the sweetness melt also do a version of this in a white chocolate shell but i recommend going for the dark version myselfthe red white  blue gianduja dome was made to celebrate the jubilee  olympics and was interesting as we got to see how they effect is achieved coloured cocoa butter is painted onto the inside of the mould and left to set before another colour is added finally dark chocolate is poured into the mould and the chocolate is made as usual with the design becoming part of the chocolate itself rather than looking like it has been painted on cleveranother of my favourites is the pistachio marzipan as a child i didnt particularly like marzipan but its something ive grown to love lately ive always loved pistachio and when theyre paired together the result is a wonderfully creamy chocolate that works perfectly with the  dark chocolate i could eat these all dayevery other chocolate in this box is made to the same standard but rather than me go on about them i think you should just try them for yourself i highly recommend making the journey to the notting hill store if you can but if not they also have concessions in selfridges oxford street lidgates in holland park and whole foods in kensington plus you can buy them online so youve really got no excusei think pistachio marzipan would be my favourite two of my favourite things ever combined with good chocolate
the problem with my impromptu chocolateseeking was getting the chocolate safely home i had my bike with me and thought the bar would survive a fifteen minute ride home but that was a foolish supposition the edges melted a little and so im unable to evaluate the chocolates shine  yet i rather like its slightly melted design its a clean enough melting that it looks artsystarting with the flavor notes was promising intensely bold irresistibly rich and as dark as it gets with slight notes of black currant in the finish a deep not bitter aroma plays toward the simplicity of ghirardelli breaking apart one of the eight squares reveals a flesh velvety and redtoned like a dense brownie alluringmy second piece only one fourth of a square hit with less initial bitterness since the bitterness was already in my mouth and its bitter barrier only made me wince and grimace again the finish coming like a whispering sigh was the best part perhaps it was a sort of i have conquered and victory is sweet reactionthis isnt the best  or above chocolate i have had but it also isnt the worst im impressed by its textureit held together much better than did lindts offering and i also found it less bitter than that bar add in the two dollar price and easy us accessibility and you have a good deal probably i wont be buying it again any time soon but world market has come out with a great opportunity for trying out a decently made high percentage chocolatecomments are closed
the updated cocoa loco packaging is really rather good the boxes are simple clean and elegant with a little window on the back that shows the chocolate inside  the sunflower seeds and sea salt on the other hand work perfectly the seeds have a wonderful texture and give a slightly nutty flavour to the chocolate and the sea salt does manage to lift the flavour of the chocolate to a point where some sweetness does start to come through the flavour of the bar as a whole does actually change significantly depending on how you eat it if you can resist biting into it and just let it melt away slowly before crunching the seeds you get a lot more sweetness from the chocolate the trouble is all those delicious seeds make it quite difficult to resist munchingcomments are closed
as i said previously its been a while since i tasted chocolate made so simply just two ingredients well three if you want to divide cacao into cacao paste and cacao butter which can only deliver the real essence of the bean from the initial acidity through the developing flavours of red fruits and light licorice to the lingering light clean finish i found myself thoroughly enjoying this and i dont believe this was entirely due to a recent lack of top notch chocolatecomments are closed
basically this is like a gourmet chocolate spread except it is good enough to just eat straight out of the jar with a spoon and i did there are quite a few varieties available including the mint and nib one which goes by the name of innocence  and the one thing that they all have in common is that they are made with natural raw and organic ingredients nothing wrong with that at all the base of all varieties is made with cacoa powder virgin coconut oil honey vanilla sea salt plus some mesquite and maca thrown in because of their supposed beneficial effectsi was sent a jar of the churning point which uses ghee instead of the coconut oil and that adds some additional richness and depth to something which is already rich or to put it another way i didnt need too much of this at one sitting just one spoonful by itself was enough to satisfy my cravings but when i spread it on ice cream or biscotti when i was able to munch my way through more  the little four ounce jar lasted longer than i expected it to but all too soon i was trying to scrape out every last remnant  basically i licked the jar cleanwhile it isnt possible to say what percentage this is the equivalent to the predominant flavour is chocolate  it isnt sweet by any means and also has a wonderful depth of flavour that presumably comes from the mesquite so theres an earthiness that sticks around at the end and suggests just a hint of heat as it all fades awaythe rite chocolate website has all kinds of suggestions of how to enjoy their product including a few strange ones although the cooking ones make the most sense  this could be a great way to add a concentrated dose of chocolately goodness to any recipe but it is the uniqueness of these jars which makes them so appealing because it isnt every day that you find something yummy that you havent come across before lisa maries chocolate is amazing when we visit she treats us to her newest creations and ive loved every single one well worth the moneyreally really like the sounds of these productsand im always drawn to smaller family run companies glad theyre in the states now i hope shipping cross country isnt too badthis is really interesting youre a very skilled blogger
anyone who gets a lot of deliveries will know how annoying it can be to arrange for redelivery of a package that happened to arrive while you were out so when youre buying a gift for someone online the last thing you want is for them to have to go through that kind of hassle knowing that whatever youre buying will easily fit through the letterbox is a huge selling pointas it turned out the baker days cake had me smiling the moment it popped through my letterbox and landed with a thunk on the floor how can anyone resist a package marked private  confidential cakeon opening the box i was presented with some balloons a birthday cake a card and a tin containing the cake the tin is unbranded and reusable and perfectly protects the cake inside the packaging is simple but its clear a lot of thought has gone into making sure that your cake arrives in one piecethe cakes themselves are all a standard cm diameter x cm high you get  little servings from each one which turns out to be perfect either for sharing with a friend of keeping to yourselfthe personalisation takes the form of printing on the soft white icing that covers the entire cake the icing comes down over the base so the cake inside is completely sealed in this helps to keep the cake fresh as well as providing a  large flat area for your design you can choose from one of baker days many templates when designing your cake or even upload a photothink carefully before choosing a photo though there is something mildly disturbing about eating your own facethe cake inside is good  certainly higher quality than i was expecting i went for the double chocchip cake and it was chocolatey and moist there werent many chocolate chips in my cake and of course youre never going to replicate the quality of an artisan or home made birthday cake but i was very happy eat all minethe best part about baker days cakes though is the pure fun factor they may be a little silly but theyre also sure to put a smile on someones faceooh this one looks well thought out on a number of fronts good to know mmm
they come in four flavours cocoa bros dreamy lemon tropical breeze and toffee groove the dreamy lemon flavour is made with white chocolate and the others have  valrhona dark chocolate it has to be said that the most noticeable thing about these little cakes is that they really are very little indeed each cake is just g but they are exceptionally cute id love to see a bigger version although this size is perfect for a little treat that you dont have to feel too guilty aboutthe cakes are divided into two layers with the cakey bit on the bottom and a thick layer of topping above it each box of two comes with a couple of spoons so you can share them on the spot or just put one in your bag to take to work as a midmorning treat i particularly like the fact that the jars are very simple with an easy peel sticker being the only branding this means theyre also great for serving at dinner parties and pretending you made them yourself of coursethe cakes themselves are rich and sweet and if you have more than one you start to see why theyre so small theyre delicious but all you actually need is one little jar my personal favourite was the toffee groove which has a very nice salted caramel topping the cake itself was a little dry which may be by design but id love to see a really dense moist cakes used in theseso expensive tried them at the real food market and was not impressed buy gu save money and have just as good if not better  taste
as you will gather  im impressed clearly a properly trained chef knows all about flavours and it shows in these new additions to the range without further ado lets rip into a description of themf and na modern dark chocolate take on the old standby fruitnnuts in this case the fruit part is inca berry the nut is pistachio and the chocolate is  cocoaanyhow the fn has a very nice crunch in the nuts and actually tastes of pistachio a common failing in fruit  nut chocolate is that  the nuts are often soggy not toasted properly or perhaps are old and nothingy this one is not like that there is a decent crunch and a decent nutty flavout im not sure about the inca berries because i dont know what they taste like by themselves i dont know what to look out for there is a general kind of sweetness  fruitiness which seems to be more than just the chocolate so i think thats them the choice of a  cocoa solids chocolate here is good  less cocoa and it would be too sweet as it is there is a good balance of sweetness and bitternessthis puts your standard bigbrand supermarket fruitnnut to shame i could eat the whole pack in a single sitting but i wont  i have to share it around or the family wont talk to me for a monthkaramelsoft caramel chocolates must be difficult to get right because there are so many examples of bad ones these days it tends to be a flavour i avoid because many seem to lead to disappointment crunchy caramels seem to be the opposite  there are quite a few good examples you can buy cheaply in the supermarket of course crunchy caramels are cheating they make it easy for the manufacturer and last well in storagein this case the chocolate is wrapped around a soft luscious caramel centre that is sweet and seems to be slightly buttery unlike some this is soft but not sticky or horribly gooey and it tastes really good a common failing in caramels is some kind of unpleasant strange flavour which i call chemical thats unfair to all the chemical process engineers out there but many have  something a bit harsh  metallic  unpleasant this has none of that  it is really good example of a decent soft caramel centre how you get it into these chocolate drops and keep it there is a mystery  where i dont want to know the answer just be amazed at the successthis is definitely one for those with a sweet tooth at  cocoa i think it could have gone to a slightly higher cocoa amount just to help offset the sweetness but im a dark side dweller ignore me this is good really goodand although not for sale yet casey also sent a version of this using a chocolate not caramel which is very lightly salted this was stunning  all the normal flavours and then at the end a small lick of saltiness to complete the flavour enhance it and make it linger on and on he should add this to the range as wellsour cherry brandyi can only go wow at this  i was expecting more sourness  from the name  but the flavours of cherry brandy are all there the cherry inside is soft and juicy  the chocolate at  is just right it has enough hardness and crunch to hold in the insides and gives just the right chocolatiness yes there is such a word now that the mix of flavours with the cherries and brandy scream out black forest cake i just need a big dollop of creamthere wont be any issues of these sitting around for too long waiting to be eaten i think this one is a real winner its really clever getting that soft juicy cherry inside the chocolate case and the mix and progression of flavours is incrediblehint of mintive written before about minty chocolate those sandbeyond afterdinnermints have left me fairly jaded when it comes to mint ill take it if its really well executed and want to run a mile from the ordinary or overly sweet muck apart from sticky goo my test of a mint chocolate is when the chocolate has melted and gone how is the aftertaste about  minutes later many minty chocolates seem to have a harsh or slightly unpleasant taste after the good ones dontthis is a good one simple as that the mint is not too strong  there is no monster aroma to knock you over when opening the pack and the flavour is restrained but minty enough to let you know its there there is no nasty aftertaste it just lingers and slowly fades away  oldest son a harsh critic keeps coming past and stealing pieces which pretty much tells all you need to know my faith in good mint chocolate is restoredthank you ashleigh for the great feedback compliments and keeping me on my toesinteresting that they are using cape gooseberry in chocolate  id never have thought of that combination we have them growing on our farm and i used them for a pavlova recently very successfully they are sweettart with quite a fragrant burst of flavour so quite a powerful presence usually would like to taste them with the pistachios and good chocolategooseberrys and chocolate sounds like the perfect combination i cant wait to taste thatlooks really good i am a big fan of chocolates like these cant wait to try them out
like the other bars in the range this one comes wrapped in thick textured paper and gold foil when you unwrap it youre immediately hit by a wave of intense chocolatey aromas this is certainly not a subtle bar of chocolate but it is very invitingits not just the chocolate thats intense either theres a generous  if somewhat uneven  sprinkling of salt on the underside which hits you the moment you place a piece on your tonguenothing about this chocolate is understated its incredibly dark and chocolatey but it lacks the refined flavour notes of finer quality cacao theres a slight hint of fruitiness to it but the overwhelming feeling i get when eating it is a memory of when i first tried dark chocolate as a child its robust slightly bitter and very very niceits the kind of chocolate that kicks you in the face but leaves you coming back for more or maybe thats just methis probably isnt the kind of thing that someone who only ever eats milk chocolate would enjoy but i like it a lot and would recommend it to anyone who wants to try something a little differentthanks god i am from poland and hopefully i will visit manufaktura next month i cant see that article or find any other reference to the name but ill take your word for it the bar is imported directly from the manufacturer and isnt old thoughto be candid i like manufaktura czekolady better than chris and toms sure it is hard to pronounce but it is unique while the other is generic to me
although there is no cacao percentage listed i would put the chocolate around the fifties range fortunately the chocolate buttercream doesnt make a mess even when you break off pieces it stays right in its place its mouthfeel is lighter than ganache being not at all stiff despite the fact that it doesnt spill all over the place texture is in fact the main addition it adds to the bar its flavor isnt prevalent over the chocolates together though they taste all of fudge and chocolate cake mix think of a dove bar taken up a stepthis is another item with the vague label product of belgium but i care little where a chocolate is from unless i have specifics or know its from a company that has proved itself to me still the kind of person who would buy a chocolate because it says its belgian is probably going to like this bar it comes under the same scope of similar offerings its the sort of chocolate you do buy as i did while running errands though only stowing in a purse long enough to get to your car home or office by its nature its a chocolate to break up the doings of the day for a few moments that isolation coupled with the fairly flat middle range of the chocolate will be positive for some palettes and forgettable for others i put myself in the latter categorywhats up for all time i used to check website posts here in the early hours in the break of day since i love to gain knowledge of more and more
so what of these nine chocolateswell to start there are in fact only five chocolates as each of the flavours is duplicated with the exception of the cardamom praline which i was a bit disappointed by as i happen to rather like cardamom the cardamom and raspberry pralines were the only milk chocolates in this box so i shall start with themi have made no secret of my liking for cardamom and this example did not disappoint the creamy milk chocolate shell was home to a darker richer praline which balanced very well with the spice it was a similar story with the raspberry heart creamy milk chocolate mingling with raspberry to start then the darker cocoa flavours of the middle coming through the other truffles bore more than a passing resemblance to the archipelago selection once again theres sea buckthorn  blueberry both of which were superior examples the balance of fruit and chocolate was excellent particularly the sea buckthorn the light soft flavours of the fruit complimented the darker richer praline perfectlyits been a while since i tried any chocolate with honey and this one was once again beautifully balanced the honey wasnt overly sweet but it was definitely the first flavour i detected and once the dark chocolate shell  praline filling had melted that soft floral sweetness was never lostcomments are closed
as you can see you get pretty much what you would expect in the box two layers of eight dark chocolate fingers decorated with white chocolate stripes when you open the box youre immediately hit by that after dinner mint aroma mainly mint with a hint of chocolatein this case its a peppermint flavoured truffle which actually looks quite nicethe texture is a little more interesting than the average after dinner mint too as the filling contains tiny pieces of honoeycomb that give it a little bit of a crunch would i buy these well actually i might not to eat myself but to share around with guests theyre fine id probably take them out of the slightly cheap looking box and present them a little more artistically but for  i think theyre pretty good value for what they arematchmakers
the packaging is simple and elegant a plain box tied with a ribbon simply wrapped in brown paper for posting there isnt really any need for anything more as the brownies perfectly fill the box and arent going to get battered around in transit mine arrived in perfect conditionas you can see i have two flavours here a belgian milk chocolate brownie and a dark chocolate one biteme also other flavours including orange and coffee caramel which sound rather good i specifically asked to try unflavoured ones im hoping ill be able to persuade rebecca to send the flavoured ones to try laterthe first thing i noticed was that rather than being thick the brownies are actually quite slim but come in two layers this was actually quite welcome as ive had far too many oversized brownies in the past these ones are just right for enjoying with a cup of tea theyre satisfying but theyre not so big as to make you ill unless youre me and you eat four at oncethat said i do think these could do with just a little more chocolate i particularly liked the dark chocolate version but the milk chocolate one was a little sweet for my tastes  which on past experience usually means that the average chocolate lover will go mad for themyou can buy biteme brownies online link below in a range of different flavours i have my eye on the ninja one myselfcomments are closed
needful to note for such a comparison is that the fourpiece gram godiva box is what five times the price of the world market bar at least the box is pretty the bottom piece is striped in pink and red and a pearly shine sets off the lid whose swirly design is appropriately dessertlike a lavender ribbon completes the frivolous shiny candy shop look im finding it all more interesting than godivas regular plain gold boxes at least when ive finished the truffles i know ill have a box left that looks delightfully like a chocolate syrupcovered scoop of vanilla ice cream in a pink and red dishthe four dessert truffles have a standard godiva look sleek and not rustic or handmade the plastic setting that keeps them in place although not as you can see in upright position doesnt help me feel like im unearthing anything specialas opposed to world markets inclusion of marshmallow bits the element translates here to the truffles white chocolate shell underneath that shell is another one in dark chocolate the world market version tasted more like a standard red velvet cake while the godiva truffles have more richness without a label i doubt i would be thinking red velvet with the label i can taste at least touches of the cake the redness is miniscule but the ganache easily associates with a general moist rich cake the white chocolate is an absolute must for the overall combination to worki can quite happily finish these truffles they reach the indulgent level where sweet and rich collide like in a dessert they just dont put me in awe as godiva never seems to for me these days but i definitely prefer their more flavored pieces like this to the plainer ones not a gift i would mind receivingare you using a serrated knife to cut thoseyes i didi know that isnt the best idea coincidentally though i finally picked up a new knife to use for chocolate dissections that wont leave teeth marksjust curious i probably would have bitten it in half d
so what are stracciatella just like the lindor weve all seen before these are individually wrapped balls but these are white chocolate with what lindt describe as a smooth white praline centre with small pieces of cocoa nibaccording to the box it tastes like cookies and cream it does to a certain extent but it would be more accurate to say tastes like butter and sugar putting a whole stracciatella ball in your mouth is really like sucking on a knob of butter or injecting lard the texture isnt just creamy its ultra smooth and glossy unlike anything else ive tried recentlyafter a moment or two the sweetness kicks in and starts to build as the chocolate melts it just gets creamier and sweeter and glossier and then you encounter the tiny pieces of nib which frankly are a little odd cocoa nibs of course arent sweet at all and can often be quite hard they do give a slightly biscuity flavour to the white chocolate gloop that now covers your entire mouth but they do nothing to cut through the sweetness and barely add any textureyet as sickly sweet as they are lindt stracciatella are utterly utterly addictive its a kind of addictiveness that lies somewhere between a can of pringles and smoking crack when the box is opened its very difficult to stop and then you just feel dirty afterward or maybe thats just mewould i buy these no but only because i would eat them all and feel bad if youre a hardcore white chocolate lover then they may be the best thing youve ever had but opening a box is something best left to those with more self restraint than methey look a bit like hersheys cookies and cream which im slightly ashamed to say i absolutely love might have to give them a trymost disgusting chocolate ever i bought a bag
menakao is a madagascan beantobar chocolate the chocolate is produced on the island rather than the beans being shipped off to a factory somewhere else obviously thats better for the environment and the local economy as more of the profits go back to the people who actually matter but this kind of approach can often result in a better chocolate a little local knowledge is combined with direct contact between the farmer and the chocolate maker its how all chocolate should be madethe packaging is simple if a little rustic which coincidentally is exactly the wording they use on the back of the box to describe the chocolatemy first thoughts on opening were that the flavours are probably going to be a little bit too much madagascan cacao has very vibrant and distinctive flavour notes and the addition of both nibs and salt are only going to intensify that but still i couldnt wait to try itas you can see the chocolate certainly lives up to the rustic monicker im sure there were less loose bits when it left the factory but i have to say i quite like the way it looks it has the appearance of something that has been made by hand rather than an intensely glossy high end chocolatethe nibs are embedded into the underside of the bar and only add to the rustic appeal for methe flavour is wonderful its rich and fruity almost tasting of fresh orange i cant really taste the salt but i can only assume its whats helping lift those fruity notes to a different level it has a little less acidity than most of the intensely citrus madagascan chocolates ive tried and its very easy to eatthe texture and flavour of the nibs gives an added dimension as well theres a delicious crunch to the chocolate and when everything else has melted away youre left with rich intensely chocolately nibs its the perfect counterpoint to the slightly sweet  chocolatei like this bar a lot its certainly more rustic and perhaps not as rounded as other madagascan chocolates but its definitely a bar you should try and at  for g the price is right toocomments are closed
we particularly like the format of the naive bars theyre a fairly standard g but the chocolate is very thin making the bar wider and taller than the average bar theyre simply packaged in foil and matte paper with lots of information and a little story on the front its amazing how simple recyclable packaging can add an air of quality to a bar of chocolatethe chocolate itself is as glossy as the other naive bars save a few marks from the moulding its completely plain apart from the naive logo embossed toward the bottom again its the simplicity that makes this feel like a quality productthere are no chunks on the bar but being so thin its very easy to break off any size piece you like the thinness helps it to melt quickly on the tongue releasing a burst of flavour  this is a delicious bar of chocolate and one thats certainly worth trying but its not quite up there with the best of whats coming out of grenada at the moment and i dont think its the best that naive have to offerme and this article sitting in a tree lgranien
while im not exactly a world traveller i do find myself on occasion having to go to various canadian and american cities as part of my job usually for conferences and when i do i try to find some unfamiliar local chocolate just to liven up my mundane life so when i was recently in ottawa i headed down to the byward market to see what i could dig up it was actually a bit on the disappointing side but that was probably my fault i didnt really do much planning ahead so i was just stumbling around blindly hoping to discover an incredible chocolate cache around the next corner and i didnt but eventually i found a little deli with an overcrowded shelf of familiar bars and hidden amongst them was exactly what i was looking for the chocolate itself is belgian and very rich thanks to a generous amount of cocoa butter it tastes more like a  and doesnt have the depth of flavour in terms of the chocolate that i was hoping for not a big deal  it just impacts speed of consumption and this was one of those bars which was very easy to munch my way through plus i was more interested in that maple sugar which couldnt have competed with anything too robust it added some nice crunch to the bar and inevitable sweetness which plays well with the smooth chocolate and really maple is always a good addition to darker chocolate comments are closed
so for those that dont know itsu is a chain of fast japanese food style restaurants which served the usual assortment of bento boxes sushi and noodle dishes this little box of chocolate coated edamame soy beans to you  me is part of their foray into the snacksweet market the chocolate is  cocoa but also worryingly contains vegetable fats in addition to cocoa butter the packaging is simple enough  a flip top cardboard box and a sellophane bag to keep the beans freshdefinitely recommendedcomments are closed
let me introduce what i call the sodiumdeficiency chocolate range cross paths with it once and you will have enough sodium to last the rest of your lifei paused long over le belges designs the colors fonts and patterns remind me of something a hotel would put out lessening the number of fonts would help the look i also keep comparing the designs to construction paper cutouts but could that just be my disinterest in this artistic stylethe problem is that my perspective on the outside carried on to the inside ironically perhaps my favorites of the five were the  milk chocolate sea salted almond and the  dark sea salt the former is flavorpacked the caramel notes from the chocolate bountiful flakes of sea salt and small almond pieces here and there its impressive that le belge makes such a high amount of salt work here the plain sea salt bar is a basic salt and chocolate pairing since it doesnt have other flavors it is the one where you can taste the chocolate most for  it is fairly sweet but that works to pair with the saltmy least favorite was the tellicherry pepper  sea salt being a  dark it is too sweet a dark chocolate for my tastes it also has a powerful fresh pepper taste too powerful  it overpowers even the salt the semisweet chocolate works better in the himalayan sea salt  strawberry whose strawberry aspect comes from freeze dried strawberries and strawberry flavor the salt thankfully doesnt stand out as much as in some of these the mediterranean sea salt  lemon zest which is another  dark is alright the taste from dried lemon peels and natural lemon citrus flavor is trailed by the salt in an interesting effect strongly disliking one bar not particularly liking two and feeling okay about the other two doesnt justify the price tag for me it is true that the splashes of flavors and semisweet chocolate might work better for other palates than mine but i still feel that there is room for improvement le belge has a basis but i would like to see more sculpting happen on top of thatthe first picture got me drooling instantly i think the wrappers are beautiful
inside is another storythese claim on the pack to have dried cranberries in but they seem to me to be only partly dried the inside is soft a bit squooshy yes that is a word now sweet fruity and kinda yummy the dissectionistas amongst the readers should appreciate that the cut apart ball was done using teeth the chocolate has no stated cocoa percentage but sugar does appear on the label as the first ingredient leading me to think that although dark this is probably about  cocoa the chocolate is fairly sweet rich and complements the cranberries rather well when i let the chocolate melt away it is not at all bitter slightly sweet the word that springs to mind is round odd that this leaves the cranberry inside to slurp and crunch up it is pleasant and fruity but with  no special leapingoutandgrabbingyou flavour these are easyeating little treats not hugely complex clever or sophisticated but nice really nicei made a mistake and left the pack open on the kitchen bench the family vultures have been coming past and grazing judging by how quickly the pack has disappeared the lady of the house as well as the teenage sons seem to think these are pretty good i do tooi still dont know what real cranberries taste like thoughcomments are closed
i found these little g valrhona tanariva bars in my collection so i decided it was time to open them upthe first thing to note is that the format of these smaller bars is very different from the larger andoa bar i reviewed theyre much thinner and thats actually something that can have an impact on flavour as a thinner bar will melt and release its flavour more quicklythe tanariva has  less cocoa solids than the andoa but it isnt noticeably paler in colour in fact if anything its a little darker the chocolates are made with different beans though tanariva uses madagascan cocoa whereas the andoa uses beans from around south america  the caribbeanmadagascan cocoa is known for its fruity citrus notes but in this bar thats almost completely obliterated by the added milk the overwhelming flavour is sweet and creamy with some caramel notes its quite a lot sweeter than the andoa and much less chocolatey i dont think i would recognise this as madagascan if it didnt say so on the labelthis is a chocolate thats ok in small doses but much better suited to those with a very sweet tooth i ate one g bar but didnt feel the need to open the second id recommend skipping this one and going for the andoa insteadcomments are closed
willies notes start with the phrase long forgotten flavours so im guessing this is made from hard to find beans the tasting notes also suggest rich caramel  toffee flavours  with only thee ingredients there was no doubt that i was going to get the full flavour of the beanswhat struck me first about this chocolate was the acidity when you first taste it it comes across as quite bitter with very little cacao flavour coming through as the chocolate begins to soften  melt in the mouth those caramel and toffee flavours start to develop but to be honest i found them more burnt than rich it was almost as if this chocolate had been left on for too long and had acquired a singed flavour this burnt sugar taste tended to persist to the last moments of the chocolate softening out into a long finish which retained a lot of the initial acidity the more subtle flavours of the cacao werent really revealed until the chocolate was more or less gone which i found a little oddin fact odd is about the best description of this chocolate from the tangy aroma to the burnt sugar taste that dominated the whole experience i found myself asking if i would actually buy this to enjoy at home and the answer was almost certainly not ive tasted willies cacao before  have quite enjoyed it but this little oddity is one i wouldnt perk up atcomments are closed
yes we realise this is a little late for the fourth of julyone of my friends told me not to review a fourth of julyindependence day chocolate on a ukbased site but i couldnt resist after all our countries are friends again now arent we plus i was beginning to feel i had to give this tube of sunbursts some attention this was at least the second year i have seen it at world market i ignored it in the past because it didnt seem a very interesting product but approached it this year since there hardly seem to be other fourth of july chocolates springing to my view though i would be delighted if there were tortilla chips and cupcake mixes yes but not chocolatessunbursts are made by the kimmie candy company of reno nevada they are available yearround in different nonredwhiteblue colorings and all the companys products are labelled as gluten free and  made in the usa that last part is fitting the inexpensive tube consists of  grams of candy coated sunflower kernels this is one of the first ingredients lists ive encountered that actually uses the phrase compound chocolate so instead of having quality genes the chocolate is mainly made up of sugar partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil and cocoa powderif i could change one thing naturally it would be to trade out the compound chocolate for something just a step higher these red white and blue kernels may not be the perfect embodiment of patriotic chocoholicness but at least theyre something something i can easily picture a family passing around while camped out at night to watch the fourth of july fireworkscomments are closed
the most immediately impressive thing about choco cocagnes chocolates is how pretty they are ahier has gone with a uniform square shape each decorated with a colourful transfer making them very reminiscent of montreals chocolats genevive grandbois les classiques in both size and shape she also has a wealth of different varieties too  more than twenty are listed on the little leaflet that accompanied the bag of six i tasted they were all dark chocolate  not sure what percentage but im guessing it was around    but the real star of the each and every one was the centres heres a rundown of what i hadso at last i can say that new brunswick has a very talented chocolatier making chocolates which are well worth seeking out im looking forward to working my way through  the others i havent had yet and also picking up some more of those wonderful le feullets comments are closed
the g bar follows the standard format for valrhona consumer chocolate bars eight large chunks with the valrhona logo at the top for a milk chocolate it has a nice clean snap its not overly soft like some milk chocolates can be although theres not much of an aroma to it but it does have a very nice flavour its warm creamy caramelly and very easy to eat theres nothing complicated about it its just a really nice milk chocolatethe texture is smooth without being glossy and the chocolate melts beautifully the best way to eat this chocolate is just to break a small piece off and let it melt on your tongue let the flavours develop and resist the temptation to chewif youre used to the confectionery chocolate that you might find in your local newsagent or supermarket then this is probably going to be a revelation and a great introduction to the world of fine chocolate its sweet enough to keep any milk chocolate lover happy but its never sicklyits currently on sale at  from the chocolate trading company who sent me this sample and at that price id recommend it to any milk chocolate lover looking to try something new its not going to set the world of fine chocolate alight but it is organic fair and a huge step up from the every day milk chocolates you might be used toi am unclear about the valrhona andoa status with the fda  i had thought that they were in dispute with the fda because of the soy lecithan content not being up to organic standards and i was told that they could not market the andoa line as organic until they satisfied the fda  i still see many suppliers still marketing it as organic and fair traded does anyone know the status  i am sure that it is organic and that it is fair traded however i need that fda sealofapproval for my customers  thoughts
there are four different types of truffle in this selection  sea buckthorn blueberry cranberry and crowberry all of which are rich in vitamins amino acids proteins  antioxidants the booklet tells you a little about where the berries can be found and at what time of year and explains which berries have what properties most of us know about blueberry and cranberry  indeed the blueberry was quite recently being touted as another superfood  but the sea buckthorn and crowberry are relatively new to me although i do recall drinking some sort of crowberry alcoholic drink onceaccording to the booklet the sea buckthorn was one of the first plants to establish itself on the archipelago and the berries are used in alternative medicines due to their high antioxidant content and healing oil in combination with the dark chocolate truffle the fruit is subtle yet clearly there with light clean overtones that sit nicely over the deeper chocolate flavours theres a distinct citrus tang to this truffle with the fruitiness persisting to the very last notes of a long clean finishafter the bright light flavours of sea buckthorn the blueberry chocolate is a somewhat more measured affair the fruit blends very well with the chocolate and i found the combination of blueberry  chocolate very enjoyable indeed its not as vibrant as the previous truffle but those fruit flavours still persist to the endof the four i expected the cranberry to be the most tart of the four and its fair to say that it is also the most subtly flavoured of the four theres a cittrus tang there but it sits lower that the previous two allowing more of the chocolate flavour to come through the finish is very much about both flavours with more cacao notes coming through from this onethe crowberry truffle was almost like a brighter version of the blueberry perhaps not as pronounced as the blueberry they do have quite a powerful flavour after all but with more citrussy highs and slightly more acidity but less punch than the blueberry or sea buckthorn it was quite a subtle mixture of flavours with the real fruit flavour coming through really well as the chocolate faded away at the finishcomments are closed
what is clear is that its a  cocoa solids milk chocolate with coriander and caramelised pecan which sounds rather niceand rather surprisingly it actually is the milk chocolate is sweet and creamy but the overwhelming flavour is the coriander its warm and spicy and really rather nice but as far as im concerned the best part of this bar is the small pieces of caramelised pecan theyre sweet and crunchy and really quite moreish its actually a bit of a shame that you dont seem to be able to buy this any more it may well be available somewhere in the world but ive not managed to find it let us know if you find it anywhereim not sure about coriander in chocolate the pecans sound okay if i was reviewing this product i would have ascertained with the manufacturers marketing dept how the public could obtain this it sounds delicious but after taking the trouble to read the review  it is frustrating to discover that its not for sale
having control over the entire chocolate making process makes a huge difference to a flavoured chocolate as well as being able to match cacao origin to the flavour youre creating the chocolate making process can be precisely controlled to enhance the natural flavours in the chocolate as you can see my bar is a little battered but thats probably down to my own mistreatment it certainly didnt effect the flavour the chocolate has a nice clean snap although the texture on the tongue is a little soft and its not as smooth or glossy as a lot of the bars ive had lately but the upshot of that is that it melts quite quickly and releases loads of flavour the moment it hits your tongueand that brings me to the biggest down side of this bar you just get a single g square per pack and if youre anything like me g wont last very longthe up side is that its great value at just  youre unlikely to find a beantobar chocolate at a better price so you can always buy two or try some of the other flavours theres also a fantastic white chocolate that im hoping to review very sooni saw this in waitrose today will have to try it when i go next  i sadly am one of those who loves terrys co or anything choc and orangey
the design on this millcreek bar shows restraint which i mean in a good way it doesnt overdo colors or patterns and doesnt flashily overpromise anything that said i think that if the designers felt inspired in the future to tweak the look that would be nice but im content for now sliding off the cover reveals a special touch the millcreek story is printed on an elegant pearlyshining square of paper instead of on the back of the box the  gram bar is also impressive it wears a glowing skin with enough smooth space to let its beauty show and a large version of the millcreek logo that gives the appearance of a medallion the small air bubbles just communicate the handmade touch the chocolates aroma is nuanced a good signmy booklet tells me that the ecuadorian arriba nacional chocolate is fruity and nutty the warm undertones lure you into a luxuriously smooth rich finish for me the key point in there is warm which i might also describe as spicythough of course not chili pepper spicy i think many palates would pass it off as bitter but what i want to emphasize is its depth it has the layering of flavors that makes a chocolate high end the warm notes are there from start to finish but as the chocolate melts touches of sweetness swirl into your mouth keeping bitterness from being an issue for friends of the dark side completely smooth it melts consistently and fluidly all of these characteristics are good since the bar comes in at  the upper end of chocolate prices i only wonder since this is on the darker side yet is also the base for millcreeks flavored bars if it works as well in those contexts but that isnt completely relevant for this review ill just say that for future additions to the line a milder bar would widen the appeal not that the deeper side of this chocolate wasnt refreshing or that a company need necessarily appeal to nondark side membersi had the marks and spencer  ecuadorian  bar fairtrade certified and co neutral and loved it so this bar sounds quite amazing  pity they dont get em where im from
every once in a while i like to review something a little different from the fine dark chocolate we normally write about something sweet sickly or just plain weird if only to remind myself just how much the chocolate i eat now is compared to what i used to eatcybercandy specialise in hard to find imported confectionery they dont sell fine chocolate but i was still quite excited when they got in touch and asked if wed like some review samplessmall problem i looked through their website and the majority of chocolate products they had are things weve already reviewed at some point over the years so i ended up with just a couple of bars that i hadnt seen before including this thingthe first thing i noticed was that the chocolate was a little bloomed but that could be partly down to how i stored themthe goo inside is described as rum cream and caramel but really its just a rumflavour gloop as soon as i cut into it it started to flow out and make a mess everywhere the taste is like a cheap rum  raisin flavour chocolate bar only sweeter the chocolate is a very basic  cocoa solids dark chocolate and although its quite nondescript its not offensive either but you dont really buy this for the chocolate you buy it for the sugar hit it certainly does its job on that front although its by no means the sweetest bar ive ever tried the rumflavour caramel is kind of unusual but if im buying weird foreign confectionery im generally looking for something a bit more unusual than thiscomments are closed
haighs stores are special everything looks fantastic the presentation is precise clear and clean i suspect i could eat my dinner off the counter and probably the floor  the staff wear white coats and even more amazing they want to help and something you never see anywhere else  when handling the chocolate the staff put on a pair of white gloves now thats how these things are supposed to be donei could have chosen from a huge range of boxed gift chocolates or freshly made chocolates from the glass counter available individually instead i opted for a big mansize block which will be the subject of a later review but the reason for this rambling writeup is the impulse buy on the counter were small plastic packs of product of the month  choc berries so i had to have a pack of those as welland thus it happened that watching television a day or so later yes they did last that long i was overcome by an attack of the chocolate munchies and decided to break into the pack i even shared them with the lady of the housethe pack contains two types  a milk chocolate with strawberry and a dark chocolate with raspberry both are best enjoyed by letting the chocolate melt slowly in your mouthdark raspberrythis begins with a very rich fairly sweet dark chocolate which is both earthy and very fruity at the same time although called dark this is not a bitter chocolate at all it just melts away to leave a sweet fruit centre this centre is not a dried berry as is sometimes found instead its some kind of fruity confection soft sweet and intensely flavoured on trying this my immediate reaction was oh my goodness you have to try one of thesemilk strawberrythe milk chocolate reminds me a lot of the milk chocolates we dont seem to find a lot of in australia the aroma seems to resemble that of some european brands while i found it difficult to identify the dominant aroma it reminds me a little of condensed milk the flavour though is subtle rich quite sweet and not as fruity as the dark chocolate milk chocolate lovers will go into raptures over it in a similar manner the inside is fruit confection which delivers a burst of flavour at the endboth of these little balls of joy are simply outstanding although a small pack is not cheap if you are near haighs  pop in and pick some up you dont be disappointedhaighs are an australian institution  melbourne and adelaide especially  and they have a factory tour too much classier than you might expect for australians
this is one of those chocolate bars where i have so much to say its difficult to know where to startgot one good lets beginbut this isnt just any chocolate bar im sure youre already aware that the grenada chocolate company is just about the most the most ethical and sustainable chocolate making cooperative on the planet but this bar takes those ideals to extremes its not just about ethics though owners mott green and chantal coady have gone to equally extreme lengths to get the best possible flavour out of each and every bean that has gone into this chocolatei want to share a few facts about gru grococo to illustrate just how much effort went into producing itat  this may be the most expensive chocolate bar you ever buy but it may also be the best years of reviewing chocolate has taught me that its a very subjective thing and what some people love others may hate but i really think you can feel and taste the quality and attention to detail that has gone into producing this barrococos chantal coady told me that we should all be paying more for a chocolate the price that most people expect to pay for a bar of chocolate does not reflect the work that goes into producing it as a result cocoa farmers struggle to make a living and as consumers weve become used to very poor quality chocolatepaying a few pounds extra for a bar of chocolate like this is like paying a little extra for a quality wine its not something you need to do every day but when you do the difference is obviousand that difference really is obvious in this chocolate of course its beautifully moulded using the same moulds the grenada chocolate company use for all their bars its a glossy deep redishbrown colour and in itself its a work of art its almost a shame to break into it but wonderful aroma means you wont be able to resist for long of course it breaks with a beautiful clean snap and looks just as good on the inside as it does on the outside and it tastes wonderful its not just the chocolate making process and pricing thats comparable to wine its the flavour too and this chocolate has a wonderfully fruity flavour very much like the madagascan chocolate i love so much but a little less jarring and intense than madagascan beans can be after the fruity hit the flavour develops into something more rounded sweet and chocolateyyumi wish i could get my hands on that chocolate i would pay the steep price alasin canada and too far north to pop over to london great reviewi do not indulge in chocolate very often but i do love them i am also willing to splurge a tad if its going to be as delicious as gru grococo the picture alone is very tempting its making my gob waterliving in grenada and being lucky enough to actually live near the grenadian chocolate factory and even luckier to know well the founder and hombre extrodinaire mott we really benefit from his exquisite product and use it every day in our hotel giving so much pleasure and interest to all our guests i support and love this exceptional chocolate the best in the world  keep calm and carry on producing and sharingi love rococo chocolate now i must get my hands on some of that grococo bar it sounds absolutely divine as i like you love chocolate from madagascar and if you say this is even better  well ill have to see for myself hope i can get some on this side of the pond  thanks for the headsupi was just munching on that lovely chocolate bar as i savour it slowly this evening and it has made me think of my trip there in  on those places and people who are working for us to enjoy this fruity little tangy taste and it has that eathines and sustainabiliy coming through just like he whole grenada chocolate company ethics mott has left a big mark on me even though i met him one no ego or pretendence he was all about making this work with the people that is something to think when eating chocolate thinking of people
the upshot is that nothing i was shown is likely to be available for a while and by the time september comes around i will have completely forgotten about it and this jar of pietra chocolate and caramelised hazelnut spread will be long gonethere were two main themes to the products i was shown lemon and breakfast i tried a rather nice lemon macaron that contained absolutely no chocolate so i probably shouldnt even mention that here pierre is also launching a granola which seems a bit of a strange thing for a patissiere to do if you ask me it was nice enough but not something i would buy myself i did try a few chocolates  most of which werent part of this launch   but this jar of spread was was the only thing i really wanted to take home lucky for me we were given a jar in the goody bag we receivedthe thing that makes this a little different from post chocolate spreads is the hazelnuts not little pieces of chopped hazelnuts but whole nuts and plenty of themthe problem with most chocolate  hazelnut spreads is that the main ingredient is very often vegetable oil by contrast the ingredients listed on this jar are hazelnuts  sugar cocoa beans hazelnut paste grape seed oil hazelnut oil cocoa butter natural vanilla emulsifierthe spread will be available from pierre herms shops and online from th september which is unfortunate as im going to need another jar a lot sooner than thatcomments are closed
you know what the medals and award markers that have been appearing on chocolate packaging remind me of the same medals printed on book covers while i have read plenty of books with such awards i have never read a book because it had one its just something ill notice afterward agreeing that the book had been worthy enough for such acknowledgementafter the designs on those the plainer eco look of the new set agave caramels amella sent me this time was a tad disappointing this look just doesnt hold my attention in the same way though it will certainly attract the consumers seeking chocolatedipped caramels that are free of gluten and corn syrup all natural and made with pure cocoa butter and raw blue agave nectar the latter item is what replaces the corn syrupthe first thing to come to mind on tasting was the flavor of a riesen and i think that was before i had even registered the caramel beneath the layer of dark chocolate yet i would say that the chocolate here funnily enough isnt as dark of flavor i does though melt just like the feeling of silk slipping across your fingertips somewhere in the midst of this whole concoction is what i want to call a bitter taste although that is hardly the right adjective since it also seems connected to the sweetness i want to say its the agave nectar and since there are both agave nectar and sugar in here the caramels are sweeter than i expected you could i suppose call it a more grownup sweetness since its basis isnt of the confectionary sort concerning the caramel itself it is neither stiff nor liquid its chewiness is slight and it has a mild graininessoverall it has a natural handmade feel so though i probably got less excited over these caramels than the colorful ones last time theyre still quality they did earn that little medal picture i wouldnt quite call them trufflelike as their description on the box indicates the experience is still of a caramel but in perfect cohesion with alluring chocolate to allow you to melt away for a few momentscomments are closed
brick house is a bakery in east dulwich that specialises in sourdough bread apparently the bread is slow roasted to intensify the flavour and give it a nice crunch before being mixed with chocolate and moulded into bars the bar is standard format for paul a young its g and costs about  it was marked at  but i was charged  in pauls soho shopbut the real highlight of this bar is the texture the bread feels like tiny biscuit pieces and make this just about the crunchiest bar of chocolate youre ever likely to experience somehow the crunch itself seems to intensify the chocolate flavour making this a bar thats very difficult to put downbut as delicious as this bar is im still not completely convinced that i want to have to crunch munch and chew a bar of fine chocolate id much rather let it melt slowly but if you do that you do end up with a mouthful of toast when the chocolate has melted comments are closed
from what i can gather eat  joy is a farmersartisan food producer market specialising in finnish produce ranging from fruits to fish to exotic meats bear sausages anyone and of course chocolate i had a quick chat with aki arjola who was manning the shop that day and his enthusiasm and love for finnish produce was evident from the off i wish id had more time to chat and make notes but it was all i could manage to pick out a few items to stuff into my already bulging hand luggage before running to my flightthis g slab of dark chocolate is my first foray into fine finnish chocolate and i was a little disappointed to discover that dark means  cocoa  the european bittersweet percentage and that unfortunately eat  joy have neglected to inform us of the origins of their chocolateits a chunky slab of dark glossy chocolate which has quite a dark aroma with subtle leathery high notes in the mouth it melts quickly and then the salt comes out to play when they sprinkled the salt on this bar they werent scrimping and thats definitely a very good thing because otherwise this chocolate might be nothing more than another reasonable middle of the road sortofsweet darkish chocolate barinstead the simple addition of salt creates little bursts of contradictory flavours which in themselves serve to lift the overall taste of this bar from alright i suppose to really rather nice could i have another piece the finish of this finnish chocolate sorry i had to is light clean and long and there are usually little salty fireworks lurking to the end as wellim not sure id call this great chocolate but i can call it moreish comments are closed
but the first thing i noticed was just how beautiful the bar is simply wrapped in foil and paper and beautifully moulded it looks and feels like a quality productof course what differentiates this bar is the addition of himalayan salt sprinkled over the back of the bar theres not as much of it and its finer grained salt than i was expecting but even this small amount really does help lift the flavour of the chocolatethe result is a truly delicious chocolate the naturally sweet and slightly fruity notes of the grenada chocolate work perfectly with the hint of salt i do think it may have benefited from a little more coarser grained salt as that would have added an additional texture element but thats a minor point this is a chocolate i could eat all dayif youve not tried any grenada chocolate yet this is the bar id recommend starting your journey withi was sent these group of pictures right aunord my fathers birthday may  and as he had passed in  seeing them for the first time ever in  of him as a young vibrant vital handsome devil in  was like a call from heaven amazing pictures are worth a thousand thousand words god bless men like bill cameron i grew up hearing his name once in a while when we perused the old albums and even toyed with naming a son cameron got  girls though but that makes a nice girl name too so it is like a reward from heaven like a  well done my son  from god to see these pictures of me and my mother louise and father bill from  years ago god bless you bill more
anyway this time around it is a rather pretty bar of milk chocolate with caramelized almonds and dried cherries the look of the bar right down to the packaging is very reminiscent of the newer lindt passion bars with the peephole box that shows off the encrusted surface and as the photos show theres a lot of stuff on there so much that theres an assumption that this is a bar which will positively explode with flavour but as heidi demonstrated to me in the past it isnt quite that simplethe chocolate is relatively sweet anyway  only  which is perfectly acceptable for milk chocolate  but the caramelized almonds adds to that quite significantly and the cherries dont actually get much of a look in apart from a periodic fruity burst that could easily be some other kind of berry instead i really was expecting to be slapped across the face by the cherries and all i got was a polite tap on the shoulder the sweet crunchy almond pieces were rather nice though and they were what kept me coming back despite the added sugar so this was a slightly above average bar of chocolate which is definitely one to eat rather than to savour the level of sweetness was just too high for me and i couldnt get through more than a couple of squares at a time with persistence i did eat the whole thing but i dont think id pick it up again those with a very sweet tooth might enjoy it though i on the other hand am waiting to see what else romania as waiting in the wings
red berry pralinethis may win a prize for the cutest looking chocolate ever designed to look like a little ladybird complete with chocolatebuttonface its almost a shame to eat it its an unusual chocolate in that the base is dark chocolate while the top part of the shell is coloured white chocolate i assume this is to give some rich cocoa notes to what would otherwise be a purely white chocolate inside theres a layer of praline and another of red fruit jelly it tastes really good  like posh peanut butter and jam i could happily eat a box of thesepinot noir  cherrythe moment i cut into this milk chocolate ball the filling started to pour out it has a similar consistency to caramel but has a sweet cherry flavour with just a hint of wine its fruity tangy and delicious like a grownup version of the  cherry flavour sweets i used to eat as a child i want more of these too please svenriesling  passion fruitthe second domeshaped chocolate which again features a white chocolate shell and a dark chocolate base inside a layer of ganache and a passion fruit jelly i think this one is more of an acquired taste and i found the combination of flavours didnt work quite as well as the other chocolates but i still want moreraspberry  rhubarba dark chocolate ball coated in white chocolate and decorated with a tangy fruit powder inside is a pale rhubarb and raspberry ganache that has the same thin texture as the pinot noir  cherry and a flavour with a deliciously fruity kick yeah id like some more of these ones tooi think this selection particularly appeals to my love of fruity flavours so if thats not your thing you might not get as much out of them as i did herzog does a complete range of other beautiful looking chocolates so i think theres probably something for everyone i cant wait to try moreyou are correct those chocolates are very pretty   not sure about the fruit part though but that is just my personal preference i have not tasted them yet do you pick up the majority of these chocolates out of pocket or do the companies provide themits a mixture personally i get sent more review samples than i buy myself these were review samplesi assumed that was the case but im always curious to know do you think you could make note of it in future reviews
overall im quite pleased truffle boxes of this size sell for  from ceros which is most reasonable this company seems to know what its doing these arent the same washedout chocolates you can get anywhere theyre more innovative while still in the realm of casual this is what im happy to discover from what i called another little candy companyomg ive had the persion the saigon and the lavender truly amazing lovely flavors from start to finishlovely flavors from start to finish
if you dont know franois pralus hes a french beantobar chocolate maker pralus have their own plantation in madagascar although the packaging doesnt actually say if the the beans in this bar come from there or elsewhere im sure some knowledgable chocablog reader will be able to tell us but very often the answers to these questions arent simpleinside the simple paper and foil wrapper the actual chocolate looks a little rough and ready theres a wonderful gloss to it but it does look a bit scuffed and battered personally i like the way it looks but this bar is more about flavour and texture than appearancei adore the flavour of the pralus  bar it has a touch of natural sweetness but it has a very distintive flavour that for some reason reminds me of marmite but in a good way the smooth glossy texture  thanks to a high cocoa butter content  makes it incredibly easy to eat and that was something i was hoping for in this bari wasnt disappointed all the distinctive madagascan flavour notes are there but the addition of sugar seems to enhance the deep red fruit notes naturally present in the chocolate i could nibble at the  bar all day  this bar would be lucky if it lasted half a day it has an ultrasmooth buttery texture that i personally love because its so different from most other high cocoa chocolates although it might be a touch too buttery for somethe flavour is what i really love though its a mixture of full on deep roasted cocoa beans and light sweet raspberries theres a little acidity to it but the fruity notes are what really come through and stay with you long after the chocolate has gone now i just need someone to take it away from me or i may just eat the rest of the bar in one sittinghighly recommended  but id also recommend you try the  bar for comparisonps have a nice day in the sun if you get out first bit of sun ive seen in days the order website statesthis single origin chocolate bar uses only fine flavour criollo cocoa organic from madagascarand it looks good  i think i may have to give both these bars a try d  thanks for the reviewyoure right  im just wondering if the beans come from praluss own estate or other estates on the island i suspect the latter  not that its a problem im just curious where my chocolate comes frompralus started harvesting from his own estate on nosy b last year but didnt have enough beans from there for an entire production run so the  vintage is from sambirano valley going forward for later in  hell probably have a blend of nosy b and sambirano until yields at nosy b are sufficientalso the criollo is an admixture that in all likelihood includes other varieties
heres a nifty way of carrying around a quick chocolate fix this little tin contains oz g for metric readers of dark chocolate balls  perfect for a pocketbaghandbag one notable thing about this product is the lack of any sort of information regarding cocoa content or ingredients i therefore have to conclude that these are made from godivas house dark chocolate my attempts to garner further information via the web were pretty fruitless although i did discover that they contain soy and may contain nuts not much help there theni cant help feeling that this is another example of a big name manufacturer coasting along trading on their reputation totally oblivious to some of the magical things that are being produced by people with a passion for chocolate break down the price and youre looking at p per gram of anonymous factory produced chocolate throw a few more pennies in and you could be enjoying something from a company with a reputation for passion creativity and above all great tasting ingredients its a nobrainer avoid im sure that you are absolutely right in every specific about this candy but you seem to be discounting the magic of just about anything packaged in a tin the cute retro atomic age style graphic even makes me want to buy it and i know betterwell yes of course i kept the tin
the even sweeter than the chocolate creamy filling is home to tiny pieces of biscuit and blueberry which deliver a nearperfect reproduction of blueberry pie its uncanny its a very well balanced set of flavours it is also incredibly sweet  so much so that more than i could just finish a second piece in the hands and mouth of a younger chocolate muncher it was a very different story favourite new chocolate by a mile and i am now under oath to bring back loads of it should i ever return to finlandits a bit of a tributecover version of the petits desserts range right down to the way it looks but it goes in a slightly different fruitier direction and pulls it off admirably the chocolate is fairly average but the overall combination works very well  just dont go there if you dont have a sweet toothi loved this one its a tad too sweet as mentioned in the post but texture is beautiful and melts even before you realize it
like all their other bars this one has been given a cute little name that attempts to capture both its spirit and the purpose that the company has in mind for it its called lunatic and has the ability to in their words cool the monthly madness now i cant even begin to determine if it can do that so it is probably best i just focus on the taste of the chocolate instead i should note that it is infused with maca just like the banana bar and that i do like their quirky packagingthe generous helping of nibs throughout serve a couple of functions  they add the obvious texture to the bar but more importantly they give some intense bursts of bitterness that punctuate the mint it has depth and it has dimensions and is one of the better new bars ive tried in quite a while i like this one a lot so i can happily recommend zazubean mint  cocoa nibs but only if you are already partial to mint chocolate you can let me know if it stops you howling at the moon also wanted to drop you a line to tell you thank you for your lovely reviews i absolutely love reading them and gazing at the porn  erm pictures of chocolate your honesty is refreshing 
ive had this bar for a little while now and every time i sat down and thought to myself ill review this now i just ended up having a couple of squares and losing myself in a chocolatey moment which is in many ways testament to just how well duffy makes chocolate to date i cannot recall being anything other than surprised and delighted at the complexity and depth of duffys efforts and this bar is no exceptionthe tasting notes on the back of the package promise a complex mix of fresh hay mellow red fruits and a roast chestnut aftertaste and thats pretty much what youre going to get with a total of four ingredients one of which is soy lecithin and therefore doesnt really enter into the flavour equation this chocolate begins with a soft slightly acidic greeny note which then increases in depth as the richness of the cacao starts to come through those red berry notes are evident throughout peaking before the chocolate is all melted and filling the mouth with luscious rich fruity cacao which does indeed finish with a chestnut sweetnessi had this bar on the go while i was reviewing other bars notably a recent lindt creation and to even begin to compare this bar to anything made on an industrial scale would be almost impossible  as was returning to other chocolate after a taste of this regular readers will by now be quite accustomed to the phrase too sweet in many reviews well the good news is that this is another duffy delight  perfectly balanced cacao flavours great depth beautiful long finish and just a hint of cane sugar sweetness to set things off and like every one of his bars reviewed by us it comes highly recommendedthe other chocolate review sites mention a deep molasses character to duffys chuno did you notice any of that in your bar simonnot as much as i have with other bars the cane sugar lends it a darker more earthy sweetness but its not what i would call molasses
the front of the bar follows the standard askinosie format with the name of the company spelled out on each large chunk of chocolate but the back of this bar is a little differentas you can see its littered with pieces of organic glutenfree salted black liquorice and anise seed theres also fleur de sel and goats milk in the chocolate so as you might expect its not subtleeven if you try to get a sense of the chocolate by placing a piece liquoricesideup on your tongue your mouth is still immediately filled by that intense flavour and aroma this may be a hefty  milk chocolate but it still quickly fades into the backgroundi do think its a good choice of chocolate for this bar though as it does have a certain creaminess that goes well with the liquorice and its neither too sweet nor too bitterin the end how much you like this bar comes down to whether or not you like liquorice as thats the predominant flavour by farwhat i love about it is that its just so different from other chocolate ive had recently askinosie are of course a top beantobar chocolate maker and it always makes me happy when real artisans make fun nontraditional flavours like this it may be more highend confectionery than than it is fine chocolate but i still like itoh my goodness this one made my mouth water a little
after all this waffle the inevitable question must be asked whats the chocolate likeand the chocolate is actually pretty good it has a pleasant richness in both taste and aroma there is no goo  the mint is just part of the chocolate it is quite pleasant and certainly not overpoweringthe collective criticisms of the tasting panel were that the chocolate has a gritty appearance and the mint leaves a slightly harsh aftertaste neither of these are offensive the gritty look is only in appearance it has no effect on taste or texture  the mint aftertaste is more of a concern however you do need to be fairly fussy to detect it even the darkchocolatehater thought this was ok her normal reaction to anything darkish is that it is too bitter this time however even she could go back for morethe general view was that this is the best of the mikado range we tried if mint chocolate is your thing see if you can find one of thesecomments are closed
excuse my conversing with inanimate objectsthe pieces of toffee which are handmade in small batches inside copper kettles come in varying sizes the smaller pieces have the most to fear from me since they are easier to snatch up and munch away on it turns out that the larger pieces are more deadly to me breaking them up might knock off some of the toppings so i just bite in and once ive started on a piece how can i stop i dont understand why toffee should be one of my weaknesses thats just the way the world worksas you can see this toffee is fairly thick and generously coated its difficult to get a grasp on victim as milk chocolate other than to say that it adds a creamy flavor to the mix the toffee is of a slightly harder more orange variety than some in honesty i think i prefer the toffees that border closer to delicate however this style is fitting for the pioneer theme because of the toffees thickness and the amount of almonds there is as much crunchy texture as you could wish for and enough sweetness that you do need all those almonds for balancevictim b doesnt have any chocolate the white chocolate is more like a sweet cream keeping the macadamia nuts in place the large triangular shape of the pieces and the white and yellow colors makes them look like peanut butter and honey sandwiches i suppose you could say they taste like that too i think its fair at least to say that this bunch is sweeter and less salty than the first but that might just make it easier to absentmindedly nibble i must point out though that the toffee in this box did feel too thick a tad thinner would be betterin case you prefer drawing out your toffeetorturing you can store it for three weeks in the refrigerator or six months in the freezer its pleasant toffee if you find yourself in colorado with a confection craving of if you find yourself at home with two boxes of it that somehow never make it to the safety of the refrigerator because youre too busy snacking on itcomments are closed
lallapolosa make an extensive range of brownies cakes cookies  confections but if i had to pick any one item this would probably be it for one thing they come in huge boxes of  kg or  kg that look beautiful tied with a ribbon and wrapped in tissue paper they just feel like a quality handmade giftbut the wow factor doesnt really hit you until you lift the lid and peel back the paper inside rather than individually packaged brownies youre presented with a large slab of brownie which has been cut into slices before being shoehorned into the box its quite an impressive sightthe surface of the brownie is loaded with pecans and smothered in caramel its crunchy and gooey and delightfully difficult to pick up a single slice without making a complete messafter id finally managed to free a single slice i managed to get some onto a plate for closer examination the bulk of the top layer is made up of nuts chocolate and caramel with more of the actual brownie towards the bottomwhen i bit into it one word came to mind snickersit has that same nutty caramel flavour and chewy texture but of course is much richer fresher and tastier to be honest the actual brownie is really just a carrying mechanism for all these other delicious ingredients its there but its not the star of the showi love the fact that theyre so beautifully presented and come in a box so big that you just have to share it theyre a bit different from other brownies ive tried lately and while they might appeal less to brownie purists if there is such a thing theyre a delicious and indulgent snack and now i just have the other  slices to get throughshare it like um with me happy to but i dont think im going to see you before next weekthis site is dangerous to my healthi need chocolate what a lovely site and different chocolates
the club offers  month  month and annual subscriptions at  per month at least i assume thats the per month price as the website lists all subscription options for the same price rather than giving the total cost of the subscription for your money you get a g box of assorted chocolates delivered every monththe first thing i noticed about my box was that it didnt look very french i usually associate french chocolates with style and sophistication but these are presented in a very ordinary looking purple and blue box inside the purple plastic insert that holds the chocolates is made from a very cheap thin plasticof course packaging isnt everything but first impressions do count and frankly these look cheap theres also some scuffing and a hint of blooming on some of the chocolates which doesnt help with the appearancethe label on the bottom of the box tells me that the dark chocolates are  cocoa solids and the milk chocolates are  which is pretty good theres a few solid chocolate pieces to try so i started off trying to get a feel for the chocolate the milk chocolate is passable but the  dark has no real flavour at all its bitter and dry and has very little going for itmany of the chocolates have praline fillings which do at least add some texture and flavour to the chocolate but theyre not really my thingi picked up a white chocolate heart and noticed it had leaked red goo into the plastic tray below but i took a bite anyway inside the thin white chocolate shell was a rather cheap strawberry that immediately flowed out i dont think ive ever seen a chocolate simply filled with jam before and now i know whyi had higher hopes for the dark chocolate framboise but again this turned out simply to be filled with jam it was a little better though not being quite as sweet and working better with the dark chocolatethe square chocolate pralines decorated with sugar coated candies in the centre of the box did turn out to be quite pleasant but they were the highlight of a selection that is at best uninterestingunfortunately then i cant recommend these if you have  a month to spend on chocolates there are much much better options available and unless club chocolat franais seriously up their game i cant see it catching on over herecomments are closed
as you can see the format of the bar is exactly the same as the rest of the excellence range its a simple thin g bar divided into ten squaresa quick glance at the back reveals that this bar uses the same rather disappointing  cocoa solids chocolate as the wasabi bar so i was expecting it to be sweet  especially when combined with caramelthe caramel comes in the form of hard crunchy pieces scattered throughout the chocolate also scattered through the bar is a small amount of sea salt but for me its not really enough to lift the flavouras youd expect the chocolate is very sweet but the surprise is the caramel which has a very burnt flavour reminiscent of a crme brle its a very distinctive flavour and probably wont be to everyones taste but for this particular bar i think its a fairly good counterpart to the sweetness of the chocolatei wasnt entirely sure the sea salt added much to the flavour a small piece often contains no salt at all but a second piece might contain a couple of large crystals of salt i would rather have had smaller more regular crystals as i think they would have had a bigger impact on the overall flavour without the slightly strange sensation of going from very sweet to very saltythis is clearly confectionery rather than fine chocolate and thats something thats reflected in the very reasonable  price tag i managed to make my way through the bar something i can rarely do with sweet confectionery chocolate these days but i would still rather see the cocoa content bumped up to at least  as it is its too sweet for my tastes but its an interesting take on the caramel  chocolate combination thats worth trying if you have a sweeter toothit took me a while to realize that its really a new bar i looks like the combination of their caramel dark  a touch of sea salt bars that sounds good to me dmy first bite had a very strong taste of coconut but no coconutcoconut oil in the ingredients  anyone else have the same experience
kopali organics fits well in stores like whole foods based on all the ecoempowerment type phrases on the package they have both fair trade and usda organic certification and heavily emphasize working with farmers and the environment ultimately to produce a nutritious and conscious produce the name kopali comes from the nahuatl word for incense usually associated specifically with tree resins the tree of course takes on all of its symbolic meaning all good and admirable so faryoull notice that these individual pieces dont have a shiny finish for the banana element both dried banana and rice flour are added in so a medium thickness of chocolate surrounds small pieces of chewy banana no crunch but it isnt gummy either as far as the chocolate i praised its sweetener is evaporated cane juice and its flavor earthy it isnt too dark does have a light sweet effect and has enough flavor complexity to keep me interested of course the banana infuses itself into even the solid chocolate causing part of that complexitykopali organics has scored on many important levels with this product they have given me the elusive banana pairing in a way that is neither false nor stickysweet nor overly pretentious its a product that tastes good apart from its healthy ecofriendly tenets and i think the world is growing more and more appreciative of such tenets kopali also makes chocolate covered espresso beans goji berries mulberries and cacao nibs if you need more variety the bananas worthiness at least as a chocolate snack i can vouch fori agree with you on a dislike for the quality of chocolate covered items many i find are chocolate flavoured coatedhmmm these do look good however
one thing that has often been said about lindt is that you do get whats written on the package their bars may not be highend artisan made or exclusive but they are a cut above your average high streetsupermarket fodder and we feel that they do offer the slightly more adventurous consumer an opportunity to dip a toe into slightly more upmarket and occasionally more unusual chocolatethat said i dont think any of us here would agree that  cacao content is dark chocolate but thats the percentage that lindts dark bars have as is often the case a good deal of the other  of this bar is sugar  almost half in fact  and this is readily apparent when you waft a piece of the bar under your nose its a familiar smell to me  light cacao notes and a lot of sweetnesswhen you pop a piece of the bar into your mouth the wasabi is apparent from the off the chocolate begins to melt and that slightly earthy mustardy flavour creeps in to mingle with the dark cacao notes i found that the sweetness of this bar tended to detract from the wasabi somewhat  it never really gets to shine and perhaps some of this has to do with the fact that wasabi flavouring was usedmy previous wasabichocolate experiences were somewhat spicier and darker than this bar and much more to my own personal preferences ie much more cacao much less sugar and real wasabi but saying that i appreciate that lindts bars are not aimed at the connoisseur these are the bars that the uk supermarkets top end best of and finest ranges seek to emulate and occasionally surpass in terms of content and as such i can see this being something regular lindt lovers would have a go at  probably for the novelty value at first but perhaps as a regular treat once triedspeaking from my own personal experience i prefer more cacao much less sugar and a little more wasabi but thats just me if you fancy something a bit out the ordinary  dont happen to live near a chocolatier then this might just tick that box for youi completely agree i quite enjoyed it and im very happy that lindt are experimenting with unusual flavours but it needs more heat and less sugarthis flavour of chocolate is without doubt the most disgusting i have ever had and whats worse is it cost me  on offer from tesco when i should have been paid to try this vile chocolateneedless to say the next time i buy chocolate i will stick with divine or greenblacksi have to agree with karl wasabi and chocolate is just wrong i tried it for the first time this week and i think i may have to throw the rest of the bar in the bin its just horrible ill stick to lindt sea salt and lindt chilli flavours ohh and wasabi with sushi onlythis is an amazing chocolate  i have not tried any other make of wasabi dark chocolate but we dont get that much choice here in the outer hebrides  what made this for me was a combination of this chocolate and bunabhian malt whisky  i know i know it sound really weird but this malt is salty and that flavour combination and the effect of the whicky breaking into the chocolate is just stunning  dont knock it until you try iti have tried it and found it utterly disgusting and so did all of my friends who had a piecebut someone has to like it and you are the first i have heard of so fari just tried this and i can honestly say that it is absolutely vile truly one of the most disgusting things i have ever eaten i enjoy wasabi and i enjoy chocolate but the combination of the two here is indescribably horrible it isnt even the sweetness of the chocolate that is the problem although it might not help  rather the concept is just plainly direi agree  i love them both but this particular combo just doesnt work i think that the sweetness and low cocoa content is the issue howeveri just saw this for the first time in bc canada and just had to buy it i think i may be the odd one out because i loved it although youre correct on too much sugar tone that down with a slightly bigger hit of wasabii also live in bc and just picked this up over the weekend  it was exactly what i expected chocolate and wasabi  and i liked it  i bought it primarily for my teenaged son and he loved itcouldnt make out what the flavour reminded me of at first but then my wife suggested horseradish silly me  should have googled wasabe first and should have suspected that it was not the real mccoy when i bought it from tesco for less than  its going straight in the bin  quite the worse type of chocolate ive tastedi am a little bit wiser  for having purchased this wasabi chocolate bar i now know that i will never buy it again and almost thought about giving up chocolate altogether it was that bad wasabi in sushi may be a different thing but keep it out of chocolate for me i also tossed mine in the bin as i couldnt bear to expose anyone else to the experience i hadjeeza lot of hate for this bar i found that i really enjoyed the combination of the chocolate and wasabi i like the sweetness of the bar that gives way to the lingering aftertaste and sinusfeel of a handful of wasabi peas no its not that complex but its a nice treat for people who enjoy wasabi flavored snacksi am utterly amazed that lindt have launched this product it tastes really horrible and i cant imagine anyone liking it its provided a bit of fun though when asking other family members to try it and then see their reactionabsolutely revoltingjust tried this for the first time  bought it on impulse when i saw it in tesco loved it and will be buying moreat first i loved the wrapping very tempting i did not know what wasabi was but presumed some kind of fruit i was so horrified and angry when i tasted it i though this is a joke for sure i was going to go back demand my money back but i consoled myself with the fact i should have googled wasabi first and with times tough etc i nibbled away on it over a few days rather than chuck it out and have to say  you clever feckers it works in a weird way and i am tempted to buy it again what do ya knowour tesco was selling this lindt wasabi chocolate for pence a bar  i should have smelt a rat at that  ridiculously low price but a sucker for a bargain i bought two bars  what a grave mistake  lindt which normally produces really delicious chocolate  made a massive mistake with this concoction  it was absolutely vile quite sick making and gut renchingwe have a humane rat trap which we use occasionally because we live in a very rural location in pembrokeshire west wales  we often place a small amount of chocolate in the trap which gets the rats slavering at the mouth and they cant get into the cage fast enough  i tried the wasabi as a way of disposing of it without undue waste  the trap has been open for a week now and the rats wont come anywhere near it  shall have to go back to cadburys milk chocolate which is simply delicious is now fair trade and the rats love itplease mr lindt stick to traditional recipesjclittle ealingi broke it up into several peices for men and women at the office and nobody liked it  spit it out and  thought it was ok but would never feel the need to trybuy it again the rest of them thought it was just awful and didnt bother finishing their pieces about  total taste testers  several of us like the chili pepper bar and thought this would be as good i personally love wasabi ate my piece and thought it was fairly grossi also prefer more cacao much less sugar and a little more wasabi i am dissapointed by this lindt productim sorry but its just disgustingggggg really how can people eat this its taste like shit seriously like rabbit poop dont try it unhealthyjust tried this for the first time  first reaction was disgust but its growing on me since im too cheap to throw it awaygenerally agree that its too sweet  also using wasabi flavouring instead of extract is missing the entire point of using wasabi in the first place since you want it for both the flavour and the heat  same goes with chilli chocolates not much point in a chilli flavoured chocolate bari think i will stick to chilli chocolate though  i think the flavour of real wasabi is a little overpowering and puts the chocolate in the back seat when i believe the chocolate flavour should be the dominant flavouroverall bad concept  although anything can grow on you if you consume enough of itcan lindt refund me for this terrible choc send me a more decent one
this rather elegantly labelled bottle contains an aromatised red wine drink or as the makers prefer to put it a deep ruby red wine blended with rich velvety chocolate flavouring theres a little sweetdry chart on the back and the arrow is almost right at the sweet end checking the ingredients i find that only  of whats in the bottle is wine additional ingredients are sugar and chocolate flavouring as well as some preservatives and that had me worried if adding  salt to a bar of chocolate can radically change the flavour what would up to  sugar do to a bottle of wineaccording to the label this drink has inviting aromas of black cherry and dark cocoa with notes of creamy mocha lingering on a smooth finish in the glass it looks like any other wine but even while pouring it i was immediately aware of the black cherry aromas coming from the wine it smelled like a slightly boozy black forest gateau my first mouthful confirmed what i had suspected about the sweetness with the cherry flavour sitting right on top of a fairly light wine its certainly sweeter than any wine i have drunk in a long time but not overpoweringly so the finish is a combination of vanilla cherries and wine and taken in the context of a glass of wine its a little odd taken in the context of a glass of chocolatey booze its less disturbing and kind of pleasant although i doubt i could go a second glass  its far too sweet for thatas a sweet dessert wine possibly eaten with fruit or some sort of sticky sugary pudding i think this would probably go down quite well with a lot of people drunk on its own the high sugar content and unusual flavour make it hard to take more than a small glass i suppose it would make the perfect companion drink to a classic black forest gateau but youd never get away with having this alongside a cheeseboardworth trying for the novelty value but this is never going to become a regular purchase  for me at leastfunny i too tried this wine this past weekendi am not particularly fond of it either we had it with dessert of a raspberry souffle and a marble icecream cake it didnt go exceptionally well with either and i definitely wouldnt buy it again nor would i recommend iti too dont understand why you would have it withdessert this wine is best enjoyed on its owni pick this wine  up a few weeks ago it was not what i thought it was going to taste like will not buy again but to use it up i add it to my beef dishes the low and slow kind also chilli i hate to waste moneyvery different nice t o try would not buy often loli was so skeptical about this wine  friends in the us were raving about it and i have to admit to being a bit of a snob about it i like good quality australian cabernet shiraz or a merlot and really honestly gave them such a hard time about red wine and chocolate and thinking what a gimmick this was going to be i saw it on special xmas last year in the cop at  a bottle and figured may as well try it i had to eat a big piece of that humble pie and apologise to the friends openly on fb as that is where i had scorned them for drinking what i considered to be cheap trashy wine  i love it   i only ever have one glass mind you as it is fairly sweet but not unpleasantly so  i have tasted far sweeter and i do not like any sweet wine as a rule and would not ever pay more than that price for it  its my indulgence  when i fancy a bit of choc or a glass of wine i can get my kick from this one thing  i found it to be very smooth  i get the red wine taste first the aroma of choc first and then the blend well it works for me is all i can say and yes i would agree its an acquired taste  my dad who was a bit of a red wine connoisseur would most likely have poured it down the drain and teased me for liking it but i am not professing to be anything like the review above i like what i like  i usually buy lindemanns or hardys be open minded you never knowi learned the lesson about not knocking something til you try it what is we preach to our children i bought this as it was on offer and thought the label was ok although sceptical i thought i could cook with it in worst case on opening the bottle the smell was overwhelming yuck i thought my boyfriend and i tried drinking it but it was too horrible for words glasses of wine poured straight down the sink i cant bear to ruin a good pear in poaching in this stuff when i can bear to open the bottle again the rest will be going down the sink unless i hear of a better use like fertiliseryummysuperi live permanently in france and love both wine and chocolate i was given a bottle of  chocolate lovers wine at christmas and put it to one side to try after the excesses of the new year i got around to tasting it today and oh dear it tastes neither like good wine or good chocolate imanaged a couple of sips the second to confirm that it was as awful as the first and poured the rest down the sink my wife just sniffed at hers and tipped it into the sink without tasting it from the other comments i have read it seems that this is not a greatly appealing product a shame really as i suppose a lot of time and effort went into creating it ah well no lives lost i certainly wont try it againits absolutely disgustingive read several good stuff here definitely value bookmarking for revisiting i surprise how much attempt you put to make one of these magnificent informative websiteyummy  love this wine so glad when i see it on the shelf at my local coop or sainsburyssurprised at all the negative comments on this wine i love love love it so any spare bottles will be greatly appreciated message me for address xi love chocolate shop one of my friends turned me on to it a  little over a year ago and every friday i stop and buy a bottle  love the taste  it goes down smooth and i drink it alone as well as with various meals
in my third selection from zorbas we have three square brown boxes each containing two each of two truffle flavors the truffles are in clear bags nesting in very finely shredded paper and gold strips i particularly like the addition of the gold as it gives a twist of elegance to the usual ecochic style the truffles are all fairly basic looking dark chocolate squares topped off with things like salt coffee beans and shredded coconut no complaints in appearance the six flavors are espresso olive oilsea salt rose vanilla ginger snap and cayenne coconut their chocolate is very dark and very rich which works better with some of the flavors than others the espresso truffle i find swoonworthy its pairing is perfection and while it does have some coffee grains i cant say i mind when the truffle already has a rougher more crumbly kind of texture the olive oilsea salt was a little freaky for my tastes though still intriguing and rose is a flavor everyone either likes or doesnti hit a road block when i got to the vanilla truffle initially it completely confused me in the midst of all that dark chocolate is an exceedingly feminine oldfashioned ice cream type of vanilla flavor on top of that is the flavor from the salt garnish im feeling much better about the truffle now but i really want the salt out of the picture the allconsuming strength of the vanilla probably the most potent ive tasted is enoughi had to stop imagining the ginger snap as a milk chocolate which isnt going to happen with a raw company and really isnt even necessary for this truffle there is a better flavor balance here with the ginger spiced to a level like a strong cookie would have the cayenne coconut truffle is like playing hideandseek with the cayenne but the coconut is amazingly fresh theres a warmcool effect thats satisfactory enough so i suppose i ended up more comfortable with this one than i had expected tothe fact is these truffles may be harder to get into for the regular population not only because of their more crumbly raw texture but also because zorbas goes for the slightly exotic flavor combinations yet neither of these is a bad thing as i said for the other raw truffles just assess first if raw chocolates flavored this way are your stylecomments are closed
canadian winters are impressive snow falls in substantial amounts and it stays for a long time  four months where i live  and it can also be damned cold even when the snow isnt falling so it makes perfect sense that canada would be one of the biggest producers of something called icewine for the uninitiated icewine is made by taking grapes that have actually been frozen on the vine not really a problem in canada it freezes all the water in the grapes and helps to create a very very sweet dessert wine that is a bit of an acquired taste  thats a good thing because it is also rather expensive so it makes perfect sense that some canadian chocolate company would do something with the wealth of icewine made in this frozen wasteland i live in the filling is really lovely theres an initial burst of sweetness that comes from the wine but as it fades theres something waiting to take its place cognac the very clever addition of cognac is why this is so delicious  it means the booziness hangs around for a satisfyingly long time there really isnt anything to complain about here at all  this is a tasty bar of chocolate which i would happily eat again or rather will happily eat again ive never tried ice wine but ive read about it and i really like the idea of using it in chocolate its kind of patriotic the design of the wrapper and bar is gorgeous too
theres also a lovely little story about the chocolate makers attempts to milk a cow called marigold luckily for us his attempts were unsuccessful and he went back to making chocolate insteadthe format of the bar is the same as the other bars  its a very thin glossy slab that looks great despite the lack of chunks its very easy to break off pieces in any sizetheres a slightly grainy texture to the chocolate and the flavour is a bit unusual for me took a moment to get used to and my instant reaction was that i didnt like it too much the chocolate has a nice flavour but it doesnt quite sit with the creamy flavour of the milk the result is that you can taste the chocolate and you can taste the milk but they dont immediately sit well with each otheri did find that after my first couple of pieces the flavour seemed to come together more and i picked up a lot of caramel notes and after not being keen on it at first i ended up really enjoying it within a very short amount of time half the bar was gone coming back to it the next day my experience was similar  i enjoyed each piece a little more than the lastcomments are closed
as well as being about as organic and fairtrade as its possible to get zotter decided that a small proportion of the profits from sales of this bar should go into a reforestation project in laos  another reason to go out and buy one of these for yourself but be warned theres nothing dark and mysterious about this bar its light fruity and sweet and as such fits very well with this time of year a week of rain exceptedi love zotter for their unfettered imaginations and their commitment to ethical chocolate the only zotter bar ive ever knowingly avoided is their bacon bits bar and thats only because im vegetarian this sounds like another winner despite the sweetness
red white  blue marbles sir hans sloane are quite well known for their patriotic chocolate novelties so its no surprise that this little bag of marbles has been produced to coincide with the jubilee now personally i dont know anyone who is celebrating that but clearly some people do or there wouldnt be a market for them me im just in it of for the chocolateas you might have guessed these are really white chocolate but rather than simply being coloured the white chocolate is conched with strawberry and blackcurrant the result is a very pleasant glossy marbled effect and a hint of flavour to the red and blue marblesbut these arent just solid balls inside each one is a small piece of speculoos biscuit that gives a very satisfying crunch not unlike a malteser although theres more chocolate than crunch herecombine the crunchiness with the subtle flavours and the result is a tasty snack thats quite difficult to stop eatingso despite not celebrating the jubilee id be quite happy to munch on these all day thankfully for the sake of my own health they only sent me this one bagfinally heres a short interview with sir hans sloanes chocolatier bill mccarrick talking about his marbles and the rest of their current rangecomments are closed
as you can see the bars have a distinctive moulding with a pleasing curved effect to the chunks and a nice glossy finishi tried the rio caribe first it has a nice deep aroma and the first thing you notice when you bite into a chunk is that it has a surprising sweetness the flavour builds as the chocolate melts with some rich earthy notes but not a great deal of complexity although i did pick up some fruity notes toward the endthe chocolate has a very smooth texture and it melts evenly and slowly the chunks are a little big and difficult to break if all you want is a small piece but once you do manage to break a chunk in half its quite nice to let it melt slowly on the tonguethe caranero has a much lighter flavour with less of the earthy more bitter notes of the other bar it has a more complex and delicate flavour with a bit of woodiness and some flowery notes this one is very easy to eatboth these bars demand to be consumed slowly at  theyre not bars you can eat quickly anyway in terms of quality theyre not the finest of the fine but they are very interesting  particularly if you can get both varieties and do a little comparison yourselftheyre not available to buy online at the moment but according to their website they are available at a number of locations around san francisco and if youre further afield drop them an email and im sure theyll be happy to helpi had never worn leggings berofe but this winter has led me to look for more warmth and i am really glad i tried the ones from my italian closet despite my misgivings about them stretching to my size they fitted easily stay in place and actually hold my tummy in nicely not being a skirt person i wear them under trousers for that extra warmth i love the colour range and feel they are a really good price which meant i could buy  pairs to rotate i have also bought some for presents great for people with winter birthdays
now heres something a little bit special  chocolate made from criollo beans harvested from trees which can be traced back for almost a thousand years making them genetically about as old as its possible to get as it says on the box lid pure and wild and the ten pieces of chocolate in this rather lovely and very scandinavian looking box are about as pure as youre going to get being made of nothing more than cacao and sugar its also worth noting that this chocolate won a silver at the academy of chocolate awards in before you get to the chocolate you are presented with a fact sheet as i unfolded this rather extensive piece of paper i was reminded of ordnance survey maps or old record sleeve inserts  the thing just kept expanding it tells the story of the meeting between rasmus bo bojesen and marcela baldivieso and the subsequent exporting of beans from bolivia and the benefits to local villagers you also get a few reviews and some artwork to enjoy while you lift the lid and admire the neatly arranged individually wrapped g tablets of chocolate that await your pleasureso how does the grandmother of all cacao taste i hear you ask my answer would be chocolatey with a straight  split between cacao and sugar the first taste is sweet and then as the chocolate melts the depth of flavour from the beans unfurls over your palate the smell of this chocolate hints at fruity hazelnut flavours and this is largely borne out when tasting theres a good dose of red berries in there with a light floral top note that lingers to the finish the mouthfeel is slightly grainy but not in an unpleasant way think of it as part of the earthiness of the overall taste experience the finish is woody with a hint of spice and very pleasantthat said i do think that for a premium price and believe me this is a premium chocolate i would have expected more from oialla when i said that it tasted chocolatey thats what it does there are flavours lurking in the depths but they never really get to burst forth in the way that manufacturers like duffy sheardown seem to do if i were looking to pay top price for chocolate i would expect something impressive memorable  exceptional and im afraid orialla didnt quite come up to that standardfinally heres our interview with rasmus bojesen at last years salon du chocolat in parisi havent tasted either but i would definitely like to try any thing with criolloi hope you didnt have to pay at  for g of chocolate is the most expensive stuff ive heard ofwhere do you get  fromhttpwwwbojesendkoiallachocolatecriolloaspxhuge mistake when i translated it looked like euro rather than krone  is much more affordable though still incredibly expensivechocablog please do some homework instead of reciting promotional marketing these cocoa beans are not genetically criollo there are good online resources now that have already reviewed this bar and that have good info about cacao typesadditionally i never thought id hear someone object to chocolatey flavor how many bars contain only cocoa and sugar and taste purely chocolatey far fewer than you thinki think you should consider getting out more its just a chocolate reviewplease explain dom what you mean by getting out moreas for its just a chocolate review thanks for putting it in perspective but i read here  there about really good chocolate being like fine wine and i never hear wine connoisseurs say its just winewere well aware of the issues surrounding the use of the word criollo and the endless genetic variations of cacao i take the view that the word is used here in a more colloquial senseas simon says wed probably take you more seriously if you werent so ruderonyou seem to have taken it upon yourself to act as some sort of naysayer passing judgement on reviews and being hyper critical perhaps youd care to tell us more about yourself and put into perspective what qualifies you to be so rudeplease excuse me if i came off rudely im just trying to shine a light on truth if that is ever possible sometimes the facts messy as they may be get in the way of politenessmy qualifications simon are probably the same as yours i have none other than eating lots of chocolate when someone says they are an expert at this or that take it with a grain of salt because the deeper one gets into almost any subject the more one figures out that there is so much more to learn and know great minds from plato to einstein understood thismaybe zen master linji summed it up best if you meet the buddha on the road kill himnow can we get to the substance of the issues for starters doms comment about criollo i take the view that the word is used here in a more colloquial sensei take that means native so can we now accept that any native cocoa can be labeled criollo does this also mean that some noncolloquial criollo in venezuela is not criollo because it may have been transplanted from central america or is criollo now just marketing hype the very name has a reputation something that sells well where do we draw the linehaving just tasted this chocolate boss brought me one from a meeting today i have to say that the pureness of the chocolatey feeling you describe in the text above in itself was a wonderful feeling being somewhat of a self educated connoisseur id have to admit that this is a chocolate id gladly pay the extra buck or two for and not a chocolate id share with just anyonethree of these and a wide finger of cardhu in a tumbler and ill be quiet for the next half hourcardhu because its probably the only single malt i know thats equally pure in tastehello morteni just wanted toi thank you for you kind comments i try very hard to convey as much as i can about how something tastes and knowing that i got it right makes it all worthwhilei think you nailed it pretty spot on although i dont quite agree that this taste isnt memorable i think it is  but that is of course a matter of personal taste i just saw on their website that you can buy a  lb block of this chocolate for just shy of usd  in my book that is amazingly good value for money now all i have to do is figure out who is to have a seriously tasty xmas present this year 
the chocolate itself is actually made in switzerland from fair trade organic beans and has a lovely robust flavour in fact is almost a little too fullbodied for the other flavours in that it immediately dominates and doesnt really give the banana or toffee much room to manoeuvre but slowly the subtle banana begins to reveal itself and then lurks in the background without ever getting close to overwhelmingand even the addition of some pieces of banana chips doesnt ramp up the banananess of it all to that potentially dangerous level  they provide more texture than flavour the many little chunks of toffee on the other hand give bursts of flavour and plenty of crunch too i didnt really sense much of the salt that was supposedly through the toffee and thats a pity because when it was there the salt really did add another dimensionso i liked this quite a bit despite the subtleness of the flavours or more likely because of the subtleness of the flavours im not sure that i really got any of the stress relief it promised and it didnt wake me up more than any caffeineladen chocolate did but i would never buy a bar of chocolate for those reasons as a simple bar of chocolate its unique flavour combination delivered for me and that is all that matters to me we appreciate your review and are glad you enjoyed the chocolate however we would like to clarify the position of our company while zazubean is a fun brand at the core we are are missionbased company zazubean is committed to delivering super tasting fairtrade organic chocolate with ingredients that enhance cacaos natural properties our company started years ago in recognition that we personally consumed chocolate more at certain times and we wanted a bar that met our needs on all levelsbeing not only tasty but also as good for us the growers  the land as possible at the time there were limited fair trade options  virtually nothing certified both organic  fairtrade today the market has changed and fortunately more ethical options are available though zazubean still uniquely offers great flavours with additional superfoods that enhance the chocolate experience
there are six in all with flavor labels on a rather pretty piece of paper all except for the plain truffle have color swiped on top the orange is the only of these that doesnt also include a little shine i rather wish it did as the effect of the colored shimmer enhances a metaphor of truffles as jewels it also lets the truffles in their simple molds sit with a pleasing combination of handmade and elegantin the green is a rosemary truffle its ganache is very smooth and very meltable and its flavor is light its more like a minty accent than a strong herbal element contrarily the red cabernet sauvignon has quite more pronounced of a flavor but still in a balanced waypainted orange the balsamic caramel strikes up curiosity inside the chocolate shell is a freeflowing caramel so this isnt one to split into many small bites the bite the balsamic vinegar gives is not entirely what like the presentlypopular salt does yet tasting both balsamic vinegar and sweet caramel molded together in one flavor is disconcerting at first i cant decide from just one chocolate whether this taste is intriguingly innovative of unappetizing however the mere question has made it an interesting experiencethe raspberry truffle is another nicelybalanced one with the richness of the raspberry which tastes true fitting well into the ganache the orange truffle turns out to be one of the orange chocolates im fairly content with perhaps because it is almost more fruity than orangey the orange flavor is pronounced without necessarily being strongi ended with the truffle that probably ought to have been the first the plain one the colors and flavors must have gotten me too excited to start with it in any case this simple nice truffle exemplifies the smooth ganache all of these have excepting the balsamic caramel of course the chocolate shells are all quite thin which works with the style here it adds to the delicate laidback effect since the chocolate is light in flavor i wouldnt put it higher than a midrange cocoa percentage this is one of the factors that make these truffles all too easy to keep eating including the plain whose melting i rather lamentedthis is a nice start for creative confections there are some classic flavors but also a willingness to experiment the balance of sweet and rich with neither crossing the line could mean a wide appeal neither am i sensing fillers or artificial taints i can see this company coming to carve out its own nichecomments are closed
have you ever eaten black truffle if you have then im sure you know how strong a flavour they have not something one would necessarily associate with fine chocolate but of course if someone like the mast brothers offer it as part of their range you know its going to work the origins of the beans in this bar remain a mystery which is the case for almost all of the mast bars and its a little strange given that if you take one of their factory tours you are presented with the whole range of beans they use in their bars and allowed to taste each individual variety when it comes to the bars themselves though no information is given about which beans were used in which bar and in what quantitieshow did i feel about this bar personally i liked it a lot i might even go as far as saying its one of my favourite mast brothers bars but id be hard pressed to say it was an absolute favourite its certainly unusual definitely grown up chocolate and absolutely worth tracking down if you like your sweetness tempered with a little salt and some dark earthy flavoursi bought a bar of this when i went over to ny ive got a review of it coming up sooni agree it is delicious and may be one of my top bars up theresounds like my sort of chocolate bar  love truffles love salt in chocolate love dark chocolate altogetherwhat i find so amazing  fascinating about chocolate are the different viewpoints on it for example another site wrote this about this barthe dearness of it all chocolate  black truffle tuber melonosporum add saltking of the fungi the stuff of gunfights thefts fraud mysterious disappearances of hogs  highly trained dogsbrillatsavarin called truffles the kitchen diamond  this bar just cuts them into pulverized dust then hydrolized in an acid bath in a kind of culinary blood diamondsfantastic beginning falls prey to a flawed but wellintended blueprint deploying madagascar cacos brightness to counter those earthen ground truffles which pose a natural choice due to their own inherent chocolate flavor unclear whether these hail from their ancestral grounds in  around var  perigord france or of the summer variety which come from northwest usaan inauspicious caco crop of ripping acidity seen in full view from masts madagascar  offers far too much contrast compounded by hamhanded blatancy with the truffles  salt  the whole contrivance clashing about with the dexterity of a truffle hog trying to play drums by mostly hitting cymbalsjust about any other origin at the moment save for ecuador would complement  harmonize this to a greater degreea bar best suited for jaded souls whove had enough of the purist chocolate pursuit  need to head in a renewed direction pairing caco with anything  everything they can get their mitts on like stinking cheese  fat salamis between swigs of bordeauxi recently blogged this one myself mine had prettier gold blue wrapping p  and must admit that it didnt float my boat as much as id hoped it would i think this was due not only to the musty strength of the truffle but the acidity of the chocolate itself whereas i prefer earthier woodsier chocolate funny thing is and admittedly it wasnt a huge testing panel i tried this on i found that men seemed to love this one and women found it a bit too stinky tastewise
this all sounds very fine and idealistic so i had high hopes of an exceptional product sadly ive ended up pretty disappointed i even gave this a decent chance opening it on a warm latesummer day when aroma and flavour should have been released quickly and easilyas you can see from the photo there are is a fair bit of nut showing from the back of the block  the labels says almonds are  the block is simply formed and compares to other commercial products from there though its pretty much downhillthe chocolate is quite hard and has little aroma it melts slowly and during eating it develops very little flavour the nuts are not very nuttythis chocolate should be good  use of unrefined cane sugar should give a sweetish fruity  earthy tone but its not there the almonds could have been roasted or better toasted or something to lift their flavour and crunch the chocolate perhaps would benefit from some blending its very unkind but the best analogy i can come up with is that this chocolate is comparable to eating vaguely cocoa flavoured cardboard ok thats a bit harsh but you get the idea the texture is disappointing the flavour and aroma are disappointing the whole experience is disappointing  and especially so when this is about  times the price of a comparable block of lindtcomments are closed
the first thing i noticed about this bar was the packaging the simple translucent paper showing a card insert underneath is a step up from the rustic askonosie packaging im used to but still retains a handmade feelthe second thing i noticed is that theres no cocoa bean origin listed anywhere on the packaging more surprisingly theres no cocoa percentage listed either thats very unusual for a beantobar chocolate maker like askinosie so i can only assume its by design rather than an oversightas you can see its a beautiful looking bar following askinosies usual format of oneletterpersquare with a rich dark colour and beautifully glossy finish its almost a shame to break into iti really like the flavour after an initial fruity dark chocolate burst the flavour evens out to a rich smooth malted milk its not sweet thanks to the hefty cocoa content but it is very smooth and creamy theres a very slightly bitter aftertaste but not an unpleasant one  its just enough to make you want another piecethe malted milk powder works so well with this particular chocolate and the result is something that really stands out from the crowd and i cant stop eating itcertainly one of my favourite dark milk chocolates and well worth seeking outive been eying that bar at the shop near my office for a couple of months its  so ive been hesitant to pick it up though i did get the licorice bar and quite liked it i tried askinosies malted moo moo a couple of years ago and was really disappointed httpwwwflickrcomphotostypetivesounds like a tasty bar can imagine the malty milk powder works really wellmay have to hunt some of this down
the varieties aremilk chocolate egg with white chocolate buttons and italian brownie piecesi dont know what makes a brownie italian or if these particular brownie pieces have ever been anywhere near italy but theyre nice enough a little dry and cakey but youre never going to get moist fresh brownies stuck to the front of a mass produced easter egg theyre nice enough thoughthe milk chocolate in all these eggs is  cocoa solids and above average for an easter egg its creamy and smooth but doesnt have much depth its quite easy to eat thoughdark chocolate with australian crystalised ginger and white chocolate buttonsthe only dark chocolate egg in the box and its a bit disappointing its  cocoa solids and probably the sweetest dark chocolate ive ever tasted in fact its almost as sweet as the white chocolate that decorates this egg apart from sugar theres no real flavour to the chocolate at all the saving grace of this egg is the ginger pieces which despite being difficult to get to through the thick layer of white chocolate ar quite tasty and spicymilk chocolate with white chocolate buttons and milk chocolate coated raisinsthe same milk chocolate with some chocolate covered raisins i love chocolate raisins so was disappointed that there just arent that many here the raisins arent bad but as with all these eggs it just needs morewhite chocolate with sour cherry and white chocolate crispy piecesthe white chocolate is too sweet for me here but i do quite like the decoration the flavoured chocolate area and cherries themselves are actually quite tasty and the crispy pieces adds a nice bit of crunch definitely needs more cherries thoughmilk chocolate with white chocolate covered meringue piecesmore of the same chocolate weve seen in the other eggs with a bit of texture added by the meringue you have been lucky to find these  none of the ms stores i have tried have had them left in stock  one of the perils of featuring them in the tv advert i guessshame they arent as good as they look  but i would have liked to have tried for myselfhow much are theyam i the only one who cant even look at these eggs without wanting to be sick let alone eat one sorry to be a bit gross but the whitepink one looks like rotting fruit or a wound infested with maggots actually i know im not the only one as when my mum and i saw them in the advert we both went agh and i just showed it to my boyfriend and his reaction was similar could they perhaps have been pulled from sale because of thisnope i think its just youwhat lol just you i agree
something a little different from paul a young this time no exotic flavour combinations here just a simple box of eggs for an easter egg hunteach  box contains nine eggs three large hand decorated eggs three sugar coated ganache mini eggs and three wrapped praline mini eggs everything is very simply packaged with just some shredded purple paper to protect the eggs it doesnt seem like it should be enough protection but it did a perfectly good job of keeping my eggs safe on the combination of trains and buses i took to get these homefirst off forget the large eggs these little sugar coated beauties are amazing not only do they look exactly like real quails eggs but they have the perfect texture and flavour the best thing about them is the extra thick sugar shell which means you have to either put some effort into biting them or just stuff the whole thing into your mouth in one go and let the shell melt revealing the soft milk chocolate ganache underneath i could very easily become addicted to thesethe praline mini eggs are lovely but just dont quite do it for me in the same waythe three larger eggs are milk dark and white chocolate the white chocolate egg painted pink is as you might expect too sweet for my tastes but something the kids will probably love the milk chocolate egg has a caramel flavouring to it and its surprisingly good it has a nice thick shell and the kind of chocolate i could eat all day  and then feel guilty about afterwardthe dark chocolate egg is thinner and unflavoured but packed with natural fruity notes its not often you find a dark chocolate easter egg made with real chocolate with natural flavour notesthis is a visually impressive and delicious easter egg hunt kit but im not sure i would actually use the eggs for a real easter egg hunt i wouldnt want to risk my paul a young eggs by leaving them lying around but if you have a small family or just want some great chocolate to share with your partner this easter then this could be the perfect solution its much nicer than any mass produced eggcomments are closed
easter clam yes easter clamopen the box and unwrap the tissue paper and what you find inside is this rather beautiful looking milk chocolate shell it has a nice amount of weight to it and a nice glossy finishinside youll see why this is truly an easter chocolate gifttwelve mini eggs lightly stuck to the lower half of the shell so they dont move around and each handpainted in a different colour obviously designed to look like pearls in an oyster the effect is both surprising and unique each egg has a different filling made with a a variety of fruit purees caramels the flavours include devon strawberry oxfordshire plums somerset apricot yorkshire rhubarb scottish raspberry and cornish sea saltsome of them are a little sweet for my liking but others are very moreish i just wish there was a way of fitting more eggs inside a clami really like chocolatiers who do something a little bit different and this is certainly different from your average hollow egg yet retains an easter theme at  its pretty good value for a handmade chocolate gift of this size toocomments are closed
the packaging looks pretty good too with its  degree clear pastic pyramid showing off the egg in the best possible way   unfortunately its an absolute pig to open im sure theres a proper way to get the box open but i couldnt find it and ended up having to take scissors to it and cut all around the egg i really wish these things were better thought outthe egg itself is milk chocolate covered in a matt velvety finish that looks very nice indeed it is completely hollow but the base contains  golden chocolate pearls which set it off quite nicelythe golden balls are quite pleasant theyre white chocolate with a milk chocolate praline centre theyre sweet but not too sweet so theyre quite easy to eatthe milk chocolate of the egg itself is ok but not amazing its creamy and sweet and at  cocoa solids well above average for a supermarket easter egg it does lack a lot of depth of flavour though so its still not a chocolate i would buy for myselfcomments are closed
at one point it looked as though the company was slowly dragging itself into the st century with higher end better quality products but over the last year or so i get the general impression thats no longer a priority as the company has been fighting for its very survival unfortunately its the higherend chocolate that seems to have suffered most during this time and lately theres been little from thorntons that has truly excited me but i know many wonderful people at thorntons who are talented and forward thinking and if anyone can turn things around again its them so i was secretly quite excited when i came home to find this nice looking egg literally waiting for me on my doorstep its part of a range of great british dessert eggs the others in the range being eton mess and lemon meringuethe front of the egg contains a nice window of sliced dried banana and special toffee and the rest of the egg has smaller pieces of toffee embedded in itbanana in chocolate can be a hit or miss affair but i like it in this egg the pieces of real banana are crunchy and tasty i found myself eating the front of the egg first then wishing for more the rest of the chocolate is thick creamy and quite tasty its sweet but certainly above average for an easter egg shell and something i could quite happily nibble on over the course of an easter afternoon the little pieces of crunchy special toffee scattered throughout the shell work well and the overall flavour is surprisingly reminiscent of the dessert the egg is imitatingthere are no other chocolates with this particular egg but frankly you dont need them theres plenty of substance and just enough flavour and style to keep all but the fussiest chocoholic happy this easterthat looks divine
each of the  eggs in the box is divided in half with a different filling in each halfthere are four varieties of egg in the boxvenezuelan dark chocolate ganache  pecan feullantinea smooth dark ganache with a crunchy nutty feullantine a great contrast of textures and flavours with the sweetness of the feullantine complementing the dark ganache very nicelytonka bean caramel  venezuelan dark chocolate ganachethe same dark ganache is paired with a tasty tonka bean caramel in this egg im a bit of a fan of tonka bean and it works very well in a caramel giving an extra dimension to the flavour its a little like a burnt caramel flavour but more subtle again the sweetness is nicely complemented with dark ganachepistachio dark chocolate ganache  pistachio marzipani love pistachio and i love marzipan so it goes without saying i love this egg theres a perfect flavour balance and lovely colour to te fillingsea salt caramel  hazelnut feullantinethe sweetest of the selection but also perhaps my favourite subtle salted caramel with a deliciously crunchy hazelnut feullantine work perfectly and make this egg irresistiblei love this innovative easter collection im a big fan of filled eggs over large cheap hollow eggs anyway but the concept style and execution of this particular collection makes it the perfect easter gift for any real chocolate lover highly recommendedpistachio and marzipan are probably two of my all time favourite ingredients must get me some of thosebut matcha arent trading any more this website is sooooo out of date sometimes
i love the elegant simplicity of the packaging the beautifully simple bar design and of course the wonderful chocolateas you can see from the back of the photo above the other thing this bar has is nibs lots of nibsthe chocolate doesnt have a perfectly smooth texture thanks to the cinnamon and shorter conche time but its packed with flavour theres an orangeyness that complements the natural fruitiness of the chocolate and just a hint of spice the nibs give it a great crunch and i particularly like how theyre swirled over only about half the area of the bar so its easy to break off a piece without nibs if you dont want to be awake all nightcomments are closed
whats immediately noticeable about this particular bar is the acidity as soon as a piece of this bar hits your tongue youre hit with vibrant citrus and green wood notes the chocolate itself has a smoother texture than the conacado bar and that acidity just keeps on coming the nibs are best kept to last let the chocolate melt away before biting down on them and you get to finish the taste experience with deeper earthier cacao flavours which are a surprising contrast to all of that nature waltzing over your palatefor a  bar its surprisingly light but with a very long finish the cacao lingers on the palate beautifully making the nib nibbling process that little bit more enjoyable as the new earthy flavours join in with the last of the original chocolatei found myself liking this a lot despite my initial surprise at just how vibrant and acidic the chocolate was i definitely thought it had more going on than the conacado bar  but it still isnt my favourite mast brothers bar we can only hope that now the brothers have expanded their store and prodcution area that they can produce enough to start a small supply line to the uk in the not too distant future the world would be a better place for itcmon chocoblogger experts its quite ok to open your mouth before thinking how else will you be able to taste but the masts dont need to advertise the origin on this because the flavor gives it awayyoure now permitted to thinkflavour doesnt always give origin or variety away by any means as the flavour has as much to do with how the beans are processed as where they were grownbut its still important to ask questions as to where your food comes fromwe now tag chocolates based on bean origins  i have been asked to mention this in my reviews i thought it worth mentioning that the product information doesnt specify bean originsuh but we come here for expert advice so surely you can discern the origin based on taste especially one so glaringly obvious every unique company leaves a particular makers mark on a bar in terms of how its processed cross that by the genetic  terroir signature of the origin  voila the answer often lies clearly within cmon now dom lets put the clues together  solve it
lord dark toffiusas you might guess from the name this is a dark chocolate egg with a toffee  well caramel  filling as with all these eggs the filling is actually inside the shell sandwiched between two layers of chocolatedespite being dark chocolate this is quite sweet primarily because of the sticky toffee shell filling there isnt much of it but its pretty good sir namon chaithis is a milk chocolate egg with a spiced ganache filling to the egg unfortunately nowhere on the box does it say what the spices are the ingredients simply list them as ground spices not irradiated which is a little odd nice enough but a little too sweet for memonsieur coco noira dark chocolate egg with coconut marshmallow in the shell i quite enjoyed this one the marshmallow isnt too sweet and its very easy to eat most all of the egg in one goas you can see from the picture above actually breaking into these eggs isnt easy on every attempt at cutting the eggs neatly they broken into many sticky pieces so really the only way to eat them is in one goduke of nutting hazelmilk chocolate egg with hazelnut praline very sweet and nutty with a little bit of crunch from the large pieces of nut in the praline tasty and sweet reminds me of a snickers particularly when tasted at the same time as the caramel eggoverall an interesting collection of eggs but as is often the case with luckys the price is still high for what they are at  for a g egg youre paying about p per gram of chocolate and despite the use of valrhona im not sure they can be called fine chocolate  especially as valrhona itself seems to be having a lot of quality issues at the momentif they were sold as confectionery at half the price id recommend them more but as it stands theyre borderline recommended only for those with deep pockets who want to give something a little different this easter and really only for those with a sweet toothcomments are closed
making one of my rounds through the shelves of world market i paused at this previously unseen line four or five bars sat there waving hello to me i got that feeling where your eye starts to curl up into a smile and you know this find can be special it would have been easy to gather up all the bars like a bouquet their colors and designs complemented each other so well but as theyre in the upper price range at  for  grams i started with just one obviously it was the expressive cowgirl style of the packaging that got my attention living in the southwest and seeing many blandly badly designed tourist items products that hold their own western look are lovely to find and if done correctly the combination of western with feminine is just fun the bar i chose is very simple though still inyourface in design with its western lettering in bold pink sitting on a reddishbrown background with the outline of a chili pepper and the company logo somehow too the range gives off the aura that it uses natural ingredientsso im still intrigued i would certainly six years ago have rather purchased this bar at a store selling pottery and other such southwestern items than one called route  or something similarthat one was terrible while this one is expressive now i only have four left to trycomments are closed
whats not to love about chococo brightly coloured packaging containing and their insistance on using real chocolate and quality ingredients means youre never going to be disappointed with them whatever you buythis egg is hand decorated with edible gold of course all gold is edible but it always tastes better when its covered in chocolateunderneath the surface of this particular golden egg lies a secret not a golden goose but tiny pieces of freeze dried raspberry and strawberry theres no other filling or goodies inside so this is all about the chocolate and the fruiti do like the grenada chocolate but in terms of flavour its not the most complex and exciting chocolate in the world those with a sweet tooth might find this  version a little hard going as theres not much sweetness to the chocolate itselfthe plentiful supply of fruit does help with sweetness but even with that this is something for lovers of the dark side as shocking as it sounds id have preferred to have seen something with a slightly lower cocoa content or even a milk chocolate version of this egg i found myself picking at this chocolate without thinking over the course of an afternoon but never really wanted to take a big chunk out of itthe freeze dried fruits are great building in flavour as they melt in your mouth but this is really an egg for those who dont generally go for sugary easter treats if youre looking for something a bit sweeter we have more reviews of chococo goodies and plenty more easter gifts in the pipelinecomments are closed
as a result this chocolate has been finding its way into ice creams and drinks  in new york of course i also have sad news thus far this bar isnt easily available unless you happen to find yourself in new york or like me have a friend who recently went there on business and had just enough time to pop in to their new shop to buy about  assorted barswrapped in classic mast brothers wallpaper style the bar itself is an unpretentious plainly moulded slab of dark chocolate which gives off complex aromas of fruit dark sugars and cacao the beans come from plants which are grown alongside bananas and other crops and the tasting notes on the package hint at notes of fresh cherries molasses and strawberrieswould i recommend it yes but not as highly as some of the mast brothers other efforts its undoubtedly good chocolate with a fine pedigree and well worth tasting but i feel that there are other bars that are worth tracking down before this one more on that later
this rather attractive box holds nine chocolates so i decided to fill it with a selection of the pauls newer flavours although i have two of one particular chocolate the chocolates arethis is the chocolate i had two of im very happy with that choice  and my onion breathso another really exciting selection of chocolates the great thing about paul a young is that there really is something for everyone from simple traditional flavours to the challenging and just plain weird whether or not the flavours work for you is down to personal taste more than anything else i love the red onion and stem ginger but im sure it wont be everyones cup of tea you just have to try them for yourselfnow ill start day dreaming about the boozy onesyou need to move to londonoh wow that marmalade one sounds exactly my cup of tea combining two of my favourite things and im fascinated by the onion one  im not usually  a pickle fan but i love ginger and red onions and balsamic vinegar are always fantastic together
last week this little box unexpectedly arrived at my door exactly the kind of surprise i likeinside are four dark chocolate truffles that look something like thisthe truffles use the same manjari chocolate in a ganache made with passion fruit puree the dark chocolate shells are nice and thin and the moment you bite into them the flavour of the ganache bursts through its tangy zingy citrusy and wonderful i love them and if you love fruity citrusy chocolates youll love them tooincredibly jealous thats how i feel after reading and staring at the pictures
the next thing i noticed was that as large as the range is everything seems to be carefully thought out take this tin for example its the kind of thing that you might want to keep long after youve eaten the  mini egg chocolates inside designed with a flat base so it sits nicely at an angle without rolling away its a bit flowery for my own tastes but it would still be a bit of a shame to throw it awaythere are three different chocolates inside the tin  salted caramel pink champagne and a house pralinethe salted caramel is surprisingly good for a mass produced chocolate the milk chocolate shell is maybe a little thick but the soft and sweet caramel inside is very nice indeed ive been spoilt by a lot of handmade artisan salted caramels lately but id still quite happily eat a whole bag full of thesethe milk chocolate praline egg is also very good with a very smooth praline filling im not a big praline fan but i did find myself eating all of these without thinkingfinally the pink champagne egg is just a little sweet for my tastes but it is one of the nicest champagne truffles ive had in a while it tastes of pink so if thats your kind of thing or the recipient of this gifts thing then itll be perfecti actually like this rather a lot when it comes down to it it may just be  mini eggs for  but its simple and elegant and just a little bit different from your average easter eggcomments are closed
housed in a very smart contemporary box the artisan assortment is a handcrafted collection of chocolates that still embraces a lot of the companys traditions for example most of the chocolates are much larger than you might expect although not nearly as large as their signature victoria creams they are also rather plain to look at or maybe understated is a better word but theres nothing wrong with that there arent many percentages thrown around  the dark chocolate comes in at  but no clues about the milk or white varieties  and with a relatively quick best before date there doesnt appear to be too many chemically things used heres a rundown of the different varietieswhile not perfect there is a lot to like about this box and it is definitely worth a try rogers are taking some real risks with the flavour combinations compared to the rest of their range and for the most part it works this is a great example of a company trying to reinvent itself for a new generation and doing a pretty good job of it it will be very interesting to see where they go next comments are closed
the packaging is very simple and precise hand wrapped in foil and recycled paper it feels like an artisan product  a feeling thats echoed in the bar itselfits quite difficult to get a photo of the front of the bar as its one of the glossiest nicely tempered slabs of chocolate ive sene in a long time youll have to trust me that my photos dont do it justicethe only thing breaking up the sheer gloss is the beautiful embossed naive logo its all very stylishthe underside of the bar is covered with salt it doesnt seem like a lot but its immediately noticeable when you taste it theres an intense salty burst before the flavour of the chocolate comes throughbut the chocolate itself tastes wonderful its smooth and melts evenly on the tongue releasing an intensely warm rich flavour it has a natural sweetness with plenty of caramel and vanilla notes in there but theres also a subtle fruitiness to it not citrussy like a madagascan chocolate but much more mellow its some of the nicest african chocolate ive had in a long timeim not convinced that the salt is entirely necessary though maybe theres just a little too much of it but i find it too intense luckily it only rests loosely on the surface and if you brush a little of it off the flavour is amazing just a few crystals of salt bring out the flavour of the chocolate perfectlycomments are closed
the chocolate is produced by  or so growers as part of the acopagro cooperative in perus alto huayabamba region good credentials to be sure but how does the end product measure upthe taste description on the wrapper says delicious and full bodied with fruity red berry notes and thats fairly accurate the chocolate melts quite quickly and those tangy mildly acidic fruit notes are there almost immediately backed up with a darker richer set of flavours that creep in slowlyits also rather moreish especially mid afternoon with a cup of coffee that mouthwatering acidity coupled with the light fruitiness of the cacao means its far too easy to keep munching chunk after chunk definitely one of my better supermarket picks and one id recommend if you happen across itsounds like a good one  impressive that theyve got the carbon neutral thing going as well as fair trade and that it tastes good do they do a darker chocolate version as well
but the underside is just as interesting tooits almost a shame to eat it almostthe flavour of the chocolate surprised me even with the instant heat of the paprika it came through wonderfully its sweet and fruity and really quite delicious the paprika gives it a nice kick but its not overpoweringly strong and doesnt linger after the chocolate has melted that little kick combined with the warm and fruity chocolate notes is enough to keep you coming back for more and moreim less convinced by the almonds though im not a big fan of nuts and chocolate especially whole ones and although these do give an interesting look to the bar im not sure they add much to the flavour sure they add a bit of extra texture but i think i would have preferred the chocolate without them that said this is still a delicious single origin chocolate bar and im glad to have found it in my stash before it expired i dont know that this bar is easy to get hold of outside of hungary but ill certainly be looking out for more from sznt tiborcomments are closed
all three use local raw honey as the sweetener in addition to the cacao and vanilla in the sweet rose a  chocolate there is also rose essential oil likewise the cool mint contains peppermint oil though already small bars they are divided into six squares each even the sweet rose is rather dark in color the shine and luster of all three is fitting enough for even nonraw chocolate as is the deep vibrancy with which the chocolate snaps what the rawness does mean is that quickly after the chocolate begins melting in your mouth you notice a slightly dusty consistency and even what are like an addition of miniscule nibs the overall feel is smooth enough but just be aware of this extra elementalmost more than adding a flavor the rose oil adds tone to the chocolate softening and sweetening it im not thrilled though by the lingering mouthfeel it leaves your mouth drier than other chocolates do and almost crosses into bitter territorywith the honey dark and the cool mint bars the cacao percentage moves up to  it was on examining the honey dark that i noticed something curious when you hold the chocolate at an angle the edges where it was broken become home to a silver mine tiny clear white crystals catch the light according to what eyecatching scientific composition i know notstrangely i find that the honey dark feels sweeter than the sweet rose mainly because i can taste the honey in it the chocolate is darker yes but in the sense of being deeper not more bitter being able to taste the honey lightens the mood and seriousness if only the final mouthfeel were less harshi must share my first introduction to the cool mint which occurred when i was opening the mailbox containing the zorbas package i didnt know what was inside the package but i kid you not i smelled mint when i opened the mailbox the unwrapped bar itself could possibly act as an air freshener it comes with an instant clean mint feel in the mouth without the bite mint toothpaste and mouthwash have its cool enough to feel like ice cream giving the illusion of softer texture as in a truffle perhaps to the chocolate the degree of minty strength this bar hits without being overbearing is amazing i must thus name it one of if not the best mint chocolates ive had i even forget its rawif you only want to try one of these three bars go for the mint if youre looking for a new raw chocolate company zorbas chocolate is smooth and flavorful so long as the nibbiness doesnt bother youcomments are closed
inside the same simple and stylish packaging is another selection of eight different chocolatesi continue to be surprised and delighted by matcha chocolat i have to confess i was a little worried when katie moved away from purely tea inspired chocolates but in actual fact that move has enabled her to really show off her skill some of the flavour combinations are remarkable and each chocolate is perfectly made and beautifully presentedany mum would be lucky to get these on mothers day but do yourself a favour and by a box for yourself too  dont make your mum share theseweve all had that awkward moment when you take someone a gift of a box of chocs when you visit them  and they get you a drink and you stay a while but they dont open the chocolates to share or not to share 
i hadnt really planned on picking out two bars that featured ginger but i suppose that particular root attracts me subliminally because im a fan anyway there were enough other bits and pieces thrown into each bar so i wasnt anticipating that id get them confused and then i noted they both had dried fruit in them too and thats when i realised that i really should pay more attention when im buying chocolate because these were a lot more similar than i thought so its time for a compare and contrast reviewfirst up is the sakura bar which is  chocolate with sundried cherries and candied ginger unwrapping the bar releases a big waft of ginger suggesting that i was in for a treat it doesnt quite get there though the ginger is pleasant enough but there isnt enough of it to make this a bar for real ginger lovers the cherries dont really enter into the equation until the very end when they are the chewy residue left behind after all the chocolate has gone away ot really what i was expecting but even i still actually enjoyed itthe heart of gold bar brings together a more robust  chocolate with cranberries blueberries matcha cinnamon and ginger  lots of potentially big flavours jostling for position and obviously there are going to be both winners and losers first past the post is the matcha which really dominates although the cinnamon and ginger are both lurking around in the background but again the fruit doesnt really contribute a whole lot until everything else has disappeared and even then the cranberries make more of an impact reaffirming my long held belief that blueberries just dont work well with very dark chocolate not my cup of tea but if matcha tea is your cup of tea then you will probably like this and ive still only made it through  of organicfairs chocolate bar range but im pretty sure there isnt any other ginger and fruit options left although i could be wrong i really should start reading those labelscomments are closed
chocolates may have been more risky to transport nearly coasttocoast but im glad of the opportunity they bring since ive only had michel cluizel bars in the past the tiny fourpiece box the chocolates came in is beautiful its rich brown top receives accents from a bright yelloworange bottom portion and a matching sunny bow the bow looked so pretty and everything was so perfect that i hated to disturb it i just wanted to hold the palmsized box in the center of my hand and smile at itthe sight inside was no less perfect to my eyes so it was at this point that i started to get worried when i review something under a name i esteem i worry that ill too easily think too highly of it yet i also want to be sure im not trying to hold it to too high a standard i tried to keep my mind in the right focus as i approached these chocolates my friend remembered to scribble down the names and i believe i identified them all correctlymaybe its just as well i dont live in new york a box of these a week would be luxury and a box of twelve would be sin dangling just within my reachthanks for describing them so beautifully  i could almost taste them from here now i want to travel more too
once you undo the ribbons and remove the egg from its sturdy box it still looks just as good the simple dark chocolate shell is extremely glossy well tempered and half decorated with sugar flowers and ducklingsonly the frontfacing half of the egg is decorates which is fair enough as packaging intricately decorated eggs can often be a problem these eggs are designed so that they can sent through the post when ordered online and mine arrived in perfect condition and i think id rather sacrifice a bit of extra decoration in return for my egg arriving in one piecethe shell itself is nice and thick but i have to say the contents are a little disappointing a small bag of chocolate characters made from exactly the same chocolate as the egg itself so theres no contrasting flavours or colours and nothing to add a little sweetness to the eggat  for a g egg this is certainly not cheap obviously a lot of work goes into hand decorating and packaging an egg like this but im not convinced a real dark chocolate enthusiast who might receive this as a gift will truly appreciate it and theres nothing to satisfy those with a sweeter tooth eitherultimately its beautiful to look at but the bulk of my egg ended up being broken up and going into my leftover chocolate for cooking jar but perhaps this egg was just not for me  there are plenty of other beautiful creations to choose from on fortnums websiteare you sure this dark egg is disapointing if so should you give yourself a mars egg over this anydaythose bunnies with loads on their backs look like theyre carrying out slave labour
of course bwah hah hah i was keeping something back at the time we didnt just come away with those previous three oh no i came away with more than that in fact i came away with enough chocolate that the only way to get it safely back home in an aircraft was to go and buy another cabin bag to keep it protected a few dollars worth of chocolate two hundred dollars worth of luggage to carry it home in such are the lengths we must go to for you the readerschilli barkthe label says this is layers of dark chocolate with fresh chillies and cinnamonnow i have a confession im not very partial to chocolate with chilli in yes i know its supposed to be how the mayans or aztecs or some lot would slurp down their watery gooey chocolatey drink thingy zinged up with chillies most of the chilli chocolate ive tasted seems to be trying too hard the chilli is there to give heat instead of subtly enhancing the flavour and this detractsi therefore approached caseys chilli bark with some trepidationoh how wrong could i bethis is brilliant masterful wonderful just insanely deliciousthe chocolate starts with a big rich chocolate aroma which develops in the mouth to a rich soft dark slightly earthy chocolate flavour then from stage left the dancing girls come in the cinnamon arrives and builds but where you might ask is the evil villain the chilli surely there must be some the label says so and eventually he pops his head out twirls his evil moustache grins his evil grin and gives a gentle kick in the chops yep mr chilli is there but he delays his appearance and when he appears hes subtle a sheep in wolfs clothing he gives the chocolate and the cinnamon their chance to sing and make merry  and by check they doif i seem to be waxing lyrical as well as mixing my metaphors i am this is exciting brilliant stuff a fantastic mix of flavours well executed and simply divine a chilli chocolate i could eat all day fantasticguinea figsthe willabrand figlettes that i refer to above enrobed using the same kind of process used for making scorched almonds chocolate sultanas and so on that is they are tumbled with chocolate in warm air and then glazed this gives a nice even shiny coating which presents just like many other chocolate coated fruits or nutsdelicaseys guinea figs on the other hand are dipped or drizzled with chocolate the figs are even smaller too each coated fig makes a single mouthful of yumminess the fig is delicate in flavour and still very soft slightly chewy and just well delicioustasmanian mountain berrythe tasmanian pepperberry actually has a wider reach than just tasmania also being found through parts of new south wales and victoriafrom this chocolate its hard to pick an actual flavour  because whilst peppery it has been combined into a sweet slightly sticky caramel the eating turns into a moving feast of flavours  from the chocolate the caramel  and something else a flavour which lingers on slightly peppery slightly fruity the flavour makes me think green ive no idea why long after the chocolate is gone the flavour is subtle and lingering an excellent argument for eating your chocolate slowly this is one to go for if looking for something a little unusual this does not mean it is challenging just a little out of the ordinary one of those to pick up when you get together with friends and want to give them something they are not likely to have come across beforeso now i have to go to australia to try that chilli bark chocolate any chance of you featuring some of our south african artisan chocolate so ive got a hope of finding it or do you need a south african reviewer in situ im interestedwow  really so glad you liked itthose first two sound like something i would adore i wish i could get them
it was very nice but being an experimental type i decided to try it with the wasabi peas that also happened to be on the table everyone pulled faces and told me how disgusting i was until they tried it themselves the creamy chocolate worked perfectly with the heat of the wasabi and the crunch of the pea i had invented something newdarren credits his father with coming up with these i think his father probably stole my thoughts before id had them although a bit of googling reveals the idea has been around for a while the important thing is that somebody is actually making the product i dreamed of shiny little balls of spicy vegetable goodnessand they taste as good as i expected them to of course these arent fine chocolates theyre a snack they may be a couple more ingredients in there than are absolutely necessary theres some added colouring and the chocolate is coated in confectioners glaze but frankly i dont care theyre crunchy spicy and addictivethey taste and texture is a little like a malteser with an initial crunch followed by a bit of spice and a hint of pea part of me feels a little queasy when that pea flavour comes through the milk chocolate but then i find myself eating another and another  im having a kind of lovehate relationship with thembah i was going to fund them but they only ship to the us i shall wait until launch looking forward to springing these on unsuspecting chocolate addictsif you look at the kickstarter page theyll ship internationally if you pledge a few dollars more id just mail them and ask wow this looks like a great chocolate pairing something worth trying at least once you never know until you try iti have tasted these they are amazing  that is the reason i have made a contribution to help darren and his project  his passion is amazing and based on that i have donated some money  getting the product is an added bonus for me  when i went onto the update i saw the tv interview and his smiling face   go get em darrenheh i didnt turn my nose up even before i tasted them though ill grant you that the others did i like weird combinations and wasabi nuts and chocolate always struck me as a good idea good to see someone has done this though should have been chocablog brand pi just finished eating all the ones you gave me waaay too addictive i likei am truly a chocoholic and enjoyed eating them myself and sharing with friends  over the years i have acquired a taste for hot and spicy food  definitely could be a giftable item for holiday or to use as house gift when going to friends house for dinner be positivei know youll get there
whilst better known for their stunning chocolate bars i was fairly confident that their boxes would be more than adequate and once i realised i had some truffles i began to check out the box for more informationit turns out that they dont scrimp on the chocolate even though they probably could have  the milk chocolate is a perfectly acceptable  while the dark chocolate is a robust  and rather surprisingly the white chocolate which is listed as white milk chocolate has a decent  cocoa solids heres the rundown of the contentsa very satisfying collection even if it was a little heavy on the hazelnutalcohol theme the one problem with the box is that these are tiny little truffles  the  in the box weigh in g making it very easy to get through  very quickly and i did and at the end i was genuinely sad that they were all gone because i thoroughly enjoyed themim hoping for another amedei sighting again very soonamedei is one of italys youngest but best brands love their specialty dark chocolates and ive always wanted to visit more of canada than just friends in ottawa so now i can add the relief that good italian chocolate can be found there
recently another box of six arrived and i was curious to see how they compared being february there is a love theme to these chocolates but theyre not specifically valentines chocs so i dont feel too bad that i didnt get around to reviewing them until after valentines daythe chocolates in this limited edition collection arestawberry  champagne trufflethis white chocolate is decorated with a huge slab of freeze dried strawberry which really didnt work for me freeze dried fruit is great in small doses but bigger pieces become a little like cardboard when you eat them aside from that the chocolate itself is very pleasant not too sweet with a gentle hint of champagne id much rather see it with smaller pieces of strawberry thoughhoney ganachethis chocolate is apparently decorated with bee pollen nice except i hate the flavour of honey with a passion and although its relatively subtle here this definitely wasnt for mealmond  vanilla ganachea dark chocolate with a thick shell with a white chocolate ganache filling decorated with flaked almonds the shell on this chocolate was a little thick making it quite difficult to bite through the white chocolate filling is pleasant but the dark chocolate has no particular flavour of its own needs better quality chocolate andor a thinner shellred rosea dark chocolate with rose ganache decorated with raspberry powder i like this one  raspberry and rose go together well but the shell is still too thick fig  ginger trufflea dark chocolate with what appears to be whole pieces of fig and crystalised ginger in the centre the flavours are interesting but there are tiny crunchy pieces inside that make it feel a little like youre chewing sand which is a real shamepassion ganachea dark chocolate with a white chocolate ganache that apparently contains hibiscus citrus rose hips mango and passion fruit theres a little too much going on to pick out individual flavours but its pleasant enoughlast time i reviewed sunshine  butterflies i made the comment that the chocolates were a little rough around the edges  i was hoping that attention to detail would improve with time but if anything these are a little rougher having said that if youre looking for a gift that says home made these arent too bad but with the market for quality chocolate exploding at the moment im afraid these arent something i would buy myselfcomments are closed
his chocolates look as good as they taste so for this particular review im going to keep the words to a minimum and concentrate on showing you the picturesfirst up this selection box featuring  chocolates its a great looking box with a nice magnetic catch to keep the chocolates inside safe with a minimum of fussas you can see theres a good mix of chocolates inside some of the flavour highlights are raspberry orange  clove ginger garden mint marzipan lemongrass and lime and espresso the flavours are varied and some work better for me than others the raspberry truffle has a hint of black pepper for a little heat at the end which was quite nice im personally less keen on spices like clove in my chocolate as i think it can be a little overpoweringthe garden mint was a strange one having the exact same flavour as wrigleys spearmint gum when i first tried this chocolate it was quite cold having just been delivered and the texture of the truffle inside was quite firm adding to this rather odd effectmy favourite of this box though was the chocolate covered dark velvet truffle made with  so tom chocolate which neatly brings me to the second box i received milk chocolate velvet truffles dusted in cocoa rather than being enrobed in chocolate sounds simple but theyre extraordinarily goodwith a perfect cuboid shape and a box designed to fit  chocolates without any extra packaging they certainly look distinctive and they look even more distinctive individuallythey taste amazing they are the smoothest meltiest most wonderful plain chocolate truffles i know theres only one way to eat them just let one of the cubes sit on your tongue and let it melt slowly first the cocoa powder releases its intense chocolate flavour then as it melts the flavour becomes smooth sweet and buttery  but none of that chocolatiness fades theyre simply divineso while the selection box is good these simple unflavoured truffles are to die for theyre sold primarily as wedding favours but i recommend buying them in bulk then just keeping them to yourself these arent for sharingthey sound kind of like an upscale meltykiss  im wondering but sort of doubt if there are additional oils added to the trufflesspoke too soon after reading a bit more on the site it appears these guys are all chocolate
while i love collecting boxes i dont usually get many tins from chocolate  its usually mints that come in tins however i took a closer look at this yellowtoned tin just in case and lo and behold the label told me there were in fact milk chocolate leaves inside a pretty tin chocolate and something related to trees means three of my favorite things all coming togetherafter admiring the tin and imagining what the chocolate leaves must look like i was a little disappointed by the reality of their appearance while i had pictured oval leaves these are more circlelike and the veins have a disappointing impersonal look however they are a nice shape and size roughly around that of a medium to large coin to eat plus the small leaves are all too easy to keep on eating one by onewere you able to find this in the us it didnt sound like it would be worth shipping over from the uka bit cost prohibitivei found this one at world market
as you can see what you get is a reddybrown looking popcorn with dark chocolate drizzled over it the coating is of course sweetened so the first taste is a kind of slightly sticky sweet coating which them warms up as the smoked paprika and ancho chilli kicks in anchos are known for having a sweetness and not too much heat so theyre a good choice for something like thistheres not much information about the chocolate other than it being belgian and dark but it makes up  of the overall weight of this product so theres a fair amount of it around it does add a certain sweetness to the finish and blends in well with the gentle fieriness of the chilli and paprika tasting this is a bit of an adventure first the initial sweetness which is very quickly joined by the subtle smoky heat of the paprika reinforced by the chilli and then mellowed out by the chocolate all in popcorn formthanks for the testi think i have to agree with pappito i am all for chilli chocolate but popcorn plus chocolate chilli and paprika is definitely a combination i would never have thought of maybe thats the appeal although i wouldnt fancy tucking into a pack as i sit down to watch a film i fear id be running to the kitchen for a glass of milk every  mins
at first i was intrigued by the box it features a typically stylish hotel chocolat design but the cellophane wrapping is actually underneath the lid rather than around the whole box but the reason became clear when i removed the lid  the box also contains a little valentines card that you can include when giving it as a gift and this way you can write on the card without ever having to unseal the box its clever little ideas like that that keep hotel chocolat ahead of the competition in terms of designinside you get twelve chocolate hearts with two each perfect for sharing of six flavours including two dark and four milk chocolates each flavour is decorated with a different coloured pattern to distinguish it and while not the most expensive packaging in the world the overall effect is very pleasingthe flavours are strawberry  black pepper raspberry rapture smooth praline soft chilli caramel vanilla truffle and chocolate browniethe vanilla truffle i tried first was sweet with a soft and creamy filling too sweet for me but i was pleasantly surprised by the texture the strawberry and pepper was equally soft almost liquid with a tangy fruitiness followed immediately by the flavour of black pepper although there wasnt much in the way of heatthe chocolate brownie flavour is interesting although i didnt pick up much brownieness myself and found it more like a sweet slightly crunchy praline the soft chilli caramels are the most liquid of the lot with a sweet buttery flavour followed by a fairly significant chilli kick at first the sweetness and heat were a little too much for me but i must have liked it as i found myself eating the other one straight afterthe smooth praline is exactly that a simple hazelnut praline in milk chocolate sweet smooth and nuttyfinally we have the raspberry rapture is a milk chocolate with an ultra smooth tangy raspberry truffle filling i love most fruit chocolates particularly raspberry so this would have to be my favourite of the bunchwith a four month shelf life they cant really compare to the ultra fresh chocolates you would find at your local artisan chocolatier but for those of us who dont have access to such things  or simply cant afford them  these are a great alternativei so want your job tasting and reviewing chocolates im enjoying reading and tasting in virtual mode though hope you dont mind me sharing a link to your review on my blog
the heart is decorated with white chocolate sploges and dark chocolate piping and as you can see the decoration is deliberately haphazard with large areas of freeze dried raspberry showing through the chocolate in places like most of chococos products the chocolate is sourced from the berethical grenada chocolate company if your sweetheart is into ethical and sustainable food production or simply supporting a small british chocolatier then its definitely worth considering this as a valentines giftits a healthy  cocoa solids and its pretty tasty so while i cant guarantee that eating a g milk chocolate heart will be good for you it will certainly make you feel goodthe raspberry and meringue give a lovely biscuity crunchy texture to the chocolate and the random distribution of flavours means that every mouthful is slightly different its very difficult to put down once you start eating itoh this looks deliciousim sorry my friend had an accident when we were kids so yeahthanks for featuring chococo  turned out to be the perfect source of a birthday present to have sent to my mum in somerset  im hoping shell love them as much as i would if i lived in the uk still and could get my hands on them
ill say it straight out this is the prettiest chocolate box ive ever received by farits also the first time ive ever been sent chocolates in a solid mahogany box finished with a gold heart and a brass clasp and wrapped in a beautiful cloth bag i dont think you could hope to find a better example of stylish packagingthe chocolates are handmade in aixenprovence in france by chocolatier pascal caffet and shipped worldwide by dhl mine arrived promptly and in perfect conditionim not going to go into lengthy description of the individual chocolates as frankly theres too many included with the box is what amounts to a small glossy paperback book with photos and descriptions of each of the chocolates in english french and spanish along with a short biography of pascaltheyre made from  venezuelan dark and  ivory coast milk chocolate and helpfully the signature truffles which all look the same have numbers on them so you can easily tell whats what as youd expect with french chocolates theres lots of pralines and nuts along with some ganaches and a carameltheres no really unusual or challenging flavour combinations but each chocolate is very well made and very tastyso youve decided this would make an excellent valentines gift and youd like to know how much they cost right well this box of  chocolates will set you back a cool  that makes them one of the most expensive boxes of chocolates ive ever had if you go for all the optional packaging and delivery extras you can expect to pay closer to  the box looks nice  but overall the price sounds quite dear i do love wooden boxes i have a collection of small ones  and also ive still got some wooden cases that bottles of wine came in and theyre not half as lovely as this boxlike you i was recently treated to a box of zchocolates i agree it is definitely the most elegant box of chocolates i have ever received and the chocolates were indeed very good i was however disappointed that there wasnt a more exciting range of flavours my box contained the full z collection ranging from z to  too many of them were similar and i longed for something that would really knock my socks off i didnt get it but indeed i am left with a beautiful personalized box that i will cherish foreveri think the trick is to get someone else to buy them for you i have to agree i think  is a bit steep for some valentines chocolates sadly i dont think my other half would be stretching to that for me they do look fabulous thoughi discovered their site recently too and was wishing that a box would wing its way to me so i could try them  very envious its very expensive but would make a huge impression as a gift if money were no objectyou guys are lucky to talk about the taste of the chocolates which you have been delivered i have ordered two boxes and i couldnt receive them in three weeks time its really frustrating i feel like i have ordered regret and anger on my own money  that is what i told to my fb friends what a pityive never seen such beautifully presented chocolates  wowhorrible service i ordered a mothers day gift for my mom since i couldnt make it home it was supposed to be delivered the thursday before mothers day i just got off the phone with the shipping company and yeah they now show delivery on wednesday after mothers day what the heck thanks a lot for nothing i paid extra for express delivery even with summer packaging the chocolate will be crap after sitting in shipping for a freaking week im posting fraud on my order through my credit card i will never use zchocolat againi feel like stacey and mulugeta above  i tried sending a box of their chocolates as a christmas present to a friend in mexico and it never arrived  i only chose them because they had a webpage guaranteeing delivery in guadalajara within three days  their guarantee meant absolutely nothing and they had the nerve to tell me they dont make guarantees even though its still there on their site  two days after christmas they told me she needed an import license to receive it  they offered me a free concierge call to let her know that she wouldnt be receiving her gift how nice of them an awful experiencegreat chocolatetop quality but never order it for a special occasion because never arrives on time
as with those the chocolate here is of a refreshing degree of quality its deep rich and earthy aroma expresses itself right away the bar is layered in a way not so unlike a snickers bar with a fluffy white nougat on the bottom then walnuts and then a fig ganache inside the nougat is the interesting ingredient  bayley hazen blue cheese apart from the layering all of these add up to something very different indeed from both a candy and an average chocolate the taste from the cheese isnt strong but it is noticeable taken from fig preserves the fig is also not the most frequently found flavor in chocolate enter the gourmet sceneimagine a fruit and cheese plate with a creamy dip a few walnuts and some thin slices of chocolate or fudge place all of those individual effects together into one  oz chocolate bar and you have the figgy blue it isnt a bar to be eaten quickly but one to take in slowly in order to give time and attention to the four elements it took me a moment to get used to this bar however it has proved itself to me with the fresh tasteful ingredients that i now associate with hs chocolate this one also shows that hs chocolate is capable of doing more than just ordinary confections maintaining a creativity that keeps the products exciting while still familiarits remarkable for me to have a site which is valuable in favor of my experience thanks admin
the flapjacks are simply made from oats sugar syrup and butter and are half dipped actually more like three quarters dipped in dark chocolate of unspecified cocoa percentage or originleaving aside the fact that i dont generally like eating chocolate when i have no idea where its come from i do quite like the design the one corner free from chocolate means you can easily hold it without getting melted chocolate all over your fingerthe texture is a little hard and they are very sweet but i happily made my way through the whole box over the course of a few daysthe florentines are equally sweet made from discs of dark chocolate covered with almonds sugar syrup ginger sultanas and mixed peel they do have a very nice flavour first a hint of orange then the warmth of the ginger theyre chewy and quite moreish that said im just not a big fan of this kind of thing  i usually prefer my chocolate to be in bars truffles or even cakes rather than biscuit form the packaging just doesnt quite do it for me either while id be quite happy with savoury biscuits packaged in thin cardboard boxes with plastic inserts it doesnt scream high end chocolatebut at just  and  a box theyre not expensive so probably worth trying if youre looking for a change from your regular chocolate biscuiti agree with you generally  keeping my flapjacks separate from my chocolate but these do look good as long as that chocolate is the good stuffmmmm yummy  
the day after they were sent they arrived in perfect condition at my door and i wasnt disappointed the box follows the same format as previous matcha selection boxes although this time the box of  contains two of eight different chocolates  in other words its a great box for sharing with your partnerthe chocolates arethere are some amazing flavour combinations in this stunning box of chocolates that look every bit as good as they taste matchas katie christoffers makes all her chocolates from her tiny kitchen by hand yet somehow manages to produce a world class product in my opinion shes one of the most talented chocolatiers in the uk and fully deserves the recognition of the awards she has receivedwow those look fantastic cardamom mmmm good chocolate has to be one of the best valentines gifts as far as im concerned are these available anywhere else in the world cant wait till i get back to the uk again one daynow im in love and im trying to keep my weight down but still id better make sure my other half sees this page
i cant say that theyve ever really been my thing but they offered to send us some special personalised mms to try and who am i to refuse such a generous offeryou can add two lines of text to personalise your mms and the text gets printed on to the actual shell unfortunately theres no choice of flavours yet  all the different colours are the same milk chocolate mms underneath i know several people who have a thing for some of the more interesting mm flavours like peanut butter or pretzel who may be a little disappointed by that for most people though i think just the fact that they can have mms with their name on will be enoughif youve ever had mms before youll know what they taste like theyre sweet and creamy with a crispy shell too sweet for some and the chocolate does contain added vegetable fats in addition to cocoa butter but the kind of thing that once you start eating its difficult to stop a significant portion of my box is already gone i think  i might sprinkle the rest on ice cream to serve to friends for an awesome branded dessertdespite me not really being an mm person there is something quite cool about having your message written on chocolate whether its an expression of love or your company name i want more in different colours i wouldnt eat them of course  id just decorate my home with themthese are really cool ive heard alot about getting personalized mms but never seen how they actually look thanks for posting the pic now i want some too mms chocolate have vegetable fat in them in the uk what are the ingredients for your version in the us they dont have vegetable fat but a sizeable amount of dairy fats i thinkcute wooooooooooooowothis is fantastic  i have just come across this post and taken a look at the m  m website you can even have a photo printed onto them i am now thinking of ways presents that i can use them  thanks for the blogthe concordia lutheran church mens club will once again be selling christmas trees and wrathes this year the tree lot is located at the churchschool  lake avenue   christmas tree sales will begin on friday november rd   the lot will be open  am to  pm daily except saturday mornings when it opens at  am    the proceeds from this fund raiser are used to support various projects and functions of the concordia church and school   a selection can be made from scotch pine white pine douglas fir fraser fir and blue spruce  these trees were just cut a couple of weeks ago please come see how fresh they are decorated and undecorated wrathes are also available  your patronage would be greatly appreciated
perhaps unsurprisingly that original wasnt around for very long and now nestl have come up with a new range of chunky kitkats  orange double choc white and peanut butter is back in a new formso lets start with the peanut butter version its a similar format with a thick layer of peanut butter on top of the wafer and generally seems to be an improvement on the original its very very sweet but it does at least taste of peanut butterthe orange version has a slightly different format with more wafer and an orange flavour cream between the wafer layers its not quite as sweet and although the orange flavour doesnt taste much like real oranges i preferred it to the peanut butter versionthe double choc kitkat is similar to the peanut butter version with the layer of peanut butter replaced with what the wrapper calls a chocolate flavour topping i always try to avoid anything that calls itself chocolate flavour as generally means not chocolate at all to me at tastes mainly of sugar and milk powderfinally we have the white chocolate kitkat this really is mainly sugar and milk powder and its way too sweet for me i managed a couple of bites but this one definitely isnt for me hardcore sugar addicts may like it but theres no actual chocolate flavouri agree the basic problem with them is their size and you cant just break off a small amount like the four fingered two fingered varieties if cadburys brought out smaller versions id definately buy as the big ones are far too sweet to eat at once or just take a bite ofi didnt really like them either check it out httpwwwgobblemonkeycomkitkatchunkychampionhtmlbring out a twix chunkyomg kitkat peanut butter i wantcan i just say that i adore kit kat chunkys and ive just that minute had the new version hazelnut cream it was amamzingm but my all time favourite is peanut butter by far i havent been able to find one in so long i hope they still do thembad news dom peanut butter won oh well i tried a kitkat chunky caramel today they are tempting and very nice but not as good a crunchies they should make a kitkat chunky with cadbury crunchie honeycombam studying ukg daily i like  have kit kat for intervalthere is a question to the nestl and kitkat brand manager why the kitkat standard bar made in the uk had a better taste than the one made in germany and the bulgarian made one is also different
valentines day is nearly upon us which means vast arrays of pink heart shaped products from all the big chocolate companies divine sent us these white chocolate hearts with strawberry pieces to review but they also do  dark chocolate and milk chocolate heartsthe hearts themselves are simple affairs just a couple of centimetres across and wrapped in silver foilthe hearts themselves are equally simple white chocolate with flecks of pink from the strawberry pieces insidei was expecting the strawberry pieces to be simple freezedried fruit but theyre actually strawberry crisp made with strawberries sugar and starch im sure theres a good reason for this and they do melt in the mouth better than simple pieces of fruit but they do make a sweet chocolate even sweeterbut they are quite tasty and small enough that theyre never too sweet as long as you dont eat the whole box in one go  im not a white chocolate kind of person but still found these very enjoyable that little hint of strawberry flavour makes all the differencedespite the fact that theyre aimed at those with a sweeter tooth than me id still be quite happy to receive them as a gift not that i ever get valentines gifts myselfi thought you werent reviewing divine chocolate anymoreim not a white chocolate fan either i wonder what these would be like in the dark chocolate version
i drink a lot of tea sometimes i think if chocolate and tea were the only two food groups left on earth i would be quite happy in fact my diet would probably be pretty much the same as it is nowopen the box and youre greeted by a satisfying chocolatey aroma there are  tea temples very fancy biodegradable tea bags inside and the instructions say to let it infuse for three minutes then serve with milk or cream so thats what i didi was surprised just how much the finished product looked like my regular cuppa although if im honest i was hoping to find a tiny pig swimming around in it this was not the casenone of the chocolatey aroma from the bags is lost in the finished product and that carries through to the flavour its just like your normal every day tea but with a hint of chocolate that somehow manages not to overwhelm the flavour from the tea itselftea and chocolate may seem like an odd flavour combination but it works very well its not going to give you the same hit as a hot chocolate made from made from  cacao and spices but its perfect for that mid morning cuppa i like it a lot i might even be persuaded to try the rest of the teapigs range if only they could be persuaded to add chocolate to them allabsolutely you cani ordered some of these after reading your review at lunchtime and theyre on the way already so im impressed with their service if nothing else looking forward to trying them
the box contains  of the ballshaped truffles spread over two layers and it states on the box they were imported from england but im really not sure who the maker might be palm oil is listed in the ingredients but to be perfectly honest the chocolate tastes pretty good to me the truffles have a lovely thick shell which means that it takes a little bit of work to get inside and thats a good thing because the dulce de leche in the centre is very very runnythe potential issue with any combination of milk chocolate and dulce de leche is that it can be very sweet but fortunately these stay just on the right side of the line the creamy chocolate and creamy caramel work very well together and theres a real lushness to the truffles that makes them feel more luxurious than youd expect from a supermarket i found myself quickly working my way through half of the top layerand thats how i discovered the real problem with this box  the chocolates are rather one note theres absolutely nothing about them which isnt revealed after the first bite no hidden depths no layers of flavour just chocolate and dulce de leche although it is done very well but after four ive had enough and im going to share the rest of the box something which speaks volumescomments are closed
so what of the chocolate well this particular bar is made from beans from ghana and cuba and comes stamped with the date it was produced and the autograph of the makerpacker the bar has wonderfully vibrant red fruit aromas with a deep woody undertone and these flavours are definitely there in the mouth the forty eight hour conch means that the chocolate still has a slightly grainy texture to it but thats in no way unpleasant  its just not as supersmooth as say a classic swiss chocolate as soon as a piece of this chocolate hits your mouth the acidity has your salival glands off and running this is one of those light fruity acidic type dark chocolates with the red fruit and wood aromas translating into a big mouthful of dark earthy cacao lows with top notes of new wood fruit and an undertone of coffee the first thing i noticed when tasting was the lightness and acidity of the first rush of flavour the cacao flavours are light and quite soft with that fruitiness persisting throughout the mouthfeel remains light throughout and the finish is long and clean making it all to easy to eat another chunk then another    as you might imagine i recommend tracking this down bean to bar chocolate makers are still thin on the ground and naive would appear to be making great progress both with their product and their international presence and thats something that deserves more support if you follow them on facebook im sure youll be kept abreast of when and where theyll be selling in london andor other uk locationshi i actually had a chance to visit them during last christmas and it was a great experience   couple of weeks ago i stumbled upon new tastes they introduced orange milk adding to their to their previous line salted cocoa nibs etc  i cant eat bad chocolate anymore

i have received several items from zorbas starting with this clear bag of spiced chocolate almonds the chocolate ingredient is raw cacao powder accompanied by such things as coconut palm sugar ginger cinnamon vanilla cayenne himalayan sea salt and essential oils of orange since theyre raw the almonds are more chewy than crunchy this suits me just fine as i usually eat almonds raw anywaywhat occurs though when you eat these is the forgetting that youre even eating nutsthere is so much flavor that its almost more like eating a brownie or even a truffle note that the name says spiced not spicy i imagine only those most intolerant to spiciness would call these spicy its the ginger thats fairly strong with the vanilla and orange oil having as much say as the cayenne and cinnamon being accompanied by all this the chocolate tastes rich and not blackdark these are the perfect flavor complements for raw almondsthe coating on the almonds is difficult to properly describe its like chocolate but more crumbly yet it stays in place and doesnt make a mess which is a very nice characteristic although a couple of the almonds are lone most exist in clusters personally i would prefer more individual almonds eating individual pieces is part of the fun of eating nuts yet this is a great product the perfect treat for the healthconscious person as a hiking snack or something to keep in your desk a bag of these almonds will do you and your palate goodcomments are closed
as the weekly meeting rolled around we found that this time we had one with a much higher cocoa percentage something to keep us dark side dwellers happy and orange peel  interesting as i and others have written before  chocolate and orange is a classic combination which can be good  and can be awfulapart from balancing sweetness and bitterness one of the other effects of putting the cocoa at around the  to  range is that the chocolate seems to break more easily and melt away a little faster high cocoa chocolates in theory should be more intense in flavour but they also seem to have a bit more snap and melt away a little slowera few of the group quite liked this without really passing any other more criticial judgement but what struck me was that the flavour of orange was not very strong and the chocolate flavour took a long time to develop this led me to the two ways of eating chocolate crunching it up and gobbling it down like a pig just led to disappointment the chocolate is not very chocolatey and the orange is not very orangey in fact you would struggle to tell there was any orange in it at allletting this slowly melt tells another story the chocolate flavour develops slowly and builds to a pleasant intensity it is not a strong dark chocolate but its not bad during this slow melting there is  a little orange flavour but not a lot once the chocolate has melted the orange pieces then do have an orange flavour and are a pleasant thing to suck on noisily if you can get away with it or just chew upso to really get the enjoyment you need to work at it thats actually a bit disappointing  there are other orange chocolates that are betterthe last words go to one of the tasting group who summarised it thus insufficiently orangeycomments are closed
when people ask what percent chocolate i like best i usually respond with the s though higher cacao percentages can be amazing theyre also more difficult to get right consequently sweetriots  bar was bound to befriend me it gives bitter and dusty hints before mellowing out making it almost like a combination of the previous two bars its entirely like a flourless chocolate cake with its flavorful weightiness at the very last portion the strong chocolate notes really start to get into your bonesthese are quality bars and i appreciate sweetriots ethics the last bar obviously pleased me but i feel like i want something more from the first two dont get me wrong theyre nice its just that the look of sweetriot is bright halfcrazed and shouting with a voice to be heard the  and  dont seem to quite reach that kind of expression when im promised much i want muchcomments are closed
first things first the packaging i really like it a slick black box with an embossed logo that slides open to reveal the gold wrapped bar under a flap of card with a picture of jewelsthe bar inside the wrapper is just as impressive its not the biggest in the world at g but it feels hefty with seven big chunks each embossed with the zokoko logo from the moment you pick up the box to the moment you put the first chunk in your mouth it looks and feels like a quality product it has a glossy appearance and a rich fruity aroma that makes it almost irresistible one thing this has in common with the daintree estates chocolate is the texture plenty of cocoa butter ensures that glossy finish translates to a beautifully smooth mouthfeel the chocolate melts slowly at first taking a moment for the flavours to start to come through when they do though the flavours take you on a wonderful journey with caramel tanin and red fruit notes its no suprise that this chocolate won a bronze medal in last years academy of chocolate awards its quite difficult to put down unfortunately its not very easy to get hold of outside australia yet but if you speak nicely to the zokoko people you might be able to get hold of some its worth it if you canthis chocolate should be compared with felchlin  confissery spruengli cru sauvage and not with bojesen the notion to compare or mention daintree estates is not clear tranquilidad is an estate wild cocoa woodland and daitree is whatdifficult to compare it to something ive never hadi compared it to bojesen simply because its made with bolivian beans and with daintree because theyre another australian beantobar producer simplehi dom understood but if you can compare both with the cru sauvage as this was the first in  ever beantobar chocolate made from bolivian wild beans outside bolivia to your knowledge bojesen is giving the impresion that the cacao from baures is a criollo variety which is not it is an endemic to the benipando region newly rediscovered forastero with very small beanswould love to ty that the packaging is awesome hopefully the chocolate tastes as good as the package seems to be 
this little bar has been in my collection for a while and its a bit battered and very slightly bloomed but that wont stop me eating it so i thought i may as well review it as wellthis bar is packed in the standard amedei way its a simple g bar wrapped in a deceptively large card pouch that might make it look the same size as the   g bars from other manufacturers that youll see alongside it in the shops it looks nice but if you dont know amedei or look at the weight on the back of the pack when you buy it you might not be overly happy when you see the size of the bar insidethis is a  cocoa solids dark chocolate with small pieces of sicilian almond liberally scattered through it those almond pieces add a nice texture to the chocolate as well as a surprising amount of flavour the chocolate though is a touch on the sweet side for my liking and while there is a bit of fruitiness theres not a lot of depth to itits simple sweet and nutty very easy to eat but not the finest of fine chocolates not my favourite amedei offering but its one of those chocolates in my stash that i wish id got around to trying when it was it its best given the size of the bar and how quickly it disappears im going to have to get at least two next time thoughamedeis chocolates are great products they are availabel in our online shop too we are in spain and portugal with the best chocolate amedei domori pralus cluizel weiss zaabar pacari torreblanca erovira obalaguerthis looks really lovely this one i havent tried anything by amedei before but i definitely will now
reading the ingredients list we find that the milk chocolate contains  cacao  a similar level to most of the better supermarket milk chocolates i also noticed that this bar is  sugar  almost half of the recommended daily amount for an adult if you eat the whole bar so its sweet at this point i was thinking well i hope theres plenty of salt in the caramel but unfortunately the caramel to chocolate ratio isnt particularly high so there wasnt much chance of the filling balancing the sweetness of the chocolatefurthermore the caramel itself is the ms version of salted caramel its a safe middle of the road polite sort of salted caramel in other words its a bit of a let down the sweetness of the milk chocolate more or less obliterates what saltiness there is in the caramel filling making the whole thing a bit of a let downits unrealistic to compare something like this with any hand made or small batch salted caramel chocolate but i did expect something a little less safe to my mind the whole point of salted caramel chocolate is to provide those lovely little peaks of flavour from the main ingredients and unfortunately the majority of what i tasted was sugar it is possible to grab a taste of the caramel but its all too brief and the chocolate lacks any real depth or character great review to be honest though the name put me off as soon as i saw the title lol  chocolate should always be sweet too many companies mess around with it xxxhave you ever actually tried salted caramel part of the problem with this is it needs more salt oh btw am following you as xcardiffbirdx sorry to comment twice xxxxoh this sounds such a let down i noticed this in store at christmas and was debating buying some im an s girl so i grew up with every good treat containing salt and have spent the last years complaining how theyve removed it i do like a bit of salt in sweet things the more the better
the large tin looked a lot more impressive before it was open  theres a lot of packaging to house the fifteen or so large pieces inside each piece is very generously coated with pieces of roasted almonds too so generously that the bottom of the tin is absolutely covered with pieces that fell off and youd never know because each bit of toffee is still very generously coated the nuts are there more for texture than anything else and despite the fact that there are lots of them they definitely take a back seat to both the chocolate and its contentsthe chocolate isnt anything to write home about  theres no percentage provided but im assuming that were talking about something in the twenties or thirties any issues with the chocolate however is completely overshadowed by the butter toffee which is really good  nice chunky pieces which are rich and crunchy just the way they should be this isnt a sophisticated butter toffee like those which have been perfected by the likes of poco dolce this is just a big slab of buttery goodness which is rough around the edges and very easy to eati definitely wouldnt complain if someone handed me another tin right now just in case someone was considering itcomments are closed
the packaging and form of the bars follows the standard labooko format two bars in the familiar mould with the majority of ingredients being fair trade organic  or both zotter make a point of emphasising that their soya is organic and gmo free as one might expectso what do they taste like i tried the dark bar first with  cacao unrefined sugar and a little sesame it delivers quite a good cacao hit with an underlying sweetness but it remains a little flat on the palate the lack of milk means that the rich creamy aspects of a high cacao content milk chocolate never really develop the cacao flavours are there but they never really seem to lift off in they way standard chocolate does this is more obvious with the white bar i took a piece of this one immediately after i tasted the dark bar and it was quite hard to think of it as chocolate theres a floral earthy flavour to this bar that i didnt really like much at all as it seemed to sit above any cacao flavours that this bar might have contained it wasnt completely unpleasant but it certainly didnt make me want to go back for a second trythese two bars put me in mind of the ersatz chocolate bars from europe that my polish grandmother would give us in the seventies its trying to be chocolate but doesnt actually get there leaving me feeling slightly disappointed of course i am not lactose intolerant and so have been able to sample all manner of wonderful chocolate creations which knock these bars into any number of cocked hats for all i know zotter could have produced the best milk free chocolate in the world  all i need is a suitably allergic guinea pig to test them out on but the person i had in mind hasnt been available to date i tried these bars out on several people none of whom were allergic to milk and the verdict was universal  dark bar good white bar not so good i think we need opinions from the nonchocolate eating community for the full picture but for the time being id say if you can eat ordinary chocolate youd be wasting your time on thiscomments are closed
first impressions for hs chocolate are good light pastel kinds of colors are set against dark brown in the logo and packaging the paper wrapped around the chocolates is patterned in a way to remind me of scrapbooking the look is oldfashioned but new not old handmade and a touch artsandcrafts all of these observations fit in with the companys aim to blend an oldfashioned sweet shoppe sensibility with the modern and exotic flavor profiles of today they also dont forget about the importance of fresh ingredients local ingredients when possible and small batchesi asked for the peanut butter or fluffernutter chocolate because i have been having such a wonderful exploration of peanut butter type chocolates latelyits a great combination and everyone does it differently ive never seen something quite like the fluffernutter this thing could be a cult classic first its definitely on the big size its around   inches or  centimeters tall and rather wider its composition includes a kind of peanut butter fluff inside of milk chocolate with a few peanuts also added in the consistency of the fluff is perfect sort of like a marshmallows but not so stiff or solid to compare to the reeses filling it has a little less salt and noticeably better ingredients because this is rather big i suppose the peanuts add some solidity to all the fluff the edges of plain chocolate allowed me to get a taste of it aloneall i know is that this is belgian chocolate but it speaks for its quality on its own its rich with caramel notes and is just another reason to love the fluffernutter i exaggerate not i truly love this chocolatethe concept of the gingerbread filled chocolate appealed to me because of the holidays this one isnt so big as the fluffernutter being much flatter and more like a chocolate patty than a cluster molasses ginger cinnamon nutmeg and cloves are all in the ingredients i believe the chocolate here is a little darker likely to match the richness of the spices its a very different experience from the previous chocolate but still a pleasant one there is enough chocolate to still enjoy it and also enough of the gingerbread filling to taste it in each bitecomparing the not inexpensive price tag of  per chocolate to the normal price of  or  for many smaller truffles out there the cost isnt unreasonable these are quality pieces ones i can give the great compliment that they make me happycomments are closed
as you can see from the ingredients list thats pretty much all there is to this bar even with two added flavours theres still just five ingredients listed  thats always a good sign the other interesting thing to note is the use of sunflower lecithin rather than soya lecithin something which means that those with soya allergies can also enjoy itobviously coffee is a much stronger flavour than smoked sea salt and thats apparent from the moment the chocolate hits your tongue theres probably not very much coffee at all in the chocolate but the fact that its made with real ground coffee beans means the flavour bursts through right awayafter the initial burst of flavour the sweetness of the chocolate comes through along with the crunch  of the cocoa nibs it may be hand made beantobar chocolate made with the finest ingredients but its uncomplicated tasty and very easy to eat its one of those chocolate bars i have to hide from myself or ill end up devouring it all within a few minutes its very different from the amazing flavours of duffys award winning honduras indio rojo bar and obviously a coffee flavoured chocolate wont appeal to everyone but i really enjoyed itfor me what makes duffy so great is his completely unpretentious approach to chocolate making hes not one to talk at length about flavour profiles and tasting notes hell just try something and if he likes it hell sell it he makes fine chocolate accessible to everyone simply by using quality ingredients and doing what feels rightcomments are closed
as with many of the japanese kitkats the colour is quite striking the bright green isnt the most appetising colour in the world but by kitkat standards its still quite restrained the flavour is also quite subtle  in fact its difficult to discern much flavour at all at first its not too sweet but theres no real flavour from the chocolatebut right at the end youre greeted by a subtle matcha flavour its a flavour that stays with you long after the kitkat has gone and then just seems to get stronger what starts off as quite a pleasant flavour develops into something that hangs around just a little too long like garlic in fact the only way i found to get rid of the aftertaste was to have another piece of kitkat  clearly part of nestls master plan to make me eat morehaving said that its certainly not the most offensive chocolate ive ever had and although its not something id buy for myself its an interesting introduction to the world of crazy kitkats if youre into that kind of thingmimi gave me one too and i really enjoyed it i dont usually like white chocolate but the matcha flavour whilst subtle made it work i didnt mind the after taste at allgetting my mouth watery running to get the one lolliving in japan i love finding  trying all the different kitkats its like a treasure hunt ive not had the green tea ones yet seen them just have not purchased yetyes i am into this sort of thing  i hope i can find these at my local asian market  i really hope they make taro flavor too where can you buy those kitkat in londonnot sure cybercandy used to sell lots of unusual japanese kitkats but they havent had any the last few times ive been ini discovered green tea kitkats in kyoto several years ago and was instantly infatuated every time anyone i know goes to japan i beg them to bring some back for me there are  versions of these candy bars that i know of one is matcha flavored white chocolate with crispy wafers the other  much harder to find  version has matcha infused white chocolate outside but the wafers are layered with red bean paste inside the red bean and matcha version is the bestthat second one sounds amazingnestl are the ones who should not make kitkats at all in fact they should not make any of the good brands they have aquired andor changed  aero is good thoughnestl doesnt sell those kitkats in the states or europe because they contain traces of fish
the eldest son had his th birthday party a while ago this meant that the lady of the house and i had to make ourselves scarce  apart from when it came time to do a pizza run a trip to the pizza shop saw me requesting t other half do a quick detour to pick up any chocolate that was going cheap as you do one of the things she came back with was this lindt passion fruit  proudly emblazoned with newrather than rush gobble it down i waited until a suitable family gathering where we could all eat ourselves silly in the warm australian spring sunshine drink too much good wine and scoff a bit of chocolate part of the reason for waiting was to get a few other opinions because passion fruit in chocolate it seems a bit of a strange combination and i was very unsure about this onepassion fruit are one of those odd things here where if you live in the right place they grow very well  until the plant gets a virus whereupon it promptly drops dead and of course all later attempts to replicate the success fail miserably when i was child we had a passion fruit vine which was prolific during summers my parents would go out each day and shake it then collect a plastic bucket full of passion fruit off the ground  i think there are still some old photos of my younger sister aged about  with a plate covered in  shells a happy smile on her face and a teaspoon  having polished off most of the daily bucketfull by herselfanyhow  i digress the ingredients list on this pack shows several interesting things firstly this one is actually made at kilchberg in switzerland most lindt in australia is made in france and secondly the passion fruit preparation is only  of the contents and of that passionfruit makes up  so the actual passionfruit amount is pretty small  under  so it should not have a lot of flavour impact right errr wrongfrom having my doubts and it is still a bit unusual this is an intensely passionfruity chocolate opening the pack lets the smell drift out and unlike some things where the flavour takes a while to develop this just reaches out and smacks you in the mouth whack whack take that for flavour it really is quite incredible perhaps my only remaining reservation is that the flavour is so intense that you really dont want to eat a vast amount in a single sitting but that makes more for a bit later on which has to be a good thingnow this is new ive seen similar excellence bars with cranberry or blueberry but never this onei remember that about seven yeas ago lindt had a summer desserts box and one of the chocolates in there was made with passion fruit and as far as i remember that was one delicious box of fruity chocolates   also mild dark between  and  cocoa also containing almond slithers
i was hoping that the sour cherry would be suitably tart and i wasnt disappointed the fruity acidity makes the mouth water and as the sharp sweetness cuts into the dark cocoa the light chocolate mousse joins in with the chilli adding a hint of warmth to the finish in fact my only crticism would be that the hint of warmth is just that a hint personally i could have taken a little more heat but i suppose this bar is designed to have mass appeal and too much chilli might well scare many people offother than a lack of kick i have to say i was rather impressed with this when you consider that youre getting just shy of g g if you must know of well made well presented chocolate with an unusual and well put together filling for not much more than youd pay for a standard bar of cadburys theres s very strong argument for checking out your local aldi this is another highend supermarket product at a very competitive pricefound this some time ago but its not always available gorgeous stuffi quite liked it the chocolate itself was good but found it too sweetwas bought some of this as a christmas present after finishing it i craved it so much i made a special trip to aldi to purchase  more bars i had to dig deep in the boxes though as it was in scare supply hidden behind some other mousse au chocolat  bars quite possibly the best value chocolate i have ever tastedi absolutly love these i buy it every week from aldi a good tip put it in the freezer for a few hours then eat it it makes  times betterglamorous amazing epic
no worries though the crystal salt bar has as much salt as anyone could ask for now i do love saltim not above sprinkling some on my hand when i want a salt kick but i got a little frightened when i unwrapped this bar and found a heavy sprinkling of himalayan salt on both sides just looking at it is enough to make your mouth pucker it really is great salt thoughim tempted to just lick it all off the chocolate the thing is it falls off fairly easily so the chocolate may have slightly less salt when it reaches your mouth also the chocolate is potent and deep giving an intense cacao hit put that together with the salt hit and this is one dense little bar one or two squares is plenty for me giving this some further thought i think i would prefer if the salt was spread inside the chocolate rather than outside as it is all those crystals attack your tongue first thing and are already disappearing by the time you really get into the chocolate maybe i would feel better about a more even combinationthe chocolate though raw it isnt heated above  degrees fahrenheit isnt wholly foreign i mentioned it being rougher which it is but it has its own kind of smoothness i find myself more likely to chew the chocolate at least a littleit doesnt melt in quite the usual way but its just different its still entirely approachablethe buddha cup pleases me and even the crystal salt bar grows more endearing the more i nibble from it these two succeed as bold flavored raw chocolates they deliver the necessaries of pure ingredients if its the healthy side youre interested in otherwise the rich and even explosive flavors ought to be enough to interest you
obviously i had to what was inside that innocent looking box first i wasted no time in ripping it open and what i found inside was not innocent at allthis is a cherry chocolate and rum cake  covered in chocolate icing and topped with gold leaf at least thats the official description i would describe it as a rum rum chocolate rum gold and rum cake because this is truly the most alcoholic cake ive ever tasted to say the texture is moist would be an understatement its positively damp theres so much rum in it that even after just one slice i was feeling a little tipsy that made it quite difficult to review  but i managed to press on consuming another three slices before concluding that i like it but i do think i would have liked it even more had their been a touch less alcohol and a touch more chocolatefinally we have the gingerbread reindeer  for a bag of two id love to tell you more about them but as they dont contain any chocolate legally im not allowed to say much but they are crunchy chewy gingery and deliciouscomments are closed
this chocolate is widely sold i have seen it for sale in australian specialty shops but have never bought anythis chocolate is a bit strange firstly the cranberries are large and have a strange full feel to them maybe thats how they go when preserved or treated or whatever is done to get a decent shelf life they remind me of glac fruit they dont really taste of anything much thoughthe other thing about this is that ignoring the berries the chocolate is very light  it is only  cocoa solids so the dark chocolate haters might like it but it does not have a lot of chocolately flavour it is very sweet and has a slightly fatty  greasy mouth feel this is not because of the evil palm oil it has none but is more likely to be due to the main ingredient sweetened condensed milk the number  ingredient is cranberries and the number  is cocoa butter this explains the sweetness and the mouth feel  lightening off the fat would be a good thingthe general consensus amongst the meeting participants was that this is pretty ordinary the label calls it premium but none of us could agree with that perhaps most telling was that at the end of an hour long meeting there was some left over its not like this is awful its just not very goodbrusnica actually is not cranberry its a different berry it also grows in russia and has the same name here i do not know the precise name in english but my dictionary says it is cowberry or red huckleberry or red bilberry anyway it looks yummy in a chocolate bar
as you can see the chocolate itself is a kind of oversized dark chocolate shelled truffle with a white chocolate topping and coloured chocolate leaves  berries the shell and base are surprisingly thick and appear to be made from james  dark chocolatethe truffle filling is as close to a christmas pudding in a chocolate as i have eaten dark chocolate mixes with muscovedo sugar dried fruit and citrus peel with a good dollop of brandy thrown into the mix the fruit and spice combination hit your palate immediately and the chocolate truffle has enough body to mean it doesnt get lost in the mix the shell and particularly the base are very thick and te its rich its undoubtedly festive and it did two things it made me smile before i ate it and again when i tasted the truffle this is quite a neat little christmas novelty hand made  reasonably priced i think this is quite a neat little item the flavours are authentic enough for it to do as it promises and the price isnt likely to scare anyone off theyre available to order from james website right nowcomments are closed
i always love it when i discover someone doing something a bit different with chocolate whether its experimenting with unusual flavours or going to great length to source cocoa beans it shows a passion for producing something specialthis little sample box was given to me at the south bank chocolate festival and i was keen to try them in total black river make  different chocolates but i have four to try calvados ganache praline praline with crme brule and praline with hazelnutsall in all a very nice selection of chocolates presented in a nice little box that closes with a magnetic catch its the simple things that please me for my tastes they are slightly too sweet and i wasnt able to pick out flavour notes in the chocolate itself but the average consumer who is used to the likes of hotel chocolat and thorntons isnt going to care too much about that they want well made tasty chocolates and these certainly fit the billi think black river is a great idea and im certain theyll be a success id love to see them experiment and go in other directions beyond these belgian chocolates too perhaps some simple bars that show off the flavour  of the chocolate itself or maybe to work with some british chocolatiers using shorter shelf life ingredients to really enhance the flavour of the jamaican cacaobut whatever direction they decide to go in i think the future is bright for black rivercontains dark chocolate milk chocolate   cocoa solidsdoes that mean the  cocoa for the milk chocolate that would be very nice  there arent many calvados chocolates out there so that piece certainly grabbed my attentionyes it does at some point ill fix the bug so the percentages are shown in the right order we hope we can entice you tryim more curious about how the plain bars are from these guys  have you tried itwe have had a lot of requests for dark chocolate  bars and we will be sampling it in the new year if you are interested we could send you a sample for tastinglet me knowthat follow your ouitlneedit most of the best writing comes through rewriting rewriting and more rewriting especially if youre working on a substantial project remember you may need to do many drafts before the end result appears polishedshare a second set of eyes may help spot flaws
the fruit in question is sun dried turkish apricots theyre not particularly beautiful to look at but they dont need to bewhether or not you like them will of course come down to how much you like dried fruit these have just the write amount of flavour theyre chew succulent and in my opinion deliciousthats really all there is to these as chocolate snacks go these are probably among the healthier options you could go for perfect for having around the house at christmas  but theyre quite addictive so dont expect them to last longcomments are closed
the first thing i noticed was the presentation from the outset these have the appearance of a home made product the box is nice enough but its generic unbranded apart from the included card and simply decorated with a ribbon the menu for the chocolates is a sticker on the inside of the lidwhether or not you like that approach will likely depend on the kind of gift youre looking for they definitely dont have the refined artisan touch of some of the others in the the guardians test but if youre looking for something with a personal home made touch these might fit the billthe look of the actual chocolates reflects the packaging theyre pretty but uneven with many having feet where the molten chocolate has succumbed to gravity this is something i would have expected the guardians test to at least mention given the immaculate appearance of the likes of rococo demarquette and baruzzo but it was a taste test rather than an appearnace test so lets move on to the flavourswe have panettone xmas pud stem ginger truffle pecan truffle cranberry truffle star praline snowflake praline and golden damsen cup trish hawkins the brains behind cloud cocoland tells me that most of the ingredients used are organic andor fair trade with no preservatives and that does come through in the flavourswhile the chocolate itself seems to be fairly standard i assume belgian couverture the fillings are rather tasty i wasnt a big fan of the extra large golden damson cup but the other flavours were fresh well matched and rather nice some of the ganaches were a little firm for my liking but thats a minor issuethank you dom for your review its great to get an honest opinion and as cloud cocoland continues to grow i will bear in mind your comments  as you very rightly say in your review they appear home made  and they are im really glad you liked the taste  thanks again trishi bought these on the strength of the guardians review  instead of the chocolates i would usually buy from artisan du chocolat i was really disappointed and didnt think they were a patch on artisans chocolate even though priced similarly they were ok but very run of the mill
one look at the chocolates inside should give you an idea of what attracted me to themthe simple blocks of bright colour neatly lined up in the box remind me of crayons which immediately appealed to the child in me this is a six piece gift box but they come in sizes up to  pieces with  different flavours to choose from in my little box i have raspberry valencia orange yuzu wasabi green tea and blueberryall but the green tea feature simple dark chocolate ganaches in a dark chocolate shell and the green tea just uses a white chocolate ganache so as not to completely overwhelm the subtle flavour it really does work and its one of the few tea chocolates ive had where the flavour really shines throughthe raspberry orange and yuzu had the sharp tang of real fruit oil but its done such a way that it doesnt overwhelm the chocolate and you still get a whole range of flavour the other fruit the blueberry is more subtle but equally well rounded the wasabi is peppery and warm but all the chocolate flavours still come throughthese are the perfect illustration of japanese and french attention to detail when it comes to chocolate making and patisserie the flavours themselves are interesting but they dont push any boundaries instead the focus is on getting the flavour balance and presentation absolutely perfectas far as i can make out these chocolates arent available to buy online but if youre in paris tokyo or taipei then i highly recommend seeking out one of sadaharu aokis boutiques and trying them for yourselftheyre so bright i like the idea of wasabi flavour chocolate  ive tried several chili chocolates and find the heat adds an interesting dimension to the chocolatelove the look of these next time im in japanthank you for sharing this i wish i was in paris i have a question or two  is the shiny colorful part also made of chocolate is that where the different flavors are or is it in the ganache thanks
i seem to have found it my duty to personally try each and every chocolate in the box there is enough of a variety that i didnt want to miss anything my tally includes fourteen dark chocolates twelve milk chocolates two milkdarks one white chocolate and two fudge pieces among the group about six are nutty chocolates there are also cream fillings jellies and caramel so the assorted label doesnt exaggerate neither do flavors not textures get left outlet me back up to that curious mention of the milkdark chocolates these are the two wrapped in gold foil which has very fitting subtle stripes on it each block has a top half of milk chocolate and a bottom half of dark there is something nutty in these like a praline nothing is too strong or profound about the combination but i find it rather nicea peculiar piece was a kind of milk chocolate log that reminded me of a twinkie it has a generous dose of caramel inside along with some white chocolate the result is buttery and salty there is a flat dark chocolate circle with a white mint center that certainly has an advantage over regular peppermint patties in its usage of actual chocolate a dark chocolate with a light green filling which i suppose is meant to be lime tastes much like smarties the us candy the milk chocolate with pink strawberry filling reminds me of those cheap yet addicting strawberry wafers and the van otis take on a peanut butter chocolate shares an intriguing resemblance in my eyes to those crumbly mexican peanut candies some of these reminders were entertaining but you can probably tell that the flavored artificially colored fillings didnt impress me nor did the jellies these had a texture more like jello than anything which i do not find goes well with chocolate at all i was glad there were only two of them the caramel thats in some of the chocolates is of a fairly standard stiff natureon a more positive note there was a dark chocolate that stood out from the rest having also a dark fillingganache it isnt highly dark that isnt the point of this collection relying rather on what i term the brownie or fudge decadence which reminds me of those two pieces of fudge one is lighter in color and melts in the mouth in a rather lovely way it has flavor notes almost like light berries the other has some small bits of nuts which i believe are pecans it tastes more of chocolate than the other while still retaining that unique texturelet me give some final comments on appearances the box and most of the chocolates are very simple in their looks there were three chocolates though that stood out to me a dark chocolate molded in the shape of a leaf how can any lord of the rings fan not get excited over that a milk chocolate pentagon with a pretty pink crown on top and a rectangular milk chocolate with a flower pattern on its surface including even just these three does much for the overall appearance when you first open the box perhaps in the future there will be more molds like thisim going to recommend van otis chocolates to fans of sees which i am certainly not who want to branch out more this box is mostly composed of casual confections which dont hold the most weight for me however if you like assorted collections of this nature van otis will keep you happycomments are closed
but despite all the exciting projects hotel chocolat are involved in their bread and butter remains this kind of seasonal novelty itemnot that theres anything wrong with seasonal novelty items hotel chocolat have always been particularly good at them combining great packaging with quality ingredients christmas is of course the perfect time of year for seasonal chocolate and what better form than these cute mini crackersyou get ten crackers in a box each filled with one of five chocolates theres a space to write someones name on each so you can use them as cute place settings or simple decorations unlike proper crackers though these dont crack when you pull them but untwist and open to reveal the chocolate inside its very clever but not quite as satisfying as high explosivesoverall a nice little selection its a bit of a shame you only get one of five chocolates in each cracker theres no paper hat and no cheesy jokes but they still make a nice little table decoration for a christmas dinnercomments are closed
chococo source many of their ingredients locally and organically they use quality couverture including making extensive use of grenada chocolate and that always comes through in their flavoursthis box contains a mix of seasonal flavours and chocolates from the wider chococo range and rather than talking about all sixteen i thought id just pick out some of my favouritesoverall another beautifully made and presented box of chocolates from chococo as a treat for yourself or as a christmas gift you really cant go wrong with this kind of quality theyre available in a variety of sizes but id recommend going for the advent box with  chocolates if you can manage to stick to just one a day you have more willpower than mejealous i wish i wasnt ill last week so i could have helped you that would have been a nice birthday treat  xx
sure theyre mass produced confectionery rather than fine chocolate but they produce quality products and theyre far more accessible than many of our favourite chocolatiers but most importantly they dont add junk like palm oil to their chocolate in the way confectioners like cadbury mars and nestl do in the ukso what we have here is a range of three different  milk chocolate bears very similar to the traditional lindt gold bunnies that appear everywhere at easter theres teeny g bears that either come individually or in a pack of five and a large g bear made from the same chocolate as you can see mine had a bit of a headachebear with a sore headalso available in packs of five are solid mini bears filled with white chocolate a bit like a kinder egg only solid and bear shaped like thisso are they any good well for a christmas stocking filler theyre not bad at all they look great and theyre made from real chocolate unlike the chocolate stocking fillers i used to get as a child usually just a bag of revels stapeled to a stocking shaped piece of cardboardthe milk chocolate is a bit sweet for me but having opened all my bears i still found myself nibbling at them without thinking i think most kids would be happy to find a few of these in their stocking on christmas morning unfortunately they wont be getting mine as theyve all disappeared no idea whereive seen them in stores but thought they can wait for a while ill certainly buy some because no christmas or easter passes by without some lindt figurines  so far the only christmas lindt chocolate bars i got were the winter magic bars irish coffee grog  chocorum i have a bit of a soft spot for lindt myself i love their petits desserts range and i find some of the excellence bars and boxed chocolates very goodi know that the bears are good  how cant they be their chocolate however are they as good as the truffles
oh dear i did a bad thing i started taking chocolate blocks to meetings at work breaking them up and putting them on the meeting room table  my day job is heavily maledominated so it was interesting to see the reaction to this the chaps who might say they dont like  dont eat much chocolate end up wolfing it down what they say and what they do can differ a littleso anyhow after doing this for a while the boss fella was travelling overseas and brought back a whole lot of chocolate from croatia  not for himself but for putting on the meeting room table one per weekof course faced with something like that i threatened to bring in a camera to photograph the packs and take notes i dont think anybody took me seriously until last week when i did unfortunately i missed doing this for the previous weeks sample of a really excellent lemon and black pepper chocolatethis one makes the claim of no added sugar sucrose and is supposed to suitable for diabetics such things make me dubious  suspicious this one uses fructose instead of sucrose to make it healthy the trouble is unless its one of those frankenfoods fructose is still a form of sugar and something that diabetics need to be careful of on the positive side it is perceived as sweeter than sucrose so you need to use less of it and it has a lower glycemic index nevertheless  fructose is not a get out of jail free cardin spite of my dietary rant  whats it likewhen a colleague broke this up into decent meetingsize pieces there is quite a strong rich chocolately aroma in spite of being only  cocoa it is quite dark in appearance the taste is a little slow to develop there is a quite pronounced vanilla overtone and the flavour and intensity develop if you let this sit on the tongue and slowly melt five minutes into tasting this and i could not believe it was only  cocoa  it has a similar flavour to many chocolate that is in the  regionthe universal opinion around the table was that this is pretty good the whole lot was scoffed down and those not in the meeting hoping for the leftovers were both disappointed and slightly annoyed that a greedy bunch of pigs did not bring anything backwhat do you think made the cocoa stand out even though it was only  i love high percentages of cocoa in my chocolate and it would be great to know how to make it that wayi think its common to many    chocolates  made well given time to melt and the sweetness helps but i dont really know im just speculatingah okay  thank you for the response i guess it can always be something i experiment with
i was a little disappointed though when i walked inside the store the design is clean and natural but felt too sparse to me i believe my first impressions carried through my whole experiencei was with one other person at the time choosing a total of six cupcakes to take to share with a couple of other people the final tally was four dark chocolate one vanilla milk chocolate and one chocolate coconut which is the only one i didnt try i started with the vanilla milk chocolate which happens to be the flavor equivalent to the caseys cupcake i had one difference is that i could see the vanilla specks in the caseys cake but not in the sprinkles i dont pretend to remember the exact taste of the former but the sprinkles cupcake struck me as something from a mix simple measured formulaicnicetasting but exemplary im not sure it is obvious though that these are made with quality ingredients the butter in particular is highly noticeable especially in the frosting i think the caseys frosting gave more of an emphasis on sugar than butter another difference is that while my caseys cupcake had shavings of milk chocolate sprinkles naturally sticks to the traditional sprinkle form that is they do for the milk chocolate the dark chocolate sprinkles are in a flat square shape i wrote down in my notes that this seemed definite quality dark chocolate and while the sprinkles website only says that they use belgian chocolate i read somewhere else online that its callebaut chocolate that fitsthe main differences between the vanilla milk and the dark seem to be the sprinkles shape and the cake flavor although the frostings are listed respectively as fudgy milk chocolate cream cheese frosting and bittersweet chocolate frosting i cant say i recall big variations in the two my general comments for the chocolate cake are the same as for the vanilla it was good fresh slightly moist fluffy but didnt thrill me i want desserts to thrill me especially couture cupcakes otherwise what sets them apart from ones i can make at home the frosting and sprinkles i certainly give a passing grade to thoughthey were the part that really started to suggest chocolate truffles to the dark cupcake the cake itself leaves me wanting just one further edgeit may just be the simplistic style im having trouble with goodness knows the little store was packed with customers so ill say that if youre by a store and want a treat step in if you like simplicity or the natural ingredients thing sprinkles also serves red velvet cupcakes in both glutenfree and vegan options give them a try for myself im sure ill end up in the store again since its so close but i will probably be going for less plain flavors like peanut butter chocolate chocolate marshmallow and mocha maybe these will better satisfy my need for something extrai feel the complete opposite as you  sprinkles cupcakes is at a completely different level  sprinkles flavors are delicious and very unique from one another  caseys frosting tastes like waxy lard and the cake has no specific flavor  i would find it difficult to tell each cupcake apart during a blindfolded taste test  one thing that sets sprinkles apart is that they are constantly baking cupcakes on site for most of the day  unfortunately caseys has there cupcakes prepared offsite and shipped in daily at  am  that means their cupcakes taste worse as the day gets later  i work in laguna beach and agree with most of the locals who also dislike caseys cupcakes  like the exterior attractiveness of the shop the cupcakes are only pleasing to the eye and unfortunately not the taste buds  that is probably why the store went out of business
but as much as i enjoyed the festive flavours these simple royal merina ganaches are some of my favourite chocolates around at the moment named after the merina madagascan monarchy these simple chocolates are something a bit special marc has managed to come up with a way of volumising the ganache not just to make more of it but also to enhance the flavour of the chocolatethe chocolate in question is a  madagascan dark chocolate and its used for both the ganache and the shell the ganache itself is infused with madagascan vanilla before being combined with the chocolate and undergoing the volumising process so this really gives youre really getting a true madagascan flavourim not sure what the volumising involves  the chocolates are sizeable but thats a choice thats been made by the chocolatier its not the lightest ganache ive ever tried but its incredibly smooth in texturebut its the flavour that sets these chocolates apart the subtle fruitiness of the madagascan cocoa beans combined with the delicate vanilla make them almost irresistible its the vanilla that comes through first then as the chocolate melts the flavours develop in your mouth theres a pleasant sweetness but theyre never sickly just sweet enough to leave you wanting another then anotherthese chocolates won three gold stars at the great taste awards and its easy to see why theyre elegantly simple and utterly delicious as with all of demarquettes range you know youre getting quality chocolate made with etichically sourced ingredientsif youre looking for an understated christmas gift for a true chocolate lover that really shows how much you care then this should be top of your listit looks simple and delicious
but perhaps the most impressive thing about this particular box is the packaging there may only be  chocolates inside but the box itself weighs in at a whopping kg and its something most people will want to keep long after the chocolates have goneinside the intricately designed and cutout cardboard sleeve is a a dark red box made from an unidentifiable material that has the feel of bakelite this is where the bulk of the weight comes from inside the box is divided into two distinct halves containing a heritage collection and contemporary collectionyou also a little card which tells you the number of your box in the limited edition run of  im number the first thing you notice when you open the box is that you get two of most of the chocolates thats a little disappointing given you only get  in the box and only  of those are unique and while it looks as though there are two layers there is only one in fact given the way the chocolates are supported on cardboard inserts it looks like the box may have been originally intended to contain two layers but for whatever reason the final product ended up with only one if id actually paid  for this box mine were a free review sample i think i would have found that disappointingthat gripe aside lets move on to the chocolates themselves starting with the heritage sidelemon manaonone of two white chocolates in the box although the leaflet describes it as milk chocolate in fact this is nothing like how the leaflet describes it its a simple white chocolate with a white chocolate and lemon creme filling a little sweet but very pleasantgrand marniera grand marnier truffle in dark chocolate this one tastes like every other grand marnier chocolate youve ever had it has a buttery texture and a bit of an alcoholic kick to it rio butterscotchapparently this was a big hit when it was launched  years ago but its not really my thing a whole brazil nut dipped in butterscotch then in dark chooclate then rolled in icing sugar im not a great fan of nuts particularly whole ones in chocolate and this was just a little chewy and sweet for my tastesnoisettethe recipe for this is apparently from the original thorntons continental recipe book hazelnut  marc de champagne mousse in dark chocolate this ones too sweet for mecaramel cupan oldfashioned unsalted caramel in milk chocolate apparently this is reminiscent of norman thorntons first caramels back in  but its clear to see that tastes have changed the caramel is buttery and ultra sweet without much flavour you dont get much caramel inside but even so its way too sweet for mealmond rochercaramelised almonds in milk chocolate with a touch of orange peel simple but tastycrudo chocolate blocka solid block along the lines of thorntons current range of miniblocks the texture and flavour of this bar are supposed to replicate the kind of chocolate that would have been available  years ago it has a rich chocolate flavour with added cinnamon nutmeg and sea salt the texture is much coarser than youd find in most modern chocolate and the overall experience is really quite interestingand so we move on the contemporary collectionraspberry and rose ganachethis chocolate won a gold medal at this years academy of chocolate awards its a layer of raspberry jelly with a raspberry and rose creme in a dark chocolate shell a very pleasant chocolate with a sharp refreshing flavourmango and orange crmea mango and orange creme with a layer of orange confit in milk chocolate although quite sweet i enjoyed the zingy fruitiness of this one i think theres a bit of a clash going on with the milk chocolate but overall its a very refreshing fruity chocolatelime and chillia modern classic  lime and chilli ganache in milk chocolate ive tried many versions of this chocolate over the last couple of years and this may be one of my favourites you instantly get the zesty lime flavour then the heat of the chilli builds slowly very nice indeedcrunchy salted

pyramid a little to scifi looking for mecrunchy caramel pralineanother praline  one of three in the contemporary side this one features has pieces of caramelised sugar and is wrapped in swiss dark

milk chocolate topped with white chocolate i really liked the freshness the orange brings to this praline one of my favouritesstrawberry and balsamic ganachea milk chocolate  balsamic vinegar ganache with a layer of strawberry jelly in dark chocolate one of my favourite flavour combinations with a very pleasant smooth texturesummaryis this value for money at  well by most measures absolutely not its a beautiful box with some great handmade chocolates but with only  in the box working out at roughly  each thats still basically double what you would pay for the finest fine chocolates and not all of these chocolates are out and out winnersbut this isnt about the chocolates its a unique item that has been produced in such low numbers that im quite sure thorntons arent making any money from them even at  i think that if youre at all tempted by these chocolates you have to put aside the cost and think of it more as a work of art it could be a collectors item that you could keep untouched and hand down to future generations if it werent for the fact that the chocolates will probably eventually go mouldy and consume the box so maybe best to just eat the chocolates and save the boxthey arent widely available  partly because theyve given so many of the  to press and bloggers i assume they are listed on the thorntons website as available soon though if you do manage to get hold of one it would make an amazing gift for a very lucky chocaholic but best not to tell them how much it cost
the bar itself looked rather mundane  from the outside there was milk chocolate which was helpfully labelled at  and it had a decent sheen to it too but cracking open one of the squares revealed an ominous black liquid i jumped init wasnt nearly as bad as i thought it was going to be the filling was a mixture of the salty liquorice and toffee meaning it was a little sweeter than i expected and the saltiness was more subtle only arriving at the end of the whole adventure or to put it another way i survived and actually went back for more the sweet and salty mixture wasnt unlike all the various salted caramels ive had but the addition of the liquorice added an interesting twist that was rather goodthat said by the midway point the novelty was wearing off and by the end i had decided that it was best enjoyed in small doses because the toffee was getting to that cloying stage and i was glad when it was all over but i no longer suffer from saltyliquoritis which im sure must be an actual medical condition and was able to look at the plopp wrapper again and laugh oh those wacky swedesi am swedish and have lived here my whole life and i still dont get saltlakrits i hate it but i always loved plopp the normal flavor i even had cravings for it during my first pregnancy but its not for the quality
you see this  gram fish is something i decided from the start i wouldnt share with anyone though thats what i usually try to do so i let this fish represent pure silliness and happinessat the start i thought to use the same fork and knife from the photo shoot to dig into the chocolate with there is just something about eating chocolate with a fork like it is a real food but that didnt last very long it has been much more fun to nibble away at the whole fish without bothering to break off pieces as i would have to if i were sharing its as if im recreating the joyous abandonment of a giant chocolate easter bunny just with a salmon instead the salmon is more entertaining in my opinionnow however i must admit the sordid details ending my ramblings about the perfection of combining chocolate and salmon this northwest catch salmon is labelled as milk chocolate its a relatively dark milk chocolate i have no objections toward that quite the contrary but i had to get used to this chocolate before proceeding into my happy devouring of it it isnt compounded chocolate yet there is something almost oily about the way it melts perhaps it has a composition that better allows it to be molded yet even the molding the main feature here could be more perfect there is just a bit of excess chocolate on the tail of the fish and its head gets slightly banged up from the box but let me return to taste its fashioned with notes of cinnamon that help its tendency toward a darker edge especially in confectionarynovelty terms it hits that middle section between sweet milk chocolate and bittersweet dark not precisely in either categorycomments are closed
the packaging doesnt give too much information about these other than the fact that theyre dried blueberries covered in milk chocolate but luckily the press release that came with them gives a bit more information the chocolate is in fact  cocoa solids made from west african beans and the blueberries are wild and nordic although it doesnt actually say which country they come fromthe press release also talks about how blueberries are a superfood and that wild blueberries have been found to have five times more antioxidants than farmed ones but none of that is important if they dont taste good and they really doif you like chocolate coated raisins then the chances are youll like these the milk chocolate is nice enough but nothing to write home about its sweet and creamy and the blueberry flavour comes through the moment you put them in your mouth quite impressive given blueberry isnt a particularly strong flavourthe blueberries may be dried but theyre still quite plump and juicy and they taste really rather tasty this may not be fine chocolate but the flavours work very well together  its one of those snacks thats very difficult to stop eating once you start so its probably a good thing that they only come in a g bagunfortunately these dont seem to be available to buy online at the moment so if you want to try them for yourself youll have to pop into nordic bakery in londons soho or marylebone  and thats something id recommend doing anywayi love blueberries wonder if they do them with dark chocolatei was wondering the same thing but the milk chocolate versions work surprisingly well
i love it when i get toffee samples as im a fan of toffee but hardly ever buy it myself there are two kinds here the first is a halfpound sixpiece clear bag of almond toffee that sells for  which i find perfectly reasonable the format is a  in cm toffee square covered in milk chocolate and rather finely ground almonds despite the fineness of the almonds theyre stuck on well and dont make much mess either in the bag or during eating theres a bonus of even more almond pieces blended into the toffee yet even with such almondcentric traits all elements have balance there is much crunch but its still creamy this is because the chocolate just called belgian is of good quality that shows the almonds bring with them a taste of salt the toffee has the proper crunch clarity and flavor nicely donein a smaller bag with an orangepatterned cloth ribbon typing it up are two pieces of pecan toffee these pieces were slightly bigger more like   in this time its  belgian dark chocolate that coats the toffee a pecan half is set in the corner of each square with smaller bits flowering out from it i like this look its unpretentious but also detailed and thoughtful enough to show that the pecans werent just slapped on this does mean however that you only taste the pecans in less than half the square thats a downside for me as i like the warmth they addit provides a connection between the dark chocolate and the toffee i prefer the way that the milk chocolate blends with the toffee however if youre a belgian dark chocolate fan this format does allow you to focus on that factor while still getting enough toffee and pecansi was excited to try the sipping chocolate drinking chocolate instead of plain hot chocolate mixes usually isnt easy to come by the design of the  oz box is in keeping with wiseman houses minimalist look the brown box with gold lettering doesnt overdo anything in the ingredients interestingly are belgian chocolate american milk chocolate and venezuelan chocolate all chocolate no junkthe chocolate is in small pieces like tiny pebbles tempting me to dig in with a spoon what the directions call for is whisking a cup of the chocolate into a cup of boiling water and serving in espresso cups even if you dont have espresso cups youll want to take that as a guideline to not serve yourself too much having such a high chocolate content this really is a beverage for sipping im hesitant to say it has bitterness as there is a good amount of creamy flavor the fact of it is that all three of the chocolate types blended in have their influence this drink is rich but with lighter and darker notes its one to take in slowly also being thicker than hot chocolates its a great experience just note that you have to be okay with the darker more intense side of chocolate to enjoy itone of the perks of writing for chocablog is that i get introduced to so many companies i like the tone of wiseman house they dont remind me of anybody else and they approach chocolate maturely im looking forward to trying morecomments are closed
the front of the pack helpfully also tells me that its made from trinitario beans is stone ground and conched for  hours if only all chocolate labelling were so clearthis is a little different to the mast brothers bar  for one thing its a milk chocolate and for another the salt is added to the chocolate itself rather than simply being sprinkled on top the result is a consistent flavour rather than an instant salthit and i think i prefer it this waysuch an exciting discovery benoit nihant was at the show really loved this too  hope they get uk distributionthis is my new favourite sweetsalty chocolate bar that i discovered at chocolate unwrapped too
for a bar with such a lot going on inside it has a fairly neutral chocolate aroma with only the slightest hint of florafruit aromas as you might expect the first flavour to appear when tasting is the ginger the warmth is almost immediate but unlike a lot of ginger chocolates it tends to stay fairly low key as the jasmine green tea lends softer floral notes to the mix the goji berries are there at the end  tiny fragments of bright citrussy fruit making for a clean lightly acidic finishall things considered i thought the balance of flavours was done really well each element is evident and the overall effect of the combination is very pleasant indeed its an unusual set of flavours but in combination they work very well together and the chocolate is rather moreish what i do take exception to is the blurb on the packaging someone cranked up the pretentious foodie guff machine to eleven for this bar i quotekarma comes to mind as the green tea  jasmine enlighten you and if that wasnt enough try this for size  the melting chocolate escapes and fills your eager mouth as the tip of your tongue splits lasciviously with slight flicked zeal it glides slowly across moistened lips making way for that full on goji berry experiencenow as far as i can tell that isnt even english it is most definitely the worst kind of twaddle and the sort of thing that is guaranteed to turn me into my old english master no no and no that sort of pretentious nonsensical foodie garbage is the stuff of satire theres really no place for itso great tasting chocolate sensibility  offending packaging blurb i can only hope someone has another look at whats written on fyis product range and decides to save us from further abuse of the english languagecomments are closed
ive always been a fan of orange in chocolate so this blend of mandarin and spices seemed like a home run to me at least on paper and with all those flavours in the mix i wasnt particularly bothered about the chocolate being too dominant  but it is rather lovely  creamy and the perfect base for the assorted spices and coming in at  percentagewise the bar itself is only g and as has been noted here before that makes for a very very thin barthe confusion comes with the balance of all the flavours the back of the box lists cinnamon ginger clove nutmeg black pepper and vanilla but someone went a little crazy with the cloves it is all about the cloves at least initially and by the time they make way for the slight hint of mandarin all the other spices have more or less disappeared too it isnt unpleasant by any means but it is a bit disappointing considering the flavour explosion i had imagined prior to unwrapping the baranyway no matter what the chocolate tastes like it is all for a good cause and the puppies and kittens will thank you no matter what  comments are closed
a small review for a small chocolate but one thats good enough that its worth mentioning anywaytheres no labelling on the box so i cant give much details but i can tell you is the shells are dark chocolate with a hint of red colouringinside there are two layers a lower layer of praline and nuts and a top layer of caramel its sweet but light in both flavour and texture so its never too much the praline layer is wonderfully crunchy and tasty and the dark chocolate just takes the edge of the sweetnessin short theyre absolutely divine my only regret is that i only had this one and i dont think theres any chance ill be able to get more until i get back to franceif youre lucky enough to come across them yourself dont let them pass you by and pick us up a box or seventhose look so goodi bet they are tasty but i find the shape really weirdly disturbing i think that its lips but then a sort of platform underneath odd
it is a part of the truffle bars line which means that it is a small  gram bar that breaks into four squares a g network if you will each with truffle filling inside the two or three dollar price tag is a premium compared with other ontheshelf offerings but isnt that about how much one maybe two godiva truffle will cost you in a boutique its up to you if the truffle bars are a value or notbreaking into one of the four gs you will find that the smooth caramel apple filling is of that nature where it is essentially liquid that doesnt flow freely which can work out to be a positive its seasoned well with apple and cinnamon although i think its debatable whether or not the caramel sense is strong enough its on the subtle side but then again would too much caramel make this too sweet the spiced flavorings arent overly strong either in this case however they sit at a nice levelwhat the tempered filling means is that the sweetness of this bar is basically just coming from the milk chocolate ive spoken about godivas milk chocolate before so i wont go into it too much it makes for the mellow accompaniment to the filling adding a level of casualty one more thing to note in comparing a truffle bar to an actual truffle is that i do believe the chocolate to filling ration is larger here especially around the edges of the squares there is an extra bit of chocolate that isnt paired up as evenly with the filling i suppose my overall opinion is favorable even if there isnt much to swoon over this is a pleasant chocolate for a fall afternoon its sweet its warm its momentary and the bar including the size of the squares is just the right size for either keeping to yourself or sharingi love all your blog 
pieces of dried apples in honey caramel whisper softly in a layer of cinnamon and yellow chocolate yellow chocolate okaypop a sliver in your mouth and it comes over as being somewhere between a chocolate bar and a german christmas treat  a little like a stollen or a christmas cookie with the fruityboozy elements right up there the filling isnt completely smooth  there are fragments of dried apple and cranberry to nibble on and its also very definitely a grown up christmas bar booziness notwithstanding the cinnamon and apple combination is unlikely to appeal to smaller chocophilesthis bar put me in mind of a particularly fine christmas beer i had a couple of years ago fruit a little spice and a warming undercurrent of alcohol mingle with rich dark chocolate perfect with a mug of hot chocolate and a rosy cheeked womanso if youre a person who enjoys deliberately sic and you have a taste for continental christmas treats this bar could well be right for you if youre not a fan of spicy fruity boozy chocolate bars id give this one a miss personally i found myself really enjoying it but i didnt feel the urge to eat more than a couple of pieces at a timewhere is the difference between continental christmas and notcontinental christmas and on the note of i didnt feel the urge to eat more than a couple of pieces at a time zottor chocolates are not suppose to be eaten when you have the munchies its rather a treat for adults who can appreciate the art that stand behind it
each layer has layer contains  chocolates meaning you get  in this g boxthe chocolates themselves are thin counters of milk chocolate with just enough room inside for a small amount of salted caramel in truth packaging small chocolates in this way is probably not particularly efficient but they do look good and the box completely protects the chocolates from any damage  something thats very important if youre buying them as a giftthe milk chocolate is quite sweet and creamy but still very moreish i think this is partly down to the small size of the chocolates one chocolate is never quite enough and even if you try to restrain yourself its all too easy to eat a whole layer in a matter of minuteslike the chocolate the caramel is also sweet but theres so little of it that each chocolate you eat makes you crave another just to get a bit more of the soft sweet centreoverall i personally prefer the variety and substance of the milk  dark abanico assortment i reviewed previously but these are still very very nice in fact my only real complaint is that theyre perhaps a little too addictive and that beautiful box is empty before you know itcomments are closed
the question is of course what does one do with something like this the container itself suggests to put it over cupcakes coffee tea buttered toast and ice cream which are certainly enough for a beginning but before i get into those i want to look at the composition of this productit may be useful to start at the ingredients list brown candy sugar white candy sugar chocolate flakes and coffee beans although im not sure it affects the taste much the inclusion of two different colored sugars does have visual interest these are in chunks slightly bigger than most salt grinders have the chocolate flakes are smaller and do not make up a very great percentage of the whole as you can sort of see from a closeup on the container the coffee beans are in halves which means that they tend to be the biggest pieces after being groundwhat with a good amount of this mixture being sugar i did feel a little odd grinding some over ice cream as if ice cream needs more sugar i was also wishing that cinnamon what i usually add was also involved as it was a slight crunch and something of a coffee taste were what i got the same goes for on top of cupcakes yes i tried that tooi couldnt turn down the excuse for cupcakes as i drink both coffee and tea black that combination was never going to be my favorite but it does add an interesting hint of flavor along with the sugar that most people add anyway i could see someone getting accustomed to adding this to their usual coffee or tea maybe even to shakesbut my definite favorite is on the buttered toaste this is what allows you to taste all three elements even if the chocolate still comes up last its a simple twist on butter and sugar but with more flavor its also much more entertaining to sprinkle a concoction of three or four elements on toast rather than just plain sugarso as strange as this new item is i rather like it along similar lines to my preference for salt and pepper in the same format i would complain that there is not enough chocolate but i cant say that the marketing was wrongsugar appears on the labeling in much larger letters than does chocolatecomments are closed
to be honest i think chocolate and caviar are unlikely to ever be available as a pairing unless someone like paul a young reads this and decides to prove me wrong no dear reader im happy to report that the  cocoa extra quality seal design gives the game away pop the top of this jar and inside youll find g of tiny purplyred eggs of dark extra bitter chocolatei literally gasped when i saw your tweet this looks amazing
having had the chance to try a lot more of his chocolate that passion really shows in the finished product without exception pacaris products are unique distinctive and packed full of flavourthe chocolate is dark in colour with a nice glossy appearance and a pleasing snap  a very different experience from any other raw chocolate ive triedthe flavour is incredible the salt is initially quite predominant but as soon as the chocolate starts to melt all kinds of wonderful flavours start to appear theres a distinctly woody note  partly enhanced by the raw cacao nibs a green grasslike notes banana and finally a warm caramel thats highlighted by the salt its quite difficult to believe that just four ingredients cacao beans cane sugar salt and sunflower lecithin can produce such a range of flavourtotally agree about how moreish this stuff is i have a third of a bar left  im eking it out slowly it really is remarkable stuff
it is a wonderful little coffee shop with a ridiculously well stocked deli plus the owner johanna woodhead also turns out to be an artisan chocolatier with plenty of her wares on display i gravitated towards the glass case which had an assortment of handmade chocolates and got one of each i neglected to make any notes about the names of the chocolates but im pretty sure im not a million miles awayso all in all a very nice collection and a very pleasant surprise at the end of breakfast i shall definitely make a return visit next time im in kirriemuir and in the meantime i just need to coax a friend to send some other goodies from there until im back in scotland again degrees  high street kirriemuir dd ba scotlandpoint takenchef couldnt agree more  i was taiknlg to another chef friend of mine about how september is the best time of year to be cooking  i love the fall flavors and after months of light summery dishes i look forward transitioning into earthier flavors of autumn  but that narrow  week window in between seasons provides such interesting combinations  i like what youve done above  i recently i did scallops with apple fennel puree late season broccoli shoots hazelnuts and crispy fried scrapple
its darker than the previous bar with much bigger initial flavours and a longer deeper finish like the previous idilio bar i found it all too easy to eat the finish is clean light and long and leaves you wanting just that one piece more which has to be the sign of a good chocolate as yet theres still no sign of uk distribution for idilio but if youre in france germany or indeed switzerland id recommend keeping an eye out for idilios distinctively clinical looking packaging comments are closed
these orangettes are described as reel orange peel dipped in dark chocolate the chocolate in question is a  dark chocolate of unspecified origin unfortunately i didnt enjoy them at all the chocolate is quite bland and doesnt have much flavour of its own and while the orange inside has an initially pleasant flavour theres an artificial edge that quickly makes itself knowni like crystallised fruit and i was really looking forward to these however they just didnt taste like the natural artisan chocolate product theyre positioning themselves as im used to artisan chocolate having a shelf life of no more than two weeks rather than a yearperhaps i had a bad batch but i can only really base a review on the samples i have and unfortunately i didnt enjoy theselts sad that even artisan chocolates dont avoid that artificial junk these daysfor one of the slovenian artisan chocolates l went to the shop to ask if there was truly a real vanilla inside as stated on a label and they said yesbut l still think it was an artificial vanillinthe taste was a bit of an artificial sweetenerso different from the real vanillaas a chocoholic l guess l may know the differencel guess
its light on the palate melting quickly and with a light acidity and soft slightly fruity opening notes as the chocolate starts to melt further depths are revealed as more of the cacao flavours are unleashed although its only a percentage point below  this chocolate doesnt have the thickness some chocolate can have  its light on the tongue and easy on the palate the balance of dark cacao and fragrant sweetness is done very well indeedwhen alls said and done its a nice enough chocolate but it also happens to be kind of ordinary and with a top end price tag it really needs to have something special going on the bottom line is that if you gave me  and told me to buy myself a bar of chocolate this wouldnt even come close to being in my top five even though its a smooth well balanced barof the two i definitely prefer the rum  raisin version mainly because those additional ingredients result in an excellent version of an old classic on its own blend ii is a decent but unremarkable chocolate compared to similarly priced offerings from other manufacturerscomments are closed
the tagline on both bags states take a bite close your eyesthis moment is yours the description lines are in the same frilly indulgence terms cocoa fudge escape for instance is described like this layers of moist fudgy brownie and rich decadent fudge all enveloped in a shell of cocoakissed perfection that should give you a good idea of the type of product hereas far as the flavors go well there isnt too much variety anyway when i cut the brownies in half the layers showed themselves off not so well as on the packaging in tasting i nearly always forgot about the caramel layer that separates the cheesecake and brownie halves of the caramel cheesecake im sure this one tastes different from the raspberry version but the caramel doesnt speak out very much on its own even though i really dont like cheesecake i do find the cheesecake brownies more interesting than the plain cocoa fudge ones there all you have are two layers of brownie that are said to be split by fudge the cheesecake element i find to add more diversity and singularitymost people will probably find that it adds to the idea of indulgenceindulgence is the word i cant argue with here the sweet moments arent pretty enough or fine enough to serve to company but when its just for the household theyre more ready and available than a brownie mix i would categorize them in the same spot as boxes of entenmanns donuts i do though have one last problem the top of the bag opens by tearing after which there is no seal to close the bag up again i point this out because this is the sort of product you can have in your refrigerator while you slowly take out one or two brownies at a timeshouldnt the rest be able to stay safe and fresh in the meantime oh well i guess i never did notice a difference because of this the indulgence is too simple to be bothered by suchcomments are closed
feeding your imagination is one of what appear to several business ventures being run by one paul da costagreaves a master chef restauranteur and chocolatier formerly based in devon but now relocated to bristoli came across him at the recent speciality  fine food fair at olympia and he very kindly sent me home with a small stack of his wares it was only when i came home and happened to mention thisto dom that he said it probably wont be a huge shock to learn that the chocolate smells of mint i would have been surprised had it not what i was interested to discover was whether the cardamom had any chance of making a showing against such a dominating flavour i can only think that paul has spent the past couple of years refining his recipes because i have no hesitation in recommending this bar its a jolly good example of how well mint and milk chocolate can go togetherthis and the other bars in the range can be purchased online or from an interesting variety of stockists have a look at the list of london stockists and see what i mean about interesting and after this first taste im very much looking forward to telling you more about fyi chocolatesthis sounds like a divine bar i too love mint and i love cardamom but would never have thought of putting them together how lucky you are to have tried this bar thanks for sharing your thoughts
the ginger flavour is subtle very subtle if you dont like ginger as much as i do thats fair enough but when i bought a bar called crystallised ginger i was hoping for chunks of ginger embedded in the chocolate preferably very large chunks alas this chocolate is entirely smooth and while it does have some ginger flavour theres no heat at alli dont know that i was ever going to be completely satisfied by a ginger bar without a real kick and thats not necessarily rococos fault the chocolate is nice enough its just too subtle for meto be honest im a bit worried that rococo might fall foul of trades descriptions here  to specify crystallized ginger rather than merely ginger in the name of the bar could reasonably be interpreted as a clear indication that the bar actually contains er crystallized ginger that it does not could reasonably be interpreted as misleading worrying to see this from a maker as usuallyreliable as chococodisappointing a crystallised ginger bar really needs discernible bits and flavour both
the chocolate has quite a woody citrussy smell about it and when it hits the palate its immediately incredibly smooth and soft on the tongue those woody acidic notes are there right away backed up by quite mellow well rounded cacao with a hint of deep red fruit the finish is clean with a lingering citruswood note the packaging blurb mentions that this cacao has a hint of the local pitanga fruit about it but of course im not in a position to be able to confirm or deny that particular claimthe family monte alegre lived in the last century in the city of so paulo there is today an avenue dedicated to this familywere very traditional at the time i do not know why but they went to bahia and founded the farm monte alegre which they manufacture excellent spices today it is one of the most traditional chocolates here in brazilthanks for sharing with uscheersrenan ferrer
this particular offering is quite simple distinct layers of blackcurrant reduction and seasalted caramel covered in dark chocolateive always loved pauls seasalted caramels the whole salted caramel thing isnt quite as fashionable as it was a few years ago but this is still one of my favourites it has a real depth of flavour to it but its never too sweet or too saltythe blackcurrant layer is fruity tangy and sharp it has a real zing to it that works perfectly with the dark chocolate yet im not completely convinced it works with the caramel the flavours are very different and for me they just dont quite work together i find myself wanting individual separate salted caramels and blackcurrant chocolates i think this is probably a subjective thing and some people will love the combination but theyre not really for me luckily i know ill just have to wait ten minutes and therell likely be another  additions to the paul a young range for me to try and try them i willanother step closer to the resurrection of cadburys blackcurrant eclairs yay i bet id love these since i love salty caramels are you listening santai love most of pauls stuff but i think the salted caramel thing has now run its course
anyhow the reaction when i opened this to share around was very positive with one attendee saying gee  something that actually tastes like it says on the pack i have to agree so much so i went and bought another to photograph and taste properly so i could write about ithi
at home i surveyed the card box further the pictures on it are made to look like paper cutouts that have been taped in place and the color blue that accents the front and covers the sides and back is modeled after the sea with just a hint of green in its tones inside the box lurks an eightheaded being glossyfaced and resplendent in rich brown with no visible imperfections from its molding its back is set at intervals with shiny scales called stunning black sea salt evaporated in above ground pools that form naturally from lava flows in hawaii as i began to break this monster from the depths into pieces i noted that it is all too easy due to the liquid inside to break not quite along the lines that mark out the eight heads resulting in a bit of a mess but i bravely trudged on with my journey of discoveryfurther notes on the three stages of the chocolate being wouldnt be amiss the salt crystals are of varying sizes allowing for different experiences that are never overpowering the caramel is rather dark in color freeflowing as i mentioned and rather rich as well that dark personality the chocolate may be the darkest of the three but it doesnt scare me it leans toward a tender side too like the red tones of chocolate chips it hasnt the most complexity nor the leastand oh dear i find that what once had eight square heads now only has three left my my this journey was more adventurous than id expected what more can i say but this for two dollars it wont literally take you to the setting of a novel but if you put your imagination into it youll get pretty closei love this chocolate bar toolove the packaging the contents look pretty good as welli like this bar for  too and its companion trader joes dark chocolate bar  toffee with walnuts and pecans i dont know which one i like better and i usually prefer milk to dark chocolateas an avid chocolate lover  and not so avid trader joes shopper  i now have reason to visit the store that chocolate bar looks amazing nice blog too ill be back for more great infoi believe this to be made by vosges haut chocolat in chicago perhaps its black salt caramel bar that sells for about  or more i find it a hard bar to eat and maybe vosges did too but what a steal for a great bar of chocolate just need to rinse up afterwardstrading is like a university eoucdtian it requires on the order of  to  years to become proficient and you have to be ready to accept it as a full time career with that said the broker that i use is oanda i use this broker mainly because it allows smaller lot sizes which allows me to be very flexible with my exposuremy recommendation do not trade with less than k account do not trade live until you have risk capital money that you will not need or regret losing or minimum few years on paper accounts research is a huge topic do not fall for technical analysis it works in some situations but the best bet would be to read the prices correctly via price patterns and timing do not trade during non farm payrolls or during tokyo and ny lunch hour trade during the overlap of us uk sessions for best liquidity watch for inflation levels what central bankers say and if what they are saying is just a warning or if they are serious about itfor example you would want to monitor the japanese central bank decisions right now because their  is strong enough to make their bank sell it to lower the price to keep exports competitive for cad watch for gold prices oil is their major export ectfinally the only way to make money in  safely is with law of large numbers in terms of capitalization you have to have an account upwards of  mil so this is not a get rich quick thing the real money lies in market making and dealing
okay before we go any further can i ask a favour just read that title again please now think about it for a minute so what about the chocolate well from my immediate point of view oak smoked salt sounded wonderful and with the promise of a few top quality cacao nibs to chew on as the milk chocolate melted away i was sold duffys explanation of the salting process i just sprinkle salt over the bars its completely random and the fact it was smoked salt had me on the verge of a homer simpson moment right thereso what can you expect from this latest creation assuming you can get hold of one a rich milky chocolate with a creamy softness spiked with little peaks from the smoked salt which softens off some of the saltiness but also adds its own intriguing almost savoury flavours into the mix as the chocolate melts away and the final tang of the salt disappears youre left with the crunchy nutty cacao nibs to finish that nutty slightly earthy flavour and light acidic finish were a perfect end to a real taste adventure and provided that final grown up element that lift this chocolate further towards greatness yep i love it it has to be one of the best milk chocolates i have ever tasted and it is in no small way due to duffys inspired choice of extrasone thing you can definitely say about red star chocolate is that it will always surprise and delight i dont know how he does it but duffy has been getting his hands on small batches of amazing cacao beans almost since day one and when you consider that day one wasnt all that long ago hes doing pretty well at this chocolate making lark hes turning into something of a rare cacao wizard and i can only hope for more from red star chocolate in the near futureyou may be able to find this bar at paul a youngs shops at some point it isnt currently on the red star site but believe me its worth findingso jealousstopping myself from eating more took real effort anyone who even gets a sniff at this is on my a list no mistake
despite my involvement in the awards i dont think ive actually had a chance to try clerkenwells chocolates before my time there was mainly spent entering numbers into spreadsheets and i hardly got to try any chocolate so ive very much been looking forward to getting my hands on theseas you can see the presentation is very simple dare i say plain it does the job of containing the chocolates inside and nothing more but sometimes thats all you needthe chocolates inside are also quite simple dark not too shiny with a small fleck of gold leaf on each one open one up and youll find a thin shell with plenty of smooth dark ganche insidebut its also great on its own and these truffles are the perfect example of how good a simple plain dark truffle can be when its made by someone who knows what theyre doing  and clerkenwell clearly know what theyre doing as this chocolate as deliciousthe thin shell is sweet but doesnt have any distinct flavour notes of its own i assume thats a deliberate decision so as not to obliterate the flavour of the ganache and the moment you bite into the shell that smooth fruity creamy ganache comes to the front and its really very good indeed the cream takes the edge off the madagascan citrus notes but a touch of fleur de sel seems to lift the deeper chocolatey notes just a littlemy only real problem with these chocolates is that i was only sent a box of four i guess ill just have to buy some more  along with the rest of clerkenwells range they dont seem to be available to buy online yet but if youre in london youll find them at kaffeine  great titchfield street from late september go check them outbeans from madagascar renowned for their sweet fruity citrus flavoursthat made me think of michel cluizels mangaro noir   really fruity i love thatthats why i love madagascan chocolate so much fruitya well rounded in terms of flavor but uncompromisingly chocolate truffle can make an argument for being the most delicious food possible per capita in my opinion its very pinnacle of the candy and desert experience
this time the chocolate is joined by one of my perennial favourites cocoa nibs but its the sugars that win the initial taste battle more or less crushing the cacao opposition from the off what cacao flavours are there are fairly bland and uninteresting putting this firmly ino the mass produced confectionery bracket in my book despite leonidas impressive pedigreeon the basis of the two bars and a box of pralines i had a while back i cant help but feel that leonidas and other long established chocolate companies have stagnated to some extent yes i know that globally there hasnt been an upsurge of interest in fine chocolate in the way that there has been in london and other parts of the uk but i had expected something a little more exciting than what i ended up with the best part was the nibs at the end but after two chunks i didnt even want to have to eat the chocolate to get to the nibs my final word dull formulaic chocolate with too much sugar in it from a company trading on its name if swiss companies like lindt can produce fresh looking innovative products surely you could do similar time to update your range i feel because this sort of thing isnt going to cut it for much longerleonidas is indeed legendaryawesome made to look like embossed gold bars
i seem to have unintentionally made candy my focus recentlyi really picked up these chocolate dips with curiosity not making previous assumptions about what they would be like theyre the sort of thing you ought to approach casually right especially when you factor in the description from the back jelly belly beans take a dip in rich dark chocolate to bring you a tidal wave of deliciousness gourmet jelly beans meet up with chocolate wowwow is the word alright surf speech paired with gourmet can either mean a successful combination of the two sides or just plain randomness maybe its a good thing i didnt read this until after tastingbecause the fact is im growing rather fond of these chocolatecovered cherry jelly beans i hardly know what constitutes a gourmet jelly bean since ive barely ever tasted any not made by jelly belly but i am coming to see that there is perhaps a reason why they are so dominant i detect a great deal of balance the chocolate is at just the precise thickness to make its presence distinctly yet not overbearingly known despite having chocolate and jelly beans paired up i dont feel like im eating too much sweet stuff that may also be due to the nice tiny size of the beans that i never took the time to appreciate before and in case anyone needed to ask no the jelly beans do not taste like real cherries and no the chocolate is not gourmet even if the jelly beans may be but i find that in this case i really dont care it isnt as if there are negative flavorsmy only complaint is that i wish the chocolate had the familiar white jelly belly stamp on it it would complete the look so much more not that the stamp would slow me down eating these or anything like thatthese sound awesome i love jelly belly jelly beans anyway but dipped in chocolate sounds like my heaven nom nom nom this is yummy i hide this away from the hubby because i want it all for myself btw here in manila the ones sold here have the jelly belly stampi found these in a candy store in santa barbara today  they are good
so with the understanding that im making educated guesses with the aid of google translate i can tell you that the company is run by tomka sienkiewicza and krzyska stypulkowskiego or krzysiek and tomek as they sign themselves theyre a couple of schoolfriends based in ceglow which is just east or warsaw and are a beantobar chocolate maker in fact theyre the only beantobar chocolate company in poland and  they use only organic beans in their bars and no product is ever more than six months oldthe chocolate itself comes lovingly wrapped in very thick gold foiled covered paper and had a deep dark colour the chocolate has a fairly complex aroma with some quite fruity high notes sitting above a robust bottom end in the mouth the initial fruity acidity gives way to richer quite bold cacao flavours mingling with a slight sweetness it doesnt melt quickly and has a slightly coarser mouthfeel than say a swiss chocolate but its not heavy or cloying in any way just perhaps a little less refinedalthough the cacao content is only  it has a depth and robustness of flavour more characteristic of chocolate with higher percentages  not a bad thing in my book but maybe not to everyones tastes comments are closed
this little box of goodies was thrust into my hand before i had a chance to argue so its only fair i say a few words about them before they all disappearhope and greenwoods logo has the motto purveyors of splendid confectionery so as you might expect these milk and white chocolates are aimed squarely at those with a sweeter toothas you can see they do look quite appealing though the packaging is simple but elegant and most importantly of all the chocolates are arranged in an efficient geometric patterni tried the milk champagne first and was pleasantly surprised the shell was thick and the filling was smooth if a little firm with just a hint of champagne there wasnt a lot of depth to the chocolate just the gentle warmth of marc de champagne and a lot of sweetnessat the other end of the spectrum the white champagne is dusted in icing sugar just in case you think white chocolate with a white chocolate filling isnt quite sweet enough the champagne flavour was a bit more subtle this time and it was just a little too sweet for my tastesbut im not target market here and those that like their chocolate to be sweet will love these even with my preference for dark chocolate i still managed to scoff nearly half the boxfor those with the sweeter tooth theyd make a great gift and something a bit different from the mass produced chocolate thats starting to fill the supermarket shelves this time of yearits grthese are really not good at all  give me booja booja any day  h  g have not helped make easter a special occasion
ive happily eaten my way through haighs products and even sent them overseas as a specialty present that youd never be able to buy anywhere else haighs dont have an online shop and dont export they sell their product through their own retail outlets and dont even supply wholesalesomewhat unusually for modern times haighs has been going since  is still a family owned company and is run by the th generation descendants of the founder keeping any family company together for more than  generations is a huge accomplishment this family seems to have pulled it offso reporting on haighs feels a bit like a childhood taunt nyah nyah  ive got a secret im not going to tell you and you cant find out unless you come to australia and go into one of their retail stores they also have such a large lineup that any store visit is daunting  where on earth does one startso  one starts with something simple in this case a dark chocolate couveture the reasoning is simple id expect this to be used in their other products so if its good then everything else stands a decent chance oh and i received it as a gift so why the heck not try itas you can see the packaging is very plain  just a printed cellophane and the presentation is simple  entirely appropriate for a couverture which is expected to be used in making other productsbut it all comes down to taste and the only way to taste this is to break a piece off pop it in the mouth and let it melt this reveals gradually opening flavours a slow melt a hint of vanilla and an aftertaste that lingers very nicely theres no grittiness in the texture at all
if you break a chunk off the filling has a similar colour and consistency to a brownie but on the tongue its deliciously smooth and creamy with a strong alcohol hit of course theres no artificial whisky flavouring here  in fact its made with a whopping  real scotch whisky its perfectly matched with the  dark chocolatetheres not enough of the chocolate to get a strong sense of flavour on its own but when combined with the whisky filling you end up with something thats chocolatey warming and incredibly addictive i had to physically restrain myself from eating the whole bar in one goi have no idea if true whisky aficionados will like this i suspect there are those who would not take kindly to it being combined with chocolate just as there are those who dont think chocolate should be combined with other flavours for the rest of us this is the perfect warming chocolate treat for a cold winters eveningdid you get to try the ginger and carrot one i strangely liked thatoh no i didnt i wanted to try the orange marzipan but that was one of the few they didnt havedefinitely not for me that one the majority of the displays were unfortunately dummies but i took home a couple of prizes as wellall the stock was hidden away  they had pretty much everything except orange marzipanand drinking chocolateits yummy but im also a chocoholic i love love love this bar if they sold this at the corner store for less than  a bar id probably eat one a week unfortunately i havent been able to find it in the states
inside the box theres a cellophane bag with the chocolates loose inside mine had one each of the earl grey and passion fruit and a pair of banana caramels and nutmeg  cinnamon the banana caramel was the most obvious a thick milk chocolate shell with a really gooey liquid caramel centre and a hint of banana the caramel was excellent  so much so that i could happily have forgone the banana element which also seemed to have a hint of passion fruit about itthe dark chocolate passion fruit truffle was well balanced the fruit flavour sat nicely underneath the smooth creamy filling and the shell was thick enough to mean that once the centre had melted away there was enough of it left for a long dark chocolate finishi found the lemon sugar and earl grey truffle a bit lacking in earl grey flavour the lemon sugar was a good introductory flavour with the citrus sweetness working well with the milk chocolate but there just wasnt enough of a bergamot kick in there to really justify the namethe nutmeg and cinnamon truffle is dusted in cocoa powder which gives the first taste a nice dark acidic note before the softer shell and filling come into play again the flavours are quite subtle  a hint of cinnamon and an undercurrent of spiceof the four truffles the banana caramel exhibits the strongest flavours which didnt come as too much of a surprise given my previous bananachooclate experiences the caramel is extremely runny so much so that when i bit into it i had to pop the whole thing into my mouth in order to avoid covering myself in carameloverall id say that these truffles err on the side of caution the flavours are generally quite subtle and i couldnt help but think that having them in a bag together resulted in the flavours mingling a little the web site has the full range of chocolates as well as chocolate raisins and ginger with the added bonus of a mail order facility and  of your money goes to the born free foundation which cant be a bad thing at allfunny how truffles derived its name from fungus because of its dirty look when it looks like a piece of heaven to me you can even make your own truffles 
casey doesnt much like having a photo taken  hes the shy retiring sort but when it comes to talking about chocolate and comparing what works and what does not  hes happy to have  chat perhaps even more interesting he has a stash of competitor products when i introduced myself as that reviewer he was only too happy to drag them out and say what do you think of this  well when not trying his own productsthe chocolate used in his product range is callebaut which he points out is used for about  of all the australian chocolate products using belgian chocolate and there is variation in callebaut around the world because it comes from different production sites casey thinks the different sugars used have an effect on flavour and this would not surprise me at all a little digging shows that belgian chocolate actually means belgian craftsmanship  the production site need not be in belgiumand that packaging well it might be simple but this clearly has not stopped the business expanding nor was it the slightest deterrent to the crowd around the stall in the market on a saturday morning as one gentlemen explained im here every saturday to stock up i cant get enough a ringing endorsement if ever there was oneas it was i dragged casey away from paying customers for way too long but i learned a lot enjoyed the discussion and came away with a wonderful haulso heres a selection of three  with three more to follow another daylimoneas the label says slow cooked lemon slices in a  dark chocolateeach bitesize piece contains a generous slice of lemon which is luscious juicy and has that special flavour which comes from cooking a whole lemon the chocolate and lemon complement each other well theres a nice balance the lemon is still soft and has a flavour that lingers long after youve finished eating a pieceif you like chocolate and lemon youll love thisbean rushthis came as something of a surprise i was expecting whole chocolate coated coffee beans  much like you can buy elsewhere this is not like that at all its more of a slab that has been broken up with coarsely ground coffee beans inopening the pack lets out a huge whiff of coffee and my first reaction was wow and the tasting didnt disappoint either using a ground coffee bean gets the flavour all through the chocolate so instead of the whole bean that you crunch up to get a face full of grit this has the small pieces of coffee bean through giving a much better flavour combinationi can see ill have trouble stopping myself from scoffing this downcranberry clumpscranberries are one of those strange things that has suddenly appeared on the scene in australia  but  or  years ago wed never heard of them i still dont really know what a fresh one tastes like we only ever seem to come across cranberry juice  and that seems to be imported from the usaso i had no idea what to expect of these the cranberries seem to be dried but nevertheless biting onto one has a curious crunch and whack of berry flavour and of course chocolate i think i still dont really know what a cranberry is like but ill happily eat a stack of these little beautiesfor the cranberries i dont really know of anyone who eats them fresh  i suppose you can but outside of juice they are most often found dried they are great in cookies or made into some form of the eponymous cranberry dressing or sauce used for alongside roasted turkeychicken around the holidays
i think its fair to say that over the past few years the chocablog team have discovered just how varied chocolate makers products are and between us weve sampled some quite unusual tasting chocolate this bar doesnt contain any pieces of dried mango or pieces of anything for that matter the flavour is in the chocolate itself which is a little different to my previous fruitchilli tasting experiences when you open the package asnd have a sniff the fruity aroma is right there with a dark cocoa undertone popping a square into my mouth i immediately noticed the flavour of the fruit but the instant the chocolate became warm the chilli began to make itself known to my taste buds its a slow spreading warmth mingling with the fruit flavour and the dark bittersweet undercurrents of the ecuadorean cocoa a second square merely amplified the original experience fruit bursting up onto the palate followed by intermingled cocoa and chilli notes  a soft mouthfeel and a long finish with the cocoa managing to hang in with the fruit flavours to the end the balance of flavours is excellent  you can taste everything youre supposed to and the chilli never masks the fruit or cocoa flavours at the finish theres still a fruity element mingling with the warmth of the chilli as the cocoa flavours die awayits unusual without falling into the wacky chocolate category interesting enough to mean i would probably buy it again if i saw it although im not sure id pay uk import prices again and of sufficiently high quality to merit a recommendation curious palates would definitely enjoy thisdidnt like this bar too much when l tasted it some time agomust have been the mango aromatoo strong or l dont like mango muchbut their  pure cocoa bar is amazing
the packaging is standard handmade fare by description clear bag sticker labels on front and back and ties to hold the bag shut but it isnt standard there is a plethora of ties in blue and white gauze and raffia instead of just one ribbon as i untied all of them which contrary to what youd imagine isnt difficult i couldnt figure out what combination of slips and folds and knots was used maybe its a trade secret in any case it shows care and devotioni think you could eat this toffee all day long with proper gaps to savor between pieces of course its that gentle in making a generous impact im just left curious by the ingredients butter chocolate sugar pecans corn syrup vanilla and special ingredients special ingredients is that another trade secret does it matter when the final product tastes goodsalecom is giving away a box of vosges trufflesoi gostaria de saber si as balas toffee sao de voceis si for gostaria de saber si ou nao poke encomtrei enporesa dentro de  bala
the other day this pretty little gold box arrived in the mail no explanation no branding no covering letter just a gold box with a label saying try me now being the kind of person that will always eat unidentified food thats been sent in the post i couldnt resist opening itwho was it from hotel chocolat thorntons as it turns out it was kelloggs i assume its meant to be some kind of joke a cereal bar neatly divided into squares and presented in a pretty chocolate box along with a card saying look out for more information soonsure enough the following day the real thing arrived each bar is substantial enough to be satisfying chewy oaty and most importantly chocolatey you cant really tell from the photo but most of the base is solid chocolateboth varieties are chocolatey enough to be satisfying and you can actually taste the difference between the milk and dark varieties theres no cocoa percentage listed on the packaging but both bars contain over  chocolate by weight thats not bad for a healthy cereal bar my main issue with them was that theyre just a bit too moreish and had to eat four at once oh wellfor breakfast on the go or a tasty afternoon snack theyre really pretty good just dont chop them up and pretend theyre expensive chocolates that would be sillyat just  kcla per bar i think that might be a wonderful midmorning snacka fiber bar that tastes that good  definitely worth a trytrying to find these everywhere none in my local tesco or asda may have to lay on the floor and have a screaming paddy gwould love to sample this product fibre plusthanksthis product is fab i have purchased in my local asda it was on special offer for  a packet of  but now it is  for  still worth it very satisfying i used to have a mars bar in my packing up for when i was hiking now i take the fibre plus bar less calories and less weight watcher points great
im having one of those days trying to write software that runs on different versions of windows  and ive hit a stumbling block in vista as it seems one does the chinese curse applies doubly so to windows vista may you live in very interesting timesit was a welcome diversion then to head out to the local foodland supermarket to stock up on a few things weve run out of its been a while since i checked out their oddball chocolate section which sadly seems to have less variety than it used to i was however pleasantly surprised to find this vivani pralinanyhow this one the chocolate is milk based  with  minimum cocoa solids and  minimum milk solids actually  cocoa is doing a lot better than some of the milk chocolate we get around here the filling is the hazelnut nougatthe chocolate is quite soft their web site recommends eating it straight from the fridge  something i did not do and very very creamy eating it and letting the chocolate melt away its hard to tell where the chocolate outer ends and the nougat begins  then gradually the hazelnut flavour begins the nougat is soft creamy hazelnutty and generally very yummythere are two aspect that are not quite so wonderful  the first is the price at over  for a  gram block this really is a luxury indulgence the other this is very sweet if you like your chocolate sweet youll swoon over this one if like me you prefer a bit less sweetness then youll like it but might struggle to scoff the entire block in a single sittingdont get me wrong though this is good very good im impressed and with milk chocolate it takes a lot to impress me and some of the others in the product range look very interesting indeed i might have to see if i can track down a local supplier who carries more of the product rangei like this brand they use quality ingredients all of which are organically sourced whats nice too is you can often find vivani chocolate in better supermarkets and grocery stores i just saw they added dark chocolate with matcha and mango to their product range  i will definitely have to try that nexti havent tried this one but if you see the dark chocolate with caramel pieces snap it up its like the lindt crunchy caramel excellence only a squillion times better because its dark interestingi was just rubbing in front of vivani chocolates in our market after a long time today but then picked gb with peppermint oil insteadl like their  dark bar with orange flavor since l dont buy milk chocolate and l hope some dark soul here will review that one soonsimoni love vivani  it is smooth and rich and not bitter i like it better than the i have a hard time finding different flavors in the boston area but when i went to berlin last fall i tried white chocolate crisp and several other yummy flavorsi just love the quality of vivani  especially due to the fact that virtually all of their chocolates are soy free and dont use emulsifiers  im allergic to soy as well as coeliac so these have been a huge find for me  i really like the fact that at least someone around here still uses pure cocoa butter as soy was never meant to be in chocolate yet finding a chocolate without derived ingredients is so hard  i cook all the time with their milk chocolate when making cakes and layering our traditional british toffees and people keep telling me how much they love it  their praline is to die for  ive always had a slightly sweet tooth so these are great  d  their dark varieties arent too bad eitherthanks for starting a great discussion
la boite ronde the round box is home to a wide variety of shapes and flavours with a menu covering over forty items a possible content of thirty two and the likelihood that you may also get something that isnt on the menu as i seemed to have mystery items aside first impressions are good gallers trademark burnt orange looks good and the choice of a lightly corrugated feeling card for the box gives it a good texture the double ribbon is a neat touch as well the box also has a weighty feel to it there are g of chocolates in there and it feels like ittheres something mildly eccentric about the fact that the chocolates vary in size as well as shape and i found it quite pleasing to the eye the nonuniformity of presentation was strangely appealing with the chocolates seemingly randomly distributed through the two layers  some of the size differences were interesting as well the smallest of the white chocolates was positively dwarfed by the biggest milk and dark chocolate squares making sharing an even more difficult business i supposetheres certainly something to suit every chocolate lover from rich nutty pralines to smooth gooey caramels a smattering of floral flavours a coffee ganache or a dark bittersweet marzipan treat standouts are the caramels and the florales naturally but the whole collection is classic belgian chocolate there are a couple of repeat flavours but in the main you tend to get one of almost anything making this a rather interesting gift and a real pain when it comes to sharing because you tend to want to try everything for yourselfthese chocolates are very much as you would expect  very well made belgian classics theyre a fairly safe bet in that there arent any challenging flavours no chilli curry tree by products or anything remotely odd at all every one a tried and trusted favourite unless youve never tried a rose jasmine or orange cream and very one a prime example of its type i thought the inclusion of three of the florales might be considered a bit much  after all there are four ranges in the elements set  but there again if the florales are the most popular with female customers why not include three of them here i suppose we could argue that one foreverat over twenty five pounds this isnt a cheap gift but its decidedly elegant the chocolate equivalent of a hand finished valentines card methinks and definitely something to consider for the more sophisticated recipient of your affectionscomments are closed
the pink and gold box didnt promise me much but i had a change of heart on pulling out the chocolate sphere wrapped in shiny red foil it looks as tempting as snow whites apple ferrara tells you to burst then enjoy but like terrys the pieces dont come apart with ease i gave up after a few whacks not wanting the neighbors to think i was mad and still only found less than half of the pieces broken off a coaxing knife of fingernail breaks the rest off still id hardly think banging chocolate on the counter is romanticafter opening up the orangeballapple i had it sitting at my desk for a while through which i found that it has a very appealing aroma not all fresh strawberries but not too artificial either the pieces all have one of ten prints on them like a rose cupid and an only you heart not the most classylooking designs but they are details going along with my better than id expected comments is the taste same strawberry set with milk chocolate which id put a bit above average you do need some sort of a sweet tooth but the effect isnt sicklysweet instead its a yummy treatthis isnt the sort of valentines gift to make a statement yet it has enough of a market maybe in a group of presents for someone who wouldnt want to be tempted by too much chocolate or for a younger couple im certainly glad it found its way to melooks like it would be a fun change of pacei saw these in a local store this past week and i just couldnt bring myself to try it im a chocolate orange kind of girl and i didnt particularly like it when they started making variations of thatthat said it does look pretty tastyi bought two of this strawberry ball and i gave it to my parents as a present for valentines day they were amazed by the aroma and the shape thing of this kind of chocolate the taste too were goodit only needs two whacks one on each pole and these poles are flatter than the rest of the orange so you know where to hit them give it those two good whacks on a good solid surface like a hard wood that has no give or stone do not try to use your hand and it will be properly separated
the fruit takes the form of tiny freeze dried pieces embedded through the bar lots and lots of them and all that fruit certainly gives this bar something unique because the overwhelming flavour is that of strawberry milkshake a really good strawberry milkshake at thatthe white chocolate is sweet of course but not too sweet and the fruit is the dominant flavour those tiny pieces become more intense as they melt in the mouth which just make the whole thing extremely moreishbut those tiny fruit pieces are also give the bar an interesting crunchy texture just occasionally though theres a little piece thats too hard which is really the only thing that spoils this bar feeling like youve broken a tooth on a strawberry isnt much funthat aside this is one of the nicest white chocolates ive had in a long time  a fact that has more to do with the fruit and the chocolatewho cares about fancy lingonberries  blackberries why dont more chocolates include those im not hugely into white chocolate either except askinosie or vestris pistachio bar but this looks like its worth a shotto be honest though in this one the overriding flavour is strawberry milkshake rather than blackberry giggles those are the bars that i sent kath thats me hannah i dont know why i find this so amusing but i donow i want to make a blackberry milkshakei think that just shows im either stupid or forgetful  probably both either way i want a blackberry milkshake too now i love white chocolate and am always finding so few options when it comes to getting adventurous with white chocolate mostly i find dark chocolate and milk chocolate comes in a close second but i really wish that there were more white chocolate variations out there for white chocolate lovers like me this one looks like its definitely worth it though berries  white chocolate and im sure ill be in heavenoh my white chocolate and berries  sounds wonderful  ive been on a real berry kick latelyi would love to try this chocolate bari usually see fruit flavored white chocolate bars with japanese confectionery really hoping this trend might catch up in the us  in the meantime ill be purchasing these bars via the web  really glad to have found a site that ships domestically within the ushttpwwwmostlychocolatecomstoremainaspxpitemdetailitembuone of my colleauges went abroad and brought this for me ive tried it and trust me its amazing now that its finished im looking at departmental stores to buy one  addicted to it these days highly recommended
before we continue with this i feel i ought to pout this particular item into perspectiveit reminded me of an occasion in my youith when my girlfriend at the time told me she only wanted a card for her birthday so i went out and bought one of those oversized metresquare greetings cards its larger than life ridiculously over the top and possibly more than one person should be givenas you can see using the new chocablog p piece standard measurement its a fairly hefty slab of dark fruit and nut chocolate hotel chocolats  cocoa house blend combined with raisins hazelnuts pecan and cherries or should i say the thrilling crunch of hazelnuts and pecans as well as the succulence of raisins and the thrill of cherry pieces hmm  im not sure ive ever been thrilled by fruit and nuts and isnt the use of thrill and thrilling in the same sentence a little lazythis lacks the intricacy of the fruity affair heart and the black and red packaging and nononsense seal suggest that this is possibly aimed at the male recipient none of your girly pink chocolate here oh noas for the chocolate itself well its a very well made absolutely enormous bar of posh fruit and nut youll either love it or you wont the chocolate is as one might expect excellent and the nuts are crisp and full of flavour the cherries add a little zing and chewiness to the overall taste experience making it probably one of the best fruit and nut combinations ive had in a long time the packaging is luxurious with rich deep colours and a very subtle rose motif that shouldnt offend the more macho among us it also has a decent shelf life meaning that it will probably keep you going until easter at almost  it is something of a grand gesture but i reckon its better value than a fistful of roses and will certainly provide more pleasurei think i actually like this blackred packaging more than pinkfrilly ones it looks    serious and the stamp gives it a classic feel and i love the hummingbirds
the milk chocolate is a rich  venezuelan and the honeycombe is made from real dorset honeythe other thing i like about it is that at cm thick its easy enough to break of small chunks to nibble on with the hotel chocolat hearts you need a full set of industrial power tools to break off even a bitesize chunk and at under half the size its not quite as overwhelming to look at eitherif youre going for all out shock and awe this valentines day then you probably want to go for one of the hotel chocolat offerings this is a little more of a  restrained thoughtful and stylish gift and im told that some women appreciate thati wouldnt knowlol dom id take thin and easily breakable over trying to bite in to something that resembles a tobleroneyou know how those pyramids always end up going up your nose ive been looking for a nice milk chocolate today too ill have to look up chococo they sound like a pretty chocoloving couple
being the generous soul that i am i shall take them to work this week and see how they go down expect a report in the comments on this reviewi love chilli and nibs so might have to pick this one up theres actually a hotel chocolat store right near where im staying though today i focused on thorntons and some of their square barsi have never had chili in chocolate while i absolutely adore my chocolate ive never been a fan of spicy foods that said i would still give this one a try just to say ive tried it ive heard so many good reviews about chili being combined with good quality chocolate itd be a shame not to give it a chance
ok i have to come clean im a sucker for licorice strange thing is the rest of the family hate it with a vengeance which of course means more for me boo hoowhen i was a kid licorice came in two kinds as a long rope about a metre of it bought from the school canteen and guaranteed to leave you bloated and black of tongue for the rest of the day the other way was chocolate bullets  milk choc coated little pieces about an inch long bought from the local deli for one cent eachand at this point i must digress in australia as in the rest of the world regional differences determine the term for the convenience store here in south australia its a deli  which is short for delicatessen  a place for buying lollies tissues the things you ran out of and where truckies stop for sandwiches and sticky buns at lunch time the place thats open for extended hours in eastern australia they are called milk bars go figure in the rest of the world its the minimart the eleven and so onwhen i was a kid we would take  cents of pocket money and go pick from the lolly counter  a few of those at two for a cent a few of those at one cent each the  cents each stuff was way extravagant you never got your moneys worth from those twenty cents was enough to ensure a sugar high lasting a whole day and feeling slightly sick for much of that time as wellwhen i were a lad chocolate bullets featured high on the list they were cheap and chocolate and licorice what more could anybody ask forimagine my surprise then when the lady of the house came home with ricci dark chocolate coated licorice maybe she likes me after all nobody else in the house will touch it ive never heard of the manufacturer ricci remond chocolate co  but they are australian and from what i can find seem to have been around for some time they have no web site so its hard to find more about themanyhow  the licoricethe picture does not quite do justice to the sheer size of these pieces they are huge  about  cm  inches long and the thickness of my little finger the chocolate bullets of my youth were mere babies compared to these as you can also see  there have been no glazing agents used and being packed in a plain bag they are quite discoloured from being knocked about no matter its the taste that countsand here i have to declare that the chocolate is a bit of a disappointment there is plenty of it but for being dark it is only  and the licorice flavour tends to dominate the licorice though is good very nice not too sweet and not too black i could make myself seriously ill on thesegiven that im the only one in the house that will eat these i can see that the huge  g pack is going to last me a long timehow do i buy ricci chocolate licoricewe bought these in a supermarket in australia try woolworths or look up ricci remond chocolate co in the sydney phone book and give them a call they have no web site that i could findi cant relate at all to the licorice aspect of this review being firmly in the no thanks court myself but oh the days of picking and choosing lollies from the local milk barpetrol stationwherever for me it was more like c each and i remember being partial to cobberscue little kids voice after dumping a pile of coins on the counter what can i get for thiiiiis muchwhere can i buy ricci licorice without the chocolate it is only in australiaas far as i know  only in australiai have been eating these for a long time and all of a sudden they have disappeared from the shelves oct  please when will i be able to buy them againits available here in kuala lumpur malaysia just bought them from cold storage theyre having aussie food product fare and riccis licorice is a best buyricci is a branding name under which darrell lea chocolates sell their products to newsagancies pharmacies and export markets theyre all made in sydney darrell lea factory so its just a different packaging otherwise theproduct is the samethey look just like what we bought in tasmania at coles  they are wonderful how do you get more in the usyou might be able to order them online from darrell lea which own the ricci namethese are the best though trying them before reading your blog i would tend to disagree i know that the dark chocolate isnt even  but it still compiments the liquorice in a positive way increasing the overall quality and taste but im not saying i dont like plain liquorice but i do like chocolate go aussie chocolate industryi and my family really enjoy this dark chocolate  coated  licorice  our local iga doesnt stock it now  i live in heathridge western australia  can you tell where i can  buy it near here please love the dark chocolate coated licorice  where can i buy it around heathridge western australia please thank you  norman
its not every day that you get a delivery from mars so i was quite looking forward to seeing what was inside the martian jiffy bag that arrived on my doorstep what we have is four varieties of hot chocolate based on familiar mars brands each in their own cup and ready to drink once youve microwaved them for  seconds that isive never had one of these  or any of mars drinks range  and to be honest i was sceptical from the beginning do i really want a mars bar flavoured drink and wouldnt it be easier more efficient and more environmentally friendly to distribute them in packet form and have you add your own milkthose concerns aside i decided to try a couple removing the lid of the plastic cup the first thing you notice is just how thick these things are in their unheated state theyre practically solidi tried the galaxy variety first after having followed the instructions to the letter the first thing i did was scald my mouth even after leaving the drink for a few minutes it was still piping hot while the cup itself stayed deceptively cool i sat and watched the little marshmallows melt away to almost nothing before it had cooled enough to drink perhaps i just have an ber powerful microwavethe galaxy flavour was noticeable though and although it lost most of that thickness in the heating process it was still quite creamythe other varieties all taste pretty much how youd expect and come complete with marshmallows maltesers or tiny mars bars to float or dunk in your drink they all have their own flavours which do actually resemble what it says on the packaging but the main thing they have in common is that sweetness which begins to get a bit sickly toward the end of the cupthose with an extra sweet tooth will probably love them i suspect youd keep a stash of them in the office kitchen or the cupboard at home for a warm chocolatey sugar rush old a cold day when you just cant be bothered to make a real hot chocolate they do have those little plastic lids with small drinking hole so you can make them at home then spill them all over people on the tube if you like too theyre not really my thing though and i certainly wouldnt give one to my valentinei can sense the sickly sweetness from here very brave of you to taste them all in one session you may need a cholesterol testi didnt taste them all in one session it took a number of daysseems a bit mean to market something to single women as the perfect valentines day companion though i guess if they are sickly and sweet they may well behii know this is an old post but i wondered if you knew if these had been discontinued i used to like getting one occasionally and cant seem to find them anymore in particular i liked the moment du chocolatthanksi was just wondering where can you get them sounds sweet 
i picked the smaller of the two logoemblazoned pink boxes which had four chocolates each apparently being the favourite of the four main characters in the show there is also a larger hatboxshaped box which combines these signature chocolates with various truffles but my budget couldnt stretch that far because these are really rather expensive the small box comes in at just over ten dollars and considering that is only for four chocolates they had better be some pretty memorable chocolates the whole thing is nicely packaged with a very substantial box which is barely halffilled by the plastic tray that holds the four chocolates the actual chocolates continue the theme with appropriate designs like a cityscape leopard print and of course shoes so it does well in the looks department at least but lets move onto the feature presentation  the chocolates carries favourite is a milk chocolate cosmopolitan and it really is disappointing the flavour is hardly there at all and the thick creamy filing just disappears amidst the milk chocolate most people would be hard pressed to recognise this as a cosmopolitan especially fans of the cocktail mirandas favourite is a big improvement it is a dark chocolate caramel almond with a runny caramel centre that comes somewhere between marzipan and amaretto on the taste spectrum definitely the most interesting of the foursome samanthas favourite a milk chocolate champagne is not significantly different from carries with a thick sweet cream that at least has a champagnelike taste the sweetness is almost too much though and it isnt something i feel the urge to eat again and again and finally theres charlottes favourite a dark chocolate lemon raspberry the filling is rich and definitely finds a good balance between the two flavours but when combined with the dark chocolate shell it gets a little lost because that initial burst of sharpness fades away too quickly close but not quite worth the money definitely not this really is a case of style over substance making it the perfect gift for valentines day i guess im just a romantic at heartcomments are closed

this time i bought a box of three versatile little chocolate tortes eat hot or cold says the box i was told that chilled theyre smooth meltinthemouth and deeply satisfying only with far more es than im prepared to type warm one up and its merely mouthwateringly rich and moreish naturally as i had three i was free to try one each way and have the third in my preferred style resultslide one out of the box and tyou have a rather unassuming little pudmy eye was drawn to the dimpled top  ideal for a blob of cream or ice cream or maybe for filling with your favourite liqueuras i said theyre not the biggest puds in the world  take a lookbut what they are is dense very dense cutting into one revealed a dark sticky interior theyre made with a quarter chocolate and that chocolate is  cocoa so theyre not slacking on the chocolate content when i bit into it i immediately thought better of chewing its very rich very gooey and very chocolatey with an underlying sweetness bear in mind that half of this little pud is made up of sugar and chocolateheated up as directed and its a different story theyre designed to be microwaved so that the outside keeps its shape while the inside melts and thats exactly what happens topped with a big blob of vanilla ice cream theyre a deceptively filling dessert heating releases the aroma as well delivering a much more satisfying experience in sensory terms a dash of coffee liqueur i used patron xo caf but other coffee drinks are available and a blob of cream transformed it into a little gourmet treati can imagine a number of variations one could put together using these little chocolate tortes and they have enough in the way of rich chocolate flavours to accommodate the odd experimental addition im getting to quite like some of gs desserts and this shows that they can do more than produce a decent chocolate moussewow they really are tinysuggested portion size  five pudsyum those look deliciousthey are a huge rip off honestly not worth itim arriving in london on tuesday first visit ever and im thinking this may be just the thing to alleviate the trials of jetlag p at least until i can get some rococo chocolatethe texture looks so rich i can almost taste it they look deliciousive had these theyre so yummy i want some now 
this is a  milk chocolate with small pieces of butterscotch embedded throughout the bar personally i wouldnt call it butterscotch its more of a hard caramel like crushed up werthers originals the bar itself is divided into large flat squares and as you can see this particular bar arrived a little the worse for wear coincidentally this is pretty much how it looks in the picture on the wrapper toonot the prettiest looking bars perhaps but as it turns out its quite pleasant bite into a square and the first thing you notice is the satisfying crunch from all the little butterscotch pieces although barely noticeable when looking at    the chocolate it turns out those little pieces are just the right size to give you that crunchinessthe chocolate is smooth and creamy and although not as rich as some of the higher percentage milk chocolates ive had recently its rather nice i could easily demolish a whole bar without thinking about itthe butterscotch pieces dont add quite as much flavour as id like but what there is is nice enough a little more smoky caramelly buttercotchyness wouldnt have gone amiss thoughthis is a really nice chocolate to enjoy with a cup of tea its not a luxury product but falls squarely into the well above average categoryis this at all akin to green and blacks butterscothtoffee bar every time i try that one i think yum at first then it gets too crazysweet
hence all the labels and logos on the container usda organic dairyfree sugarfree kosher and no whey or rice fillers it can all be a little heavy if you arent asking for all these qualities but it was the cat that got more of my attention maybe im just a sucker for animals but he has that spark of naughtiness in his openmouthed smile that makes him a worthy mascot turn the container around and youll find the brief ingredients list organic erythritol organic cocoa organic maltodextrin organic guar gum erythritol is the naturallyoccurring sweetener used in place of sugarpeeling off the lid the mix is a rough powder with little sugarlookalike crystals it smells something like ovaltine if my memory serves correctly a sweeter cocoa powder smell the directions instruct one tablespoon per cup making  servings i filled my mug to what i guessed was about a cup but the tablespoon didnt seem enough so being too lazy to get a second spoon i just poured a little more mix in and then i chided my laziness when too much powder fell into the cup worried that i had ruined my tasting yet i had no reason to fear being prone to add extra mix to my hot chocolate this excess ended up the right amount the mix has a tendency to clump up as you stir it in yet a small layer of welcoming foam forms on top after its all mixed the taste is creamy light on chocolate this is the mildflavored one though there are also dark versions the erythritol gives it to me a slight odd smell and taste but its preferable to stevia not so strong as that this chocolate feels good to drink in the end no sugarsweet rush no chocolate overkill if thats something you avoidso it works a standard hot chocolate that will meet your notsostandard needs or wants with at least one of those numerous labelshmm as a lactoseintolerant chocolate lover im glad that this is out there as an option but id still rather some pralus  does this company still exist can you please tell me where can i find this mix my son is a type  diabetic  his best friend has a severe dairy allergy so this is perfect for me thanks 
even from the outside it looks like a special bar of chocolate their futuristic spacefoodesque packaging is rather appealing not to mention it does make sure that the contents are fresh too and once it is torn open the rich rich aroma comes flooding out in an almost overwhelming way a good time to pause and consider if you really want to do this my nose says yesthe bar might be a little on the small side at a mere  grams but this isnt the kind of chocolate that you wolf down it has a nice high gloss and when snapped it breaks cleanly without much crumbling suggesting that this isnt going to be overly dry like some high percentage bars in fact it is a remarkably smooth and satisfying chocolate that doesnt quite hide its pedigree but doesnt scream  either soma use four different types of beans from papua new guinea ghana madagascar and ecuador and that is reflected in the complexity of the flavour it starts off not surprisingly with a rush of bitterness that doesnt last nearly as long as expected instead it changes into a second wave of burnt fruitiness with warm leathery undertones that continue to shift in surprisingly subtle ways and those almost constant shifts are what will keep you coming back for nibble after nibble until the whole bar is gone eating a  bar really shouldnt be this easy and now its all gone and i find myself still wanting more signifying that this is an extraordinary bar of chocolate if you are feel the need to experiment with the darkest and purest of chocolate you should search some arcana  out because you will not be disappointedive recently started to crave darker and darker chocolate and woudl dearly love to try this sometime so far ive only had two  experiences and they were polar opposites dagobas prima materia was awful and pretty much had no taste to me whereas pralus  was heavenly heavenly i never would have guesssed it was   you should definitely try to track it down im going to be nervous about eating another  bar after this because this stuff is so good and id be worried about anything else shaping upembarrassed face that is indeed the one i feel ashamed because ive read all your archives whoops so good though oh my i want it the  is intimidating like you said because you can so easily not connect with it but if you do like with pralus     well thats the whole reason i eat chocolate just amazingi have a bar of this in my kitchen right now for emergencies  i live in scotland but a compassionate canadian friend ships it to me when i run out  it really is incredible stuff and so smooth and easy to nibble that you really wouldnt immediately peg it as a  bar  delicious stuff
coming in a bag both basic and bland the quality of these caramels is nothing sensational nothing worth particular note except when you put one in your mouth you fight away your criticism the chocolate caramel is stiff very stiff and the chocolate coating melts quickly yet in this case these two facts turn out to be positives the chocolate is less than satisfactory so who would want to taste more of it anyway stiff caramel means it lingers slowly softening allowing you to alternate between sucking on it as with a hard candy and lightly chewing it as with a gum my personal beliefs tell me this is the only way to eat a riesen a single one can last so long like thisi dont know what it is about these but i love them i know that theyre not ultimate quality but theyre consistent and the chew is really smooth and has a great cocoa flavorriesen are the best sweet full stop
the three most obvious flavours are the pralines noir at  cocoa a milk and a creamy white chocolate each in itself a fine example and really the only matter is personal preference i enjoyed the milk disliked the white and preferred the dark no surprises there thenthe caf ligeois turned out to be a dark chocolate exterior which was home to a mild and very light coffee mousse filling the filling worked as a great counterpoint to the bittersweetness of the chocolatei could almost have taken a dislike to the noix de coco on sight a white chocolate shell and coconut filling  hardly my cup of tea now however i was pleasantly surprised by a dark filling housing toasted coconut which was never too sweet the rich cocoa flavours were enough to balance the sweetness and the flavours of the toasted coconut were natural and refreshingly brightanother white exteriordark interior pairing which turned out to be a surprise winner was the manon it was sweeter than the coconut version and the filling was very busy with fruit and nut pieces held in a coffee flavoured centre something i could see working with a good strong coffeeso just who are these chocolates aimed at i can only imagine groups of women on the continent having friends over in the late morning for proper authentic coffee served in small cups each accompanied by one of these mini bars balanced on the saucer in place of the more usual brown biscuit similarly i might consider using these to serve with coffee at the end of a meal theyve clearly been created to have with a coffee the question is will customers get into the habit of having the odd naughty belgian chocolate treat with their mid morning pickmeup these are still quite pricey chocolates at around p per piece and as such they strike me as being the preserve of the wealthier chocolate lover or as an indulgence or gift for the coffee drinker in your life theyd certainly make a change from socks for dad and why shouldnt men get chocolate gifts as wellinteresting fact  on valentines day in japan women give men chocolate or flowers so im reliably informed a month later its the turn of the men to give gifts to the womeni support this japanese tradition and think everyone should give me chocolate not flowers on valentines day and i promise to do the same a month later really i dothe manon does sound interesting fruit nut and coffee i must admit ive seent hese around but never felt that they look quite exciting enough to justify the cost id rather just get some michel cluizel even if this does end up being even more expensive p
unlace the box and open the doors to reveal the beating heart insidelast year my heart was broken when it arrived but this year it turned up completely intact i can only assume the delivery guy who smashed my heart in a jealous fit of rage last year has been fired shame but the fact is the only way to eat something like this is to smash it anyway not that i mind  it all ends up broken in my tummy anywaythe milk chocolate is  cocoa solids and is as smooth and creamy and delicious as youd expect from hotel chocolat the fruitness comes from swirls of  white chocolate flavoured with strawberry raspberry and blackcurrent  each bite tastes slightly different as you get different quantities of the swirls with every mouthful those swirls are quite sweet and tangy but they only go down a couple of millimetres so the overall experience is quite subtle the decorative balls are fruit and white chocolate shells filled with praline and while theyre impossible to remove from the chocolate id be quite happy with a bag of them on their own the fruit and nutty praline make an excellent combinationof course theres another surprise when you turn the heart over not only is there a beautifully embossed design but its pressed with tiny beads of caramelised puffed rise this gives parts of the chocolate a nice crunchy texture but im not entirely convinced by it because most of them fall out and end up all over the you and the floor the moment you lift it up perhaps hotel chocolat just want you to get a bit messy with your fruity affairive said it before about hotel chocolats valentines products and ill say it again if you love a chocolate lover get them one of these i seriously doubt either of you will regret itwow im not a huge fan of fruit  chocolate combinations but that is just visually stunning and i think i could cope with a bag of those pralineesque treats too pthis heart chocolate inside was awesome the packing was great definitely a nice valentines gift probably your loved ones will be glad oflovely  how big is itits g and about  inches across
we found this rather generous  gram box of goodies some time ago and it has been sitting in the stash ever since waiting for an opportunity trouble is the stash is growing and causing household friction use up some of that chocolate so we have room for other things ok  who needs telling twicethe box says this is luscious berries  selected exotic berry flavoured fruit pieces coated in milk dark and white chocolate inside the box is a bag with a lot of little balls in  white light and dark  all slightly glossy  thats the glazing agent   whatever that isthere is no special aroma  something we really should expect with a product like this which means it must be taste test time of course i havent just done a taste test myself ive passed them around the family the universal reaction is wow followed by fruity followed by what flavour is itafter finding out the flavours i can pick the blueberry  which is subtle at the best of times like scoffing down a punnet of blueberries  so this is a pretty big achievement i really cant tell the strawberry its just fruity i think i can pick the raspberry without knowing though i really would struggle to pick thema check of the ingredients shows that the fruit stuff is apple puree dried apricots and dried apple with a mere  actual berries the chocolate blends are shown as the milk chocolate being  cocoa and the dark  not very dark really  enough to show its a different colourdont get me wrong about the downsides not much berry in spite of the name and the dark not being very dark  these are very very edible indeed the family come grazing by to vacuum up a few more each pass by and as i write this i have to keep sampling because they contain a fair amount of fruit eating the  grams in a sitting is likely to have unpleasant consequences but its tempting to tryif you put these out for a dinner party or bbq as a nibble starter desert postdesert whatever  they will go down very well indeedi absolutely hear you on the needing to eat more to buy more thats what i tell people when i start giving them chocolate and they thnk im being too generous  you have to help me eat it so i can buy more dwould probably pass on these those it takes a very special kind of fruit to work with chocolate in my mind and i dont think flavoured pieces would quite cut it for mei think that you cannot judge the chocolate on what it looks like as a saying goes that dont judge the book by its cover so though the little balls inside the luscious berries are simple to look at and their is no aroma the most important is how the taste isthank you for the postso nicely put  unpleasant consequences  and a fair warning  its easy to forget the fruit part whan its wrapped in chocolate
guest chocablogger nastash faria returns with some more south african treatsutopia in the snack aisle of my local supermarket romany creams are a chocolate coconut biscuit sandwich with chocolate in the middle these little fellows on the other hand are the reverse  instead of biscuit around some chocolate theyre chocolate around some biscuit in other words perfectthe chocolate is lovely not too much shellac and the shell is neither too thick nor too thin its just good old nomming quality milk chocolate in perfect proportion to the biscuit it covers the biscuit itself is actually what makes this perfect  the texture is not only biscuity but a little coconutty too so it crumbles perfectly when youre a black abyss into which chocolate can always be thrown like me youll find that the more of these you eat the better the tastes that exist in the biscuit part are not always immediately apparent but they do accumulate as you munch your way to obesity they are slightly salty slightly malty and have a hint of golden syrup in fact the taste is ever so slightly reminiscent of miloone of the best things about this is that the taste lingers so although i can still guarantee that you will eat the entire pack you could probably stretch it out over the course of about  hours at  grams you neednt be ashamed of yourself until you remember how little biscuits way and how filled with bad things they arei consoled myself with the fact that i didnt buy the  kg tub i take my victories where i can get themso theyre like a heavier version of maltesersill be completely honest im not confident enough to say that i like having a bakers balls in my mouthgood review
another pressie from the travelling friends this box purports to contain a flavour of singapore by way of these curious little cakes of milk chocolate which also contain roasted macadamias and crisped ricethere are eighteen pieces in total each one about eight or nine grams in weight theres no indication of coca content and the nutritional breakdown informs thew consumer that four of these little chaps will provide you with almost a quarter of your rda of fatfurther oddness surrounds their origins apparently these are made in hawaii usa and imported into the country im assuming these were purchased at an airport or somewhere similar as they have that tourist souvenir look to themat first bite theyre not too unpleasant at all the nut pieces and crispy rice work well to break up the chocolate and the chocolate isnt too sweet a second bite had me rethinking my opinion though like a lot of american produced chocolate they soon came across as being very fatty and sugary with high fructose corn syrup and malt flavouring striking me as principal culprits in the slightly sickly taste i was gettingtheyre certainly not moreish at least not to me one was enough and the second one to be sure just confirmed that what i was eating was not in any way high quality chocolate i know that i could be accused of being spoiled but the chocolate in these is probably of lower quality than your average high street chocolate bar making them something to avoid in my book ive always been wary of confectionery branded as a souvenir and these confirm whycomments are closed
their exploration box features four samples of their socalled microbatch bars made in smaller quantities than many bigger companies the samples arent huge  just eight squares  but more than enough to get an idea of what to expect and it isnt really a box either  the foilwrapped squares are rolled in a funkylooking bamboo mat but it makes for a unique way to present the chocolate the chocolate isnt the glossiest around but that might be down to the fact that it did travel before it reached my hands looking at the four kinds unwrapped in turn we have cocoa latte  top left green tangerine  top right dark fire  bottom left and black science madagascar  bottom right but lets get to the tastingcocoa latte   this one has a surprisingly high amount of cocoa for a milk chocolate but one taste leaves absolutely no doubt because the dominant flavour is a rich creaminess thats about it though making it a little onedimensional it would probably make good truffles because it could benefit from another flavour or some texturegreen tangerine   the lack of a strong orangey smell suggests that this might be a little too subtle for its own good but that isnt the case the tangerine flavour is accompanied by bursts of sweetness that are really surprising and they mask the bitterness of the chocolate until the very end not your typical citrus chocolate at all and really good dark fire   again the negligible aroma belies what lies ahead because the cinnamon appears almost instantly and continues to warm while the chilli slowly builds in intensity before taking over the spices and bitter chocolate then dance around together before slowly fading away leaving a lovely smouldering sensation in your mouth for quite a while afterwards just as good as i rememberedblack science madagascar   despite being the highest percentage in this collection it isnt the darkest in colour suggesting that this might not deliver on the  potential but it does it has lots of fruity notes with cherry dominating and it both starts and finishes strongly without much of a lull in between surprisingly not a bitter chocolate at all and so that makes two very good chocolates one good and one that i can take or leave and my potential obsession with soma chocolatemaker continuesinteresting packaging not seen anything like that beforei agree thats some pretty stylish packaging plus isnt it wonderful when hints pay off  id definitely be keen to try the dark fire one love me some spicy chocolatethese all sound yummy but i would go for the dark fire alsoive been enjoying some high cocoa content milk chocolates of late and im not sure id call them one dimensional i suppose it depends on whether you have a preference for chocolate with something in it or just the tastes of the cocoa love the packaging by the way  very unusual
the hotel chocolat box above is as youd expect rather pretty lots of pink a pretty design and  importantly  a nice solid feeling construction the thorntons box on the other hand doesnt show the same design flair a red box with clear plastic cutouts  showing the chocolates inside which just feels cheap and flimsy compared to the hotel chocolat box a clear win for hotel chocolat hereonce you get inside the thorntons box redeems itself a little while im still not a fan of the clear plastic the arrangement is quite pleasing with a larger heart surrouned by  smaller onesi still prefer the hotel chocolat box though the arrangement isnt particularly exciting with  hearts arranged into three simple rows but somehow the plastic just feels higher qualitynow we get to the actual chocolate a quick glance at the blurb on the back of the boxes reveals an all too common storylooking at the ingredients the thorntons box seems to contain more sugar and vegetable oil than the hotel chocolat box although its difficult to do a direct comparison here because the fillings are differentwhile the thorntons hearts are simple described as a selection of chocolate truffles pralines and caramels the hotel chocolat melting hearts have individual descriptions  chocolate mousse coffee praline milk praline with cocoa crispies macadamia and coconut orange praline gianduja caramel praline pistachio praline and sticky toffee and bananaas you can see sizewise the individual hearts are very similar thorntons on the left hotel chocolat on the right each hotel chocolat heart is decorated with a coloured stripe or dot while the thorntons hearts are a little more plainthe real difference though is the taste though eating one heart from each box and the quality of the hotel chocolat product becomes quickly apparentthe thorntons hearts are sweet and buttery and all quite similar the hotel chocolat versions are rich full of flavour and much less sweet the cocoa flavours really shine through the same goes for the fillings although none of the flavours are particularly strong everything about the taste and texture of hotel chocolats hearts says qualityof course some people will say this isnt a fair comparison for a start at  for  grams hotel chocolat melting hearts are more than twice the price of the   grams thorntons version but that difference in price becomes very obvious when you compare the two side by side not only are you getting a significantly higher quality product with hotel chocolat but youre also getting more variety in a package that just looks and feels nicer i know which id rather get as a valentines gift and thats a hint by the wayi love the chocolates from hotel chocolat they are simply devine when i treat myself to some i hide the box away my generous nature does not extend to sharing these chocolateswhy go for the now high street chain hotel chocolat  overpriced due to fancy packaging  why not try montezumas  innovative and quirky yet chocolate goods are far superior to hotel chocolat and cheaper  choc for thought ok jo ill bite assuming you dont work for montezumasmontezumas packaging is awful they wrap their chocolate bars in cellophane packets for startersi thought this was completely pointless i would have preferred a classic review for both because anyone could see thorntons was going to lose in every wayso i guess i wont be getting any valentines chocs from you then meghanr u fatdom i think between us we may well have just lost our future free samples of montezumas and thorntons gear dno im sure they value our constructive criticism so basically it is down to the packaging nuff saidits the cocoa solids that count  until thorntons raises its quality its place on the high st remains precarious  its been downhill for thorntons since the mids when they stopped selling their premium range which featured a walnut kirsch marzipan a goldflecked champagne truffle and a grand marnier truffle that beat everything else available at the time  thorntons chocolate is not chocolatey enough and is too sickly sweet  hotel dotchlet as it is known in our home as that is how my son pronounced it as a young child for me everytime
i found this bar in my local budgens supermarket yes im that posh nestled in with the usual nestl and cadbury suspects weve never reviewed anything from goldkenn so obviously this had to go straight into my basketthe chocolate while thin is particularly nice a  milk chocolate its smooth and creamy without being too sweet once you break into a chunk though youre greeted by a fairly substantial sugar shell keeping the liquid liqueur from the chocolatethe liqueur itself is very thin so i assume that sugar coating is actually quite necessary to keep everything from disappearing into a mush the ingredients on the box describe it as grand marnier extract i dont really know what that means or how its extracted but if you like grand marnier then youre sure to like this the alcohol is quite strong but not overpowering and all in all the flavours work very well with the chocolate particularly nice to warm up on a cold winters eveningan enjoyable bar that disappeared far more quickly than it should ill certainly be looking out for more from goldkennnice review dom but whats cod got to do with a winters evening pi picked up a cointreau verson of this bar last year not realising that it had the dreaded sugar shell shudder chocolate making has advanced so i dont know why manufacturers would still be using this methodshady fixed the fishy typo christine im sure they have their reasons  i suspect its easiercheaper to use a sugar shell like i said i dont really mind myselfgoldkenn also produce some liqueur bars without sugar shell and they are really very nice oh ive just looked over that website they also have liqueur truffles oh how i wish i could find some of their stuff
and thats exactly what they did well not exactly first they obviously had to make it irresistible to children introducing the elite fingers with popping candy from the moment you pick up the cardboard box this chocolate or rather these chocolates as they are individually wrapped fingers you can imagine the welloiled wheels of the marketing machine at work the bright pink cover with the happy cow pictures actually says in hebrew milk chocolate filled with lots and lots and lots of popping candy and dairy cream show me a child that could resist such a statement and ill show you a very odd childyou can tear off a strip at the top of the box to reveal the tops of the individually wrapped fingers each with a different brightly coloured and beautiful design on foil paper  if that dose of cuteness didnt get you then the fingers themselves with their raised border and new variation on the cow relief theme will definitely make you go awwww and the taste well its very sweet the dairy cream is very much like our friend the biscuit chocolate sans the biscuit but possibly even sweeter the sweetness sneaks up on you so i found that i could eat a couple or more fingers quite easily and then suddenly be hit by the overly sugary aftertaste  its certainly the sweetest out of all their chocolates i tried recently which is somewhat worrying considering how strongly its aimed at childrenthe popping candy effect is definitely pronounced but considering the packaging declares there are lots and lots and lots of the things inside id have expected an even stronger effect i do believe that the standard popping candy bar has more of them inall in all i think this is a good chocolate bar for kids and their parents its sweet enough for kids to like and they will love the fancy packaging in my day kids would probably collect and trade the individual wrappings but nowadays i think theyd be more interested in the accompanying tv ad with giant d cartoon superhero characters whose mission is the figure out how to stuff incredible amounts of candy into the chocolate fingers for parents one would assume the fact that kids can have a single finger as a treat and can even pick their chosen finger out from the box without needing to take all of them out which may lead to them wanting more than one is definitely a good thing and makes up from the chocolate obviously having more than its fair share of sugaras for me its the perfect cute chocolate bar to have next to coffee but dont make the mistake of having more than a couple or youll wish youd had none at allooh i really want to try thesenow i have to figure out who i know that is going to israel soonoh my that sounds amazing  its a shame its overly sweet though that would put me off slightly  loving the packaging too very colourfuljust got three packs of them courtesy of my sister who lives in efrat  they are wicked tasty  the fingers are too small  just give me a full bar size
ive always been a bit of a fan of real citrus flavours with dark chocolate its a combination that can be wonderful but is easy to get wrong and often ends up a sickly mess particularly when mixed with cream but the mix of sicilian lemon white chocolate and cream works very well here its neither too intense or too creamy and the hint of white chocolate brings the flavours together with a bit of sweetnessyou dont get much dark chocolate for your money as the shells are very thin but what you do get is quite good its  cocoa solids and the slight bitterness complements the sweet filling nicely but you dont get long to savour the flavours before it melts away to reveal the smooth and light lemony filling but i just cant get past the fact that g isnt enough i polished this box off in about ten minutes so if youre planning on sharing youll just have to plan ahead and buy two boxes instead and then send one to meare waitroise dark chocolate and lemon truffles gluten free
well christmas is over and done with and the next vaguelychocolateyholiday is just around the corner yes handily squeezed in just before easter comes st valentines daythis g offering from thorntons is frankly part of their old school cheap and chearful range rather than the high quality products weve come to love recently it consists of two hollow chocolate birds and a single truffle chocolate im not sure why you just get one  unless thorntons have a secret plan to get couples everywhere to fight over chocolate on valentines daythe chocolate here is basic although its decorated with milk and white chocolate the birds are predominantly a  milk chocolate which is acceptable rather than outstanding its more milky than chocolatey and tastes like generic easter egg chocolate thats been moulded into bird shapesthe heart shaped truffle was surprisingly nice  very sweet but very soft and creamy with a distinctly buttery flavour perhaps not surprising given that butteroil and butter appear high up on the ingredients list as does vegetable oil unfortunatelyfrankly i think thats an outdated view and theres no reason why something like this couldnt be made with quality ingredients and presented in more stylish packaging it might end up costing a couple of quid more but this is intended purely as a gift for a loved one and im quite certain people would pay that little extra for a gift thats a little more memorabledom your review has come up exactly a week before mine and it pretty much shoots along the same line as my own i think throntons are a very confused brand at the moment they are really lacking directionjim i get the impression theyre trying to keep shareholders happy by sticking with what we know its clearly not working and consumers expect more now the likes of hotel chocolat etc are popping up on more and more high streets im starting to fear for their survivallacking direction theyre not doing too bad with m profit on a  turnover of mi wouldnt say theyre pulling in two directions id say its classic market segmentation as you say they have a separate range of classic cheap straightforward products to aim at one segment not you and another more expensive more sophisticated range aimed at another segment you as long as both segments of the market want what theyre offering and continue to buy it from them they just have to make sure the ranges are clearly indicated so people dont buy from the wrong range and end up disappointed price is a simple way of indicating the different ranges and allows you to make more money too
once again were in the noveltysouvenirjoke category with this item however the information on the packet told me that countys who made this item are in fact chocolate makers in their own right and their chocolate pasty appears to have been stickered with a west cornwall pasty co sticker so perhaps this is more widely availableits also not cheap and nasty chocolate  with  cocoa solids it stands up well next to many other milk chocolate products the makers claim that this is made from premium grade beans  and just a dash of bourbon vanilla so it sounded promisingi had to take a very sharp knife to this little beast in order to extract a mouthsized chunk and when i popped it into my mouth i was pleasantly surprised soft full bodied milk chocolate with that hint of vanilla not too sugary and with a good mouthfeel good body on the cocoa flavours and a clean finish it is indeed pretty good quality stuff  something of a relief as this isnt the cheapest novelty chocolate in the world there again as we all know you pay for what you get and im happy to say that this rather unusual item is worth buying if youre looking for something a little different in the way of a chocolatey treat i wouldnt go out of my way to buy another chocolate pasty but im definitely going to keepo an eye out for more county chocolate products in futureso it sounds like it wasnt stuffed with anything egnuts or fruit but is just solid chocolatelike pam i thought this would have something inside that would make it more pasty like surelyi did not like it at all it was too much of cheap plain chocolate
anyway cherry kitkat the most obvious exterior difference is that the wafery goodness is hidden inside a box which cracks rather satisfyingly down the middle and inside there are two very pink foil packages each with a two finger bar inside now i dont know about you but i find it tough to stop at just two fingers of kitkat so this did seem a little weird at first but after tasting this it makes a lot more sensethis thing is so sweet i had to stop after two fingers and keep the other packet for later maybe thats the whole idea or perhaps you are supposed to share with a friend either way it would be tough to eat the entire thing in one sitting  definitely not one for the diabetic in your life that said the cherry is a pleasant change even if it isnt consistent with every mouthful almost like there are little intense pockets of flavour hidden throughout but it does give me a taste for more of these flavoured kitkats and i do have a birthday coming up next month fingers crossedi cant decide whether that pink on the actual bar is pretty and subtle or sickly and nauseating   apparently there is also a bubblegum flavour one which is covered in blue chocolate tooblue chocolate now that would just be weirdwhen we went to japan we picked up quite a few of these bars including green tea and wasabi  they seem to be quite popular over there fairly expensive tooive heard a lot of people complain about the sweetness of japanese chocolate  a lot of my japanese friends complain about american chocolate too  my theory is and this is what my friends in japan told me but im not  sure its true is that they use different sugar to make the chocolate giving it a stronger sweetness that people from other places arent used tolove the kitkat bars  i used to buy them at narita  although even better than the kitkats are the royce chocolates  ive been buying them in the us from royceusacom  but its getting way too addictivethey should do aero cherry next
this g chocolate fish was a christmas present not the kind of thing id usually buy for myself even for review purposes its clearly designed as a gift  a novelty item  rather than a quality chocolate product it even has a stand so you can display it proudly on your mantelpiece how thoughtfulthe dark chocolate is  cocoa solids which is par for the course for something like this but it also contains coloured white and milk chocolate which the label informs me is  cocoa solids thankfully the ingredients list is nice and short and free from vegetable fat or any nasty additives beyond the colouringwhile its clearly a novelty the chocolate is quite acceptable its definitely not going to be to the true dark chocolate lovers tastes as its quite sweet but i think the kids would enjoy it it has some nice cocoa notes without being bitter in anywaybut i have to wonder how many of these will actually get eaten its very pretty and with that builtin stand its designed to be displayed its nice enough to eat straight out of the box but im not sure id want to eat it after its been sat on someones shelf gathering dust for a few monthswow this is beautiful i would never be able to eat it what a waste of good chocolate thats a real work of arti didnt dis yo fish i ate yo fishand thank you it was lovely 
but lets back up to that trio first each one has  grams the  milk chocolate figs were roughlooking but on tasting i wondered why we dont get more figchocolate combos similar to raisins being chewy with tiny seeds yet more unique not exactly sweet not really tangy just moreish and deliciousthe crunchy pearls are very odd and quite good with such minute pearls one wouldnt imagine theres space for the promised crunchy biscuit cereals unless the  dark chocolate is a paperthin coating yet they work the crunch is there with its deep oat cereal taste the chocolate is there in an equal partnership maybe it was the breakfast suggestion from cereal that kept me thinking on chocolate waffles as i chewed and chewed and thought theyre so small i can have more small things are so deadlysimilar to the  of the bar version the candied orange peels use  dark chocolate they are much the same thing except that the chocolate receives less focus the jelly candy texture seems to scare me  i think im wondering what its doing in my chocolate is it just me that these are my least favorite of the range probablynow we can return to that beautiful box which has a total of  grams its four sections are home to dark chocolate  hazelnuts and almonds more orange peels milk chocolate  hazelnuts and almonds and milk chocolate biscuits the chocolate is thick with the glaze kept to a minimum the nuts are all good quality both milk and dark versions are nice but i find myself leaning towards the milk circle once again the buttery milk chocolate just feels like it was born to accompany these nuts while the dark adds a strong guiding hand to them i imagine you know how i feel about the orange peels now right good if thats your thing really even i cant say theyre horrible but it isnt mine the biscuits however i am enjoying more delicate than the pearls with milk chocolate instead of dark and purebutter biscuits in place of the heavier oat kind they are also sweeter yet not overdone it is a pure taste of pure biscuit and pure chocolate the crunch is soft as the biscuit center prepares to melt right along with the chocolate i can see this box as the perfect thing for a small gettogether in a rush it already has the presentation and it has the balance of both milk and dark chocolateall much better done than your usuals my only qualm came when i looked up the prices im glad i didnt have anything in my mouth or i might have met an early demise from choking the small containers are  each and the box is  if youre going by gramsounces and comparing to a box of truffles i suppose that is the regular price but still im very glad they came to me free of charge and i will recommend them provided you are quite aware that well you are paying for valrhonathat is a pretty pretty box of chocolatethat looks fantasticthat packaging is exquisite  and im also excited purely because ive never heard of this product of valrhonas before which is a quite rare happening pi completely understand your aversion to orange peel  chocolate but cant help thinking my favourite of the lot would be the dark chocolate pearls i do love me some oats ive bought the equinoxe orangettes before and though theyre nice ive actually had better ones for far cheaper and often using valrhona chocolate i think the bars are probably the best valuei love valrhonas packaging overall  their product boxes and sample boxes are outsanding  i have not tried equinoxe but manjari valrhonas  is my favorite chocolate
as far as i can work out these are being marketed as one of those little self indulgent treats for grownups or as a lunchbox filler for kids and before anyone asks croc does not mean that ive been eating crocodilefilled chocolate bars  these are crocquant crispy to you and me bars filled with a mixture of praline and crisped ricetheyre certainly a little treat  just over g of product divided into two squaresas you can see theres a generous amount of chocolate covering these bars which makes for a very pleasant mix on the palate the praline is soft rich and buttery with loads of nutty flavour and the crispy rice adds that little extra crunch to the overall mouthfeelthe filling is very light soft and crumbly as you can see which means that a square of one of these bars isnt around for long and therein lies the issue really at a shade over p per bar these are pricey little treats hardly the sort of thing youre going to throw into billys lunch box every morning are they of course if your kids are called penelope and peregrine it might be a different matter but i cant see many parents spending more on a chocolate bar than they would on the other contents of a lunchtheres nothing wrong with these little bars per se other than the fact that i cant see where they lie in terms of a market an occasional indulgence to have with a cup of coffee maybe but certainly not a daily snack for your kids way too pricey for everyday consumption and yet somewhat insubstantial in terms of grams per pound i suspect that these are not top of gallers sales charts like most people i can countenance spending  on a really good box of chocolates as a treat but the best part of a quid for two bites of chocolate not me at any ratewinner on taste big loser on priceany praline and crispy rice bit combo is always divinethis something on the last photo looks like a man xd look
as with the orange spice bar the chocolate is a little too sweet and a little too bland for my taste i really want something darker and deeper particularly with ginger but theres just not that much going onunlike the orange spice bar where the clove flavour was almost overwhelming theres very little to see  or taste  in the way of ginger here there are a few very small lumps and bumps in the base of the bar which i assume are ginger pieces but nowhere near enoughperhaps ive just been unlucky with my choice of flavours im sure ubuntu chocolate is made with love and care but neither the overintense orange spice or the bland ginger bars have done much for mecomments are closed
my sisterinlaw recently made a quick trip to ireland as you do and clearly knows me too well the chocolate ginger reputation is well and truly preceding mein my check of the web site i found the cost of these is kind of frightful  about  each for  grams youd hope for that money its worthwhile and doubly so having survived the trip back to the land down undermy criteria for a good chocolate ginger as ive written before is root ginger crystallised big pieces lots of it the ginger needs to give you a smack around the head the chocolate needs to be dark rich and there needs to be lots of it blocks and bars are all very well but big lumpy chunky pieces are even betterwell im pleased to report that this has to rate as one of the best chocolate gingers ever on the highly biased scale  another  out of  which is high praise indeed for a blockthe chocolate was not in the least bitter like some dark chocolates can get and is surprisingly rich and creamy it melts very slowly and there really are pieces of ginger in there with a delightful zing as you find them and bite them the pieces are very small  mere grains  but its enoughthis is so good that the lady of the house is cooking dinner and ive just scoffed down three rather large pieces ill be in trouble now for ruining my appetite but it was worth itthis looks and sounds amazing dhehe really sweeat post 
according to the press release that came with these today  january th  is the most depressing day of the year and that apparently is why thorntons are giving away a million of them to people like you yes you all you need to do is pop along to a thorntons store today and beg  assuming they havent run out by the time you read this that would be depressingwhether free chocolate will help cure your depression or simply serve as a reminder of the futility of life and push you further toward your inevitable suicide remains to be seen but that probably has more to do with you than the chocolateso what are meltsthey taste pretty good toothe milk chocolate is a pleasing  cocoa solids and although theres no mention of where the beans came from its smooth creamy and chocolatey with just the right level of sweetness the chocolate is nice and thick and melts away slowly to a soft smooth praline filling although im not a particular fan of praline i did enjoy this as the name suggests its soft enough to melt in the mouth but its also quite tasty with a pleasant level nuttiness and a hint of butterinessoverall melts are very nice but they dont quite match the quality of a lindor ball thorntons are launching these at an introductory price of  for a g pouch which i think is reasonable value share them around the office and i dont think youll get too many complaints from your suicidal workmates for g  sounds like a pretty good price to mesend em down under in august so now im very curious  why is january th the most depressing day of the yearvery clever scientists with too much time on their hands worked it outi think because  its a monday  its cold out  the holidays are over  spring summer and holidays are still a long way off
stockings ive always thought add to the fanciful fun feel of christmas sure tearing and hacking away at wrapping paper has its charms but a stocking filled with candy and a trinket or so  thats festive hence when my brother and i went up to our parents this year i went with candies and chocolates in tow what does it matter that we would now be four adults edible holiday traditions are not to be disposed of so easilyall the same these dark peppermints are all one expects from lindor truffles some cross between chocolates and truffles the thick chocolate shell is home to the lindor filling creamy as butter cool melting almost like the way foam dissipates smoothness is one thing lindt does so wellthe peppermint has an even taste its coolness combining well with the coolness of the filling it makes its presence known without being at all strong just adds some flavor to perk up the chocolate that chocolate i would probably call it boring on its own at  though nice enough it tastes of plain chocolate and nothing moretheyre not the sort of chocolates that wow you but they do fit into the holidays nicely i certainly didnt see any of my family complaining about themcomments are closed
a combination of geography and finances has stopped me from personally trying his wares but thankfully the festive season is the perfect time the gift of chocolate so i was presented with one of their copper foil ballotin boxes filled with supposedly the best of what chocolaterie bernard callebaut have to offer or at least what the person working in the shop thought was their best chocolates and heres what i think layer by layer top layermiddle layerbottom layerleaf  the layer of blackcurrent and the layer of milk chocolate ganache seem to be at crosspurposes here and dont work that well together considering my love for fruity chocolate i should like this a lot more than i actually doso was it the best that canada has to offer well the highs such as the strawberry gilberte and cinnamon ginger were very very good and while there were no real lows there were also quite a few that were just pleasant and nothing more it was still a very good collection a lovely gift and an entertaining way to spend a couple of afternoons and there are still plenty more bernard callebaut creations to try before passing final judgement  maybe next christmasinteresting i had no idea barry had a canadian brotheri have to say im a little jealous they used to have a shop in the phoenix area but when i went it was long gone i really dont live in the best place for chocolate  good review aside from being informative and to the point it doesnt dwell on the negatives just enthuses about the good stuff but best of all its made me ravenous for a cinnamon gingerbut please tell me you didnt eat all of the chocolates in one sittingi just got a mini box that had the cinnamon ginger in it for vday and i think it is one of the best boxed chocolates i have ever had almost reminds me of pumpkin pie spice as it leaves its impression on my palatei just wanted to let everyone know that if you have not had bernard callebaut chocolates then you are truly missing outi just had one of the first chocolates made of youth juiceit was amazingthis chocolate is delicious and nutricious with the highest antioxident value of any other chocolate ever madethank you bernard callebautregarding doms comment above  barry callebaut is not the name of a person  barry callebaut is the name of a cocoa manufacturer whos name is comprised of the names of  merged companies  cacao barry and callebaut chocolate  bernard is a descendant th generationof the callebaut chocolate family from belgium and has operated his own company in calgary for the past  yearsit was a perhaps poor attempt at humour peter 
another new offering from cadbury here  part of their bags of stuff that are way too big for one person but like thats going to stop me trying range i thinkthis g bag contains a large number of dairy milk buttons each filled with a small amount of caramel im not sure why they went for the nibbles name theyre quite clearly  buttons and they could have gone for a recordbreaking threebrandname crossover cabury dairy milk with caramel buttons monicker if only theyd thought about it but as snack foods go theyre pretty moreish despite being incredibly sweet theres no way you could just eat one of these particularly when you get  of them in a single packet thats just a rough estimateas is so often the case with cadbury products i dont particularly like them but once i start eating them its very difficult to stop its not as though i can hide the bag because ive tried that before and i know all my secret hiding places now so ill leave you with a simple warning buy them at your own risk and never eat them alonei am partial to the buttons but will try these soon as i can find them in the bad old us of a  home to satans chocolatei am eating a bag of these now i am alonehelp me  om nom nom nom nom nom
one thing i will say about berlins schnefeld airport is that the shops have a pretty good selection of chocolate to choose from and  my eye was drawn to a couple of bars made by knig why spanish pine nuts in particular i dont know but i couldnt recall having eaten pine nuts with chocolate before and the cocoa contant and price tag hinted at a quality productat almost  a bar this  cocoa milk chocolate was priced well above more familiar swiss offerings and so i was loking for something remarkable in terms of taste the high cocoa content was a good start   is a respectable amount of cocoa theres also natural vanilla in there as well and  pine nuts  a not insignificant amountwhen i tasted a piece of this chocolate i was immediately struck by the vanilla it comes in on a wave of sweet creamy milk chocolate and tends to dominate in the first moments of tasting once the chocolate begins to melt the cocoa flavours start to develop and they are light soft and creamy theres a definite sweetness to the whole taste and the cocoa is quite delicate tempered as it is with the vanilla bite into a pine nut and you release a nutty fresh flavour into the mix im assuming that spanish pine nuts are particularly good for flavour these are very light roasted so their kernels are like little puffs of nutty flavour which melt into the chocolate and vanilla giving the whole taste experience a little texture o rnot as one prefers you can always squirrel the nuts into a cheek for after the chocolate has gonein spite of the obvious tourist souvenir wrapper this chocolate is actually pretty good it has a very soft light mouthfeel and delivers good flavour perhaps a little heavy on the vanilla for my tastes but nonetheless very pleasant there are definitely worse ways to spend your last few euroscomments are closed
unfortunatley where the kellogs version was actually quite chocolately this particular bar is almost totally lacking in anything resembling chocolatethat little squiggle down the centre is all you get id estimate maybe  grams of chocolate at the most so little in fact that you just cant taste it the sticky syrupy wheatyness is all you get even when you try to get a mouthful of the chocolate it makes you wonder why they bothered at allim sure theyre simply trying to keep the calories down so parents of the kids that are going to be on the receiving end of this bar dont complain too much but all thats going to happen is that the kids are going to complain and the parents will get the rice krispies bar insteadaside from the lack of chocolate theres not much worth writing home about either chew a chunk a couple of times and it disappears into nothing ultimately leaving you unsatisfied perhaps there are kids out there who just cant get enough sugar puffs who might like this but there are literally hundreds of better tastier and healthier cereal bars out there for the rest of usjust cant live without chocolates di absolutely love chocolate  reading things like this make me very hungryi love it
i like that valrhona doesnt stick to the same design for everything there was one design for the estate range one for the flavored bars and another for these both inside and out from the lowest percentage up areabinao  powerful  tannic  and african origin this one seems a bit floral also with the bitter taste working all throughout its surprising how much sweetness stays in dont get me wrong by no means is it a sweet chocolate but the sweetness doesnt entirely disappear in the bitternessthese are all mostly flawless chocolate bars with smooth and perfect melting textures but most of them dont stick out to me  thats why valrhona works well for making new chocolates with it wont distract from added flavors but still delivers quality in any case you can hardly go wrong with the quality of the grands crus range the two word descriptions provide a fairly reliable guide for choosing whats best for you my own favorites are the tainori caraibe and guanajaand now im droolingits really hard not to die of envy when you get sent such chocolates to taste i relaly enjoyed the abinao although i was surprised at how subtle it was and would have preferred a bit more punch i do like how they give brief tasting notes in the descriptions as it allows me to stay away from the fruitier chocolates  i dont mind floral flavours but i dont like dark chocolates too strong in citrus reading your review i think i shall aim for the caraibe next ive tried a lot of their line and am rarely disappointed i like the fruitiness of the caraibe
the milk chocolate here is  cocoa solids and in my opinion its much nicer than the dark chocolate version for one thing it does actually taste of chocolate surprisingly its also less sweet than the dark chocolate versionthat lesssweet chocolate makes all the difference to the other flavours too you can actually taste the guinness in this one of course for a nonguinness lover like myself thats not necessarily a good thing and i personally think it just tastes like the chocolate is a little stale but true guinness aficionados will no doubt get more out of this than its siblingwhat a nice combination  milk chocolate and guinness   grams is a nice size for a chocolate bar too  you wont feel weighted downsounds to me like you really want to try a chocolate and beer experience go for southern tier brewerys mokah stout that beer tasted so much like chocolate yet beer it was outstanding
im happy to say that this bar has a much more subtle aroma about it  much more in the way of chocolate and a mere hint of potential alcoholic nastiness break open one of the squares and you can see the dark creamy fillingthis is where the flavour lies so when you start to taste this bar the chocolate introduces itself first soft delicate cocoa flavours slightly sweet with dark undertones give way to the richer absinthe truffle centre as the shell disappears then the centre takes over flooding the mouth with the mildly alcoholic aniseed like flavours of the absinthe in spite of the strong flavour of the centre it didnt overrun my palate and a few minutes after tasting all i had in my mouth were the flavours of the chocolate with a whiff of the alcoholall in all i rather enjoyed eating this chocolate i have to retract my comment that some things were not meant to be paired with chocolate because this bar mixes absinthe and chocolate and pulls it off rather well obviously this isnt a flavour that everyones going to love but as far as alcohol and chocolate combinations go its a pretty good onehmm im still not convinced by absinthe and chocolate or anything else for that matteris it anything like the dolfin bar with anise seeds because that is actually quite nice in fact i think i have a bar of it lying around here somewheremichael  it actually has a uniquely alcoholic character all of its own not really aniseed unlike the italian bar and definitely alcoholicdom  youre not convinced about anything else youve been cooped up indoors too longim not convinced by absinthe and anything else together at the same time 
guest chocablogger natasha faria is back with a look at the south african version of nestls milo barmilo and its chocolatey counterparts are a mainstay of south african youth and varsity life but i have never known nestl to present it in any manner other than the powder or the chocolate im about to describe the slab is regular nestl milk chocolate with milo mixed in our milo seems to be chunkier than that of australia kath implied that theirs was pretty powdery but i guess most things in south africa are a little rougher than elsewhere  the slab is obviously left to settle because the milo is spread all over but mainly at the bottom of the bareating this kind of chocolate is pure heaven im a chewing taster but either of the chewing or melting approaches to tasting allows you to enjoy this the crunchy slightly salty and honeyflavoured taste of the milo really complements the creamy nestl chocolate and i think the contrast of textures definitely works in the slabs favour so either you chew and enjoy the crunchy creaminess of this or you let it melt in your mouth and just chew the leftover milo after either way its definitely a winwin situationin my humble opinion our milo slab rocks however i think that the simplicity of this bar wins over the australian version as does the fact that this milo is rougher i honestly dont think that we need the addition of caramel to up the flavour quotient of this and i challenge the oz committee to defy medarn i was in australia four months and despite seeing adverts for it never tried milo i feel ive seriously missed out cant imagine milo without caramel but by the sounds of it its still nicegood reviewthe australian version originally never had the caramel in it and it was much better i wish it was still available i preferred the original aussie milo bar to no caramel i find the caramel ruined it now i wait till i can get some milo chocolates in singapore or malaysia for my fix i especially like the milo nuggetsi dont think australian milo is powdery either its got a gritty texture singapore milo however is very powderystill nothing beats getting a cup filling it almost to the brim with milo itself and putting just a thin line of milk over the top so that you can eat huge amounts of milo straight without your mother being any the wiser the chunky australian milo bar is a bit brittle and with a somewhat harsh texture i love milo straight from the tin on a spoon but the bar is a little disappointing it is a somewhat clumsy contrivance a nice idea that is missing somethingi would like to know if you would be so kind as to sponsor us witha hamper or two for our annual ladies golf tournament at zebula near bela bela south africa  we have between  and  ladies taking part every year and we would appreciate if you could be part of our golf tournament  the event is played over  day with a prize giving party the nd night where we show our appreciation by announcing all our sponsorsthe date for our next event will be  febr   march please be so kind as to let me know whether or not you would be able to assist ustanking you kindly
this review is coming at you from tel aviv where i am currently wintering as my family have been showering me with gifts of chocolate some old favourites as well as well as others that are new to me there is plenty of work to be done while im herechocolate covered biscuits are so tasty  the imprinted cows are a cute touch
and they really are quite salty  but in a way that works perfectly with the chocolate the pistachios reminded me of sweetened popcorn with a nutty caramel flavour  the chocolate and pistachios on their own would be pretty good but when combined something wonderful happens the combination of flavours works really well for meand the textures work equally well the soft creamy milk chocolate and light crunchiness of the pistachios make this block incredibly moreish theres no way you can just eat a single square of this stuffthis is probably my new favourite thorntons block definitely worth tryingi personally think its quite gorgeous the bursts of salt as you get a bit of pistachio perfectly compliment the sweetness as you said just lovely i wont tell you how many ive eatengo on tell us how many youve eaten i couldnt help myself and picked up a bar on my way back from lunch and what a delicious bar it is i love the contrasting sweetness of the chocolate with the saltiness of the pistachio on my thorntons favourite list this ones right at the top together with the macadamia and the tonka bean barsoh my i must must must get this when i go to england for the first time next month im obsessed with salt in chocolate  its just magical  and also adore pistachios im also feeling validated because i just wrote a review where i said chocoloves dark chocolate with sea salt and almonds reminded me of butter caramel popcorn and felt a bit silly saying so now i feel bettersounds superb  wish i could get them herehaving just started my own budding chocolate blog i bought some of this chocolate and opened it for review this evening  having suffered a cut bleeding gum and come worryingly close to a broken tooth i spit the stuff out to find sharp solid pieces of nut shell in it  its a shame because until that point pardon the pun i was enjoying the taste very muchneedless to say ive emailed thorntons about the problem and hope theyll get back to me  however i wanted to warn other readers that this may be a manufacturing problemgill what happened after the same thing happened to me and its a good thing i didnt give any to my niece theres no warning on the box is it worth me complaining
i had a friend who found a cute little ceramic pig in a shop she bought it and proudly displayed it on a shelf in her room and from that point on she was the pig person birthdays christmas and pretty much any other occasion she was given pigs she didnt particularly like pigs  it was just that one original pig she liked  but she was labelled from that point on and ended up with an impressive collection she didnt really want fortunately i really really like chocolate and so the fact that now everybody i know is giving me chocolate because of this blog isnt really too much of a problem and i am very happy with the large box of chocolate that ive accumulated in fact it is kind of entertaining because people are trying to find the most unusual stuff to give me just like in the case of werthers original caramel chocolate dark with  cacaomost people are familiar with werthers hard butterscotch candies but they arent a name that immediately jumps to mind when it comes to chocolate i think at one point they had chocolate covered butterscotch sweets but these are a completely different and i didnt know what to expectfrom the front of the bag it became apparent that these were marbled chocolate and caramel although that didnt really clear anything up because i was now imagining something chewy the chocolates are an appealing oval shape  not too thick and right at the borderline between one and two bites the marbling means that theres no denying that these are pretty but unfortunately that just isnt reflected in the taste at all in fact the taste is rather strange and just plain confusing and definitely not chewythe caramel and chocolate fight it out right from the start and neither of the flavours win out they clash and it isnt pretty it turns out that the caramel is actually caramel flavoured white chocolate so they are much sweeter than they should be and dont even melt nicely to be honest alarm bells should have gone off when they described  chocolate as rich and dark but i never did expect the peculiar aftertaste that is neither chocolate nor caramel definitely not recommended my grandpa loves werthers original carameli live in aberdeen scotland we have large stores nearby tesco asdas morrisons and sainsburys none of these stores have the new werthers original dark caramel chocolate dark for sale in their stores and yet your product is being advertised on all the television channels here in the uki cannot but wethers chocolate in my area whyi love the new werthers chocolates especially the dark flavour  but they are harfor thisy reason d to find in the shops  is there any reason for this
i dont much care for guinness so its probably lucky that this little bar contains just  of the stuff  the other  it seems is pure marketingthe dark bar never gave a cocoa percentage but this one does  a disappointing  and that comes through in the taste although there is some vague chocolatelyness its extremely sweet and its quite difficult to taste anything beyond the sugarthere is a very slight flavour of something that could have been related to guinness at some point in its life but its barely discernible if you hadnt read the wrapper youd have no idea what it was in fact for all i know the taste could just be that the chocolate is a bit offinside each square of chocolate is a fair amount of caramel which like the chocolate doesnt taste of much its sweet and there is a vague butteriness to it a quick glance at the ingredients  glucose syrup sweetened condensed milk vegetable fat  will give you an idea of what to expectas is so often the case the overall product is edible and not offensive but it just doesnt do anything for me the fact that only g of guinness went into this g bar shows its a gimmick rather than a treat for a guinness lover one to avoidugh what a let down i wonder why such a distinctive brand of beer would put their name on such mediocre snackssince the guinness content is so low are children allowed to buy this bar i got asked for id to buy some kahlua chocolates and i was humiliated because it was the one time all year id gone out without my pursei guess it depends where you live i doubt thered be any problem with children buying this in the ukeurope im guessing your from the us thoughha im australian but living in the us so yeah i do find their liquor chocolate freakouts laughable
pecan pie isnt so much of my holiday traditions i can only even think of once that ive even eaten it yet its warm feel especially when combined with chocolate makes for a fitting wintry treat these squares keep up that feel  as soon as you tear their wrappers a maple sugar and chocolate smell shoots out as quickly as light from a lamp when you flip the switch inviting to say the leastthe squares are milk chocolate with pieces of caramelized pecans the chocolate is creamy and milky but fulltasting it blends with the maple sugarcaramel flavor the creaminess of the chocolate standing apart from the crunch of the pecans that difference in texture only makes you want to eat more and more i find myself glad that the bag was double the usual size with about twentyfour squares the candy dish i filled is already emptying so im obviously not the only one to enjoy themim only wondering what sort of idea ghirardelli had when they came up with their little rectangular bags of chocolates especially around the holidays i find myself asking whether the bags are nice enough for gifts or if they are meant more for eating yourself putting in candy dishes and stuffing  stockings with i suppose ghirardelli is trying to fit itself for any of these purposes whichever you choose the pecan pies do taste deliciousonce the thrill of my new years diet wears off ill be sure to give these a tryi  ghirardelli
as you can see the underside looks quite normal although breaking the bar along those chunks is nigh on impossible thanks to all the fruit and nuts on the top the chocolate is here is a beautifully rich  cocoa solids milk chocolate and frankly its divine smooth and creamy and ever so chocolateythen you get to the almonds and oranges aside from being huge theyre rather tasty in themselves the orange pieces are sweet and chewy and  most importantly  very orangey the almonds add a nice crunch and subtle nutty flavour so despite the fact that theres so much stuff packed in here you can still taste everything as with everything of hollys that ive tasted the quality of ingredients used really shines through its over the top but completely delicioushello chocoblog  happy new year 
from australia courtesy of lucky traveling friends when do i get to go to somewhere warm and exotic this bag purports to contain a luscious combination of whole natural blueberries wrapped in the worlds finest award winning premium dark chocolate typical aussie modesty then ehthe contents are a different matter plump juicy dried blueberries some of them fairly hefty encased in a good quality rich dark chocolate its a fairly simple product no messing about no frills no fancy packaging very australian pop one in your mouth and start to roll it around and oonce the glaze gives way youre treated to a slightly bittersweet dark chocolate which isnt too sugary and holds its flavour well as the blueberry begins to release its tanginessjust as the chocolate is high quality and full of flavour the same goes for the blueberries plump slightly tart fruit which bursts with flavours cleaning your mouth of the last vestiges of chocolate and making you reach for another one almost immediately the combination is dreadfully moreish im afraid to say despite my best efforts the bag didnt last more than a few days once opened and i didnt share these at all  this is one of  those classic deadly combinations presented in a form that just lends itself to that whole ooh just a couple more thing that is the downfall of us all at one time or anotherobviously id like proof of these awards and a little more information from noosa via their web site but when it came to the vital taste test they came through with flying colours if anyones headed that way id love another bag or twogday from australianoosa is a town in queensland on the sunshine coast its famous for its beaches and access to the great barrier reef i havent heard of the company before and ive roamed the country quite a bit so it strikes me as very boutique  especially considering our major supermarket chains go to some pains to stock products like this from the state theyre in i might have to check it out at some point or at least send a friend to do so 
the mms are a bit bigger than usual to accommodate both the peanut butter and chocolate inside the candy shell i thought they might be using whole peanuts but instead the filling has the same texture and taste of well peanut butter there are three colors brown red and a golden yellow specked in red that reminds me of an easter egg which reminds me is there a special occasion for this special edition maybe i only ask that because its the holiday season but a strawberry candy in winter seems random unless its been on the shelves for a while without me seeing it still the red stripes on the wrapper do remind me of a candy cane even if strawberry peanut butter sounds nothing like christmas coincidence or am i just reading into it too muchwith all this in mind i went on to the tasting true to the strawberried name the most focus goes to the strawberry flavor unfortunately it is an artificial strawberry taste next is the peanut butter which is as far from a real peanut taste as most peanut butters are not any worse than all of them i think you can taste the chocolate maybe just barely its even further than the sidelines the extra size of the mms makes the crunch of their shells even better as your teeth sink down through the filling layersits all a sort of peanut butter and jelly feel since i can make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich anytime i wouldnt mourn these mms if they left the shelves forever neither would i wish them good riddance i like them id get them again id recommend them to mm lovers but i wouldnt call them a must trythey were originally a special edition for the transformers ii movie they had different packaging when they were released in the summer httpwwwtypetivecomcandyblogitemlimitededitionstrawberriedpeanutbuttermmsi tried these a couple of months ago i am always a sucker for trying new products i love mms but i would never buy these again i didnt know what the main flavor was but i didnt get any sense of it being strawberry i did get the peanut butter flavor but that was pretty artificial tasting too the best part is the typical candy shell and the hint of chocolate youd think i would learn one of these days that the only mm variance worth buying are the dark varieties but i will probably keep trying each and every variation mm mars comes out withmy kids would probably love theseomg this combination sounds vile hope theres mms peanut butter wo strawberry p
ganong might not be the best known name outside canada but they can make a pretty credible case for inventing the chocolate bar back in the late s and were also the first company to sell heartshaped boxes of chocolates for valentines day in north america these days ganongs focus might be boxed chocolates but they are thankfully still selling what must be their signature product  chicken bones for the uninitiated chicken bones are pink cinnamon candies filled with dark bittersweet chocolate and they are really quite unique and very addictive the name comes from their long thin shape which is reminiscent of their namesakes especially because of that darker corethey have a healthy kick of cinnamon too they arent quite up there with those little cinnamon hearts that appear every valentines day but theres enough of it to leave a satisfying posteating tingle in your mouth afterwards the sweetness of the candy is nicely balanced out by the bitterness of the chocolate which has a grainier texture than most people might be used to but it works really well in this context they stand up to a variety of eating styles too they can quite happily be crunched into a nice simultaneous mixture of chocolate and cinnamon or sucked more slowly so that the chocolate is gradually released from its spicy shell either way youll end up with a bright pink tongue as your badge of honour and isnt that the important thingthey are available all year round but tend to be easier to find at christmas when they appear in the gift boxes shown in the photos in addition to the bag of chicken bones ganong also include a couple of pieces of their milk chocolate which is kind of forgettable after the feature presentation i usually pick up the smaller bags instead because otherwise ill keep eating until they are all gonehow bizarrethere is a place in new york state that creates something called turkey joints that are somewhat similar theyve been making them for about  years and theyve become quite famous nation wide but theyre only available from a small candy store called candy land its sugarmolasses hard candy shell filled with dark chocolate and almondsoh these do look good and i love their quirky namethese sound delicious  ive never heard of this company beforethis canadian company is very close to my hometown  we grew up with these candies and still enjoy them today  thanks for the blogi really want to eat this kind of candiesbut i am from chinaso i just have heard its name and they are not saled in chinaso pityif have chancei want to have a trychicken bones were a tradition in our christmas stocking growing up  still love themwe are new brunswickers  now living in calgary ab we get so excited when care packages are sent from home knowing ganong chicken bones and red wrap chocolates are  inside a real childhood memory passed down the generations we love all of it and keep looking for it out hereplease head west 
so what did my s worth of handcrafted chocolate bar taste likethe white chocolate itself was very rich and creamy almost a mere two or three shades away from thick clotted cream it was sweet but not too sweet the thyme was peppered randomly throughout the bar making each piece i broke off slightly different some had quite a lot of thyme and some had very little with the majority being in between the two extremes you could definitely feel the thyme in every piece and it was a core ingredient of the overall taste of the barthe initial flavour combination could only really be described as intriguing  is it sweet is it savoury it is herbal is it all those things the thyme definitely added a refreshing savoury kick but i didnt find it overwhelming  the sweetness and thymeness seemed perfectly balanced making the bar very palatable indeedi couldnt quite decide what i felt about this bar but i knew one thing for sure  it was really rather moreish  i felt i needed another piece to accurately describe the flavour then another then another before i knew it the whole thing was gone oopswhile this bar is somewhat out there on the chocolate flavour combination range i would certainly recommend it its offers a very interesting combination of flavours youre not likely to come across all too oftenthis sounds right up my alley for pure chocolate ill always choose dark but i adore finding interesting flavour combinations in white and milk chocolate and i love thyme as an herbwow this sounds wonderfully flavorful i love the idea of thyme and rich white chocolate thanks for sharing
the geeks in the audience may find the idea of ubuntu chocolate mildly amusing because ubuntu is best known as the most popular flavour of the linux operating system the word is zulu in origin and roughly translated means togetherness and the concept of being connected to others so it fits quite well with the concepts of free open source software and as it turns out ethically produced chocolatepersonally its just a little too strong for my liking the orange and nutmeg flavours are still there and initially the chocolate has a pleasant taste not unlike a nice mulled wine but as the clove flavour builds it just becomes too strong  and then it hangs around long after the other flavours are goneim looking forward to tasting the ginger bar because thats one flavour i just cant overdose on but this one was just a little too clovey for mehmmm  clove and chocolate  ive never had that combination and am not sure i want to waste the carbs on itim pretty sure id love the clove flavour but why must so many dark chocolates have orange in them fiddlesticksthis sounds a bit like green  blacks maya gold bar but with the added twist of cloves i love the flavour of cloves so this would probably be a winner with me
were not told the cocoa content of this particular bar but in the light of the other ingredients it really doesnt matter as you bite into this chocolate you begin to appreciate that  is quite a bit sweet chocolate and dessicated coconut release their flavours and a hint of bnana creeps in its only towards the end of the whole business that you begin to get the curry its subtle at first but eat a couple of pieces and wait a minute or so as i breathed out i caught a whiff of turmeric and a hint of spice a couple of squares later and the curry flavour is in full effect mingling with the lighter fruit flavours to create an interesting and not unpleasant blend of sweet and spicethis is the sort of thing ive come to thing of as surprise chocolate its the here try this you wont believe it sort of chocolate that people ask you about from time to time its a potential answer to the whats the weirdest chocolate youve ever tasted question not unpleasant well balanced and well executed but theres no way youd hunt this down as a regular nibble is therefull marks for ingenuity and boundarypushing though i can think of a few people ill be offering this to in the coming daysoooh im a fan of theos coconut curry bar and vosges naga bar so would love to try this may just be forced to add germany to the upcoming europe travel itinerary
now i truly believe that you can tell a lot about a chocolate by the color of its foil this gold foil is too yellow it spells out cheaper to me set it aside and you have a thick bar that breaks into five chunks the white eggnog filling looks just as frightening as id imagined a gooey watery pasty mess sitting inside the chocolate you cant pick up any smells from it either just from the chocolate it doesnt taste the most like eggnog either there are some faint christmas spices cinnamon and nutmeg in there but theres so much sugar as well the sugar along with the watery goos texture is too distracting the milky flavors come in more from the average milk chocolate which is quite thick to be able to combat the gooi will give the bar this it does get better as you keep eating tasting the christmas spices with the sweet chocolate is nice enough it is very greasy though which doesnt work well with eating moreas simply an alright chocolate i dont see why it should get away with costing more than another candy bar just because its an attempt at a novelty item honestly if novelty is splendids focus cant they do better than an okay chocolate that tastes a little like eggnog stuck in a poinsettia wrappercomments are closed
they obviously use a similar manufacturing process as the fruchocs because these are also little round balls of heaven  amazingly consistent in size and shape each is about  inch roughly  cm diameter  not perfectly formed looking a bit like the common chocolate sultanas you can get anywhere  and which i can scarf down by the handful but thats another storyso whats to like the chocolate is milk fairly sweet and very moreish and there is a very generous amount of it the turkish delight centre isnt squelchy or excessively sticky  it packs a whacking punch of the rosewater flavour and each little ball is just the right size to ensure you cant stop at one or two or tenand whats to not like only one thing  the bag isnt big enoughnow fortunately for me the rest of the family dont like turkish delight much  which makes more for me i took great pains to eat these slowly  over a period of oh about  minutes not really  i made them last a couple of days but i did have a terrible accident i started eating  just to get a taste  and before i knew it i had a disaster on my hands id polished all but three or four before taking a photo thats why the bag looks flat in the picture oopsas the lolcats might say oh noes  bag iz empty cos i did eated demim in love  i cant believe its taken me all this time to find you chocablog i am sitting here debating in my own mind on christmas morning whether i prefer darryl lea or haighs scorched almonds haighs wins and then i stumble on the blog of my dreams it rocks being the only person in the house who loves turkish delight  me too the tackier the packaging the betteri love turkish delights  and it this definitely makes me ponder what chocolate covered turkish delights would taste likeim with janice the chocolate covered turkish delight must be devine
so here we have half a dozen rococo chocolates which you may or may not be able to buy in the near futuremy first was this milk chocolate disc adorned with a light sweep of gold  i had been told that it was a chestnut chocolate but i had no idea what was inside it turned out that the filling was a combination of a chestnut flavoured jelly layer topped with a fullflavoured milk chocolate it was smooth sweet and tangy with a full rounded set of flavours from both chocolate and chestnut similar to but way beyond caramel i thought it was a great balance of flavoursnext up was a fig chocolateanother chocolate with two layers a nutty praline filling complimented the surprisingly powerful fig perfectly i really did enjoy it a lot and i was a little surprised to find such a small piece of fig giving out so much flavourthis rather attractive dark chocolate was home to some fruitinessmore liquid and much lighter on the palate than jam the jelly filling packed a light fragrant flavour i believe quince was mentioned in the shop but nobody was too sure it definitely had a soft sweetness to it not the more tart flavours one normally associated with berries the dark chocolate had great texture and just the right degree of bitterness before the sweeter flavours blended into the overall tastei stayed with the dark chocolates for the next one  a coconut ganachei really liked the look of this one that coconut layer seemed to promise soft lush flavours it didnt disappoint  creamy and whisper light it held tiny fragments of coconut and when it blended with the chocolate in the base my mouth was treated to one of the best coconutchocolate pairings i think ive ever had a definite winnernumber five was a sour cherry chocolate and cutting it turned out not to have been the best idea luckily i was cautious and avoided disastera sticky tart filling bursting with cherry fruit flavours and not a hint of perfume  lovely just the right balance of tart and sweet to prevent any nosewrinkling and a great pairing with the thin rich dark chocolate the cherry filling seems to echo the darker burnt notes of the chocolate and once the filling has dissolved away the remaining chocolate provides a lovely cocoa finishmy final treat was a truffle truffle yes someone has had a go at combining the earthy rooty taste of everyones favourite posh fungus with premium chocolate i was intrigued  another first was about to happenthe centre was dark and dense and did indeed deliver an earthy dusky truffle flavour along with the rich dark cocoa flavours this was one of those truffles that just evaporate slowly spreading their flavours all over your mouth before slipping away light as a feather once id finished enjoying the dark chocolate shell bittersweet rich tangy cocoa i was left with a slightly earthy rootlike aftertaste mingled with the chocolate it was unusual not unpleasant but there again most definitely not to every taste its one of those adventurous chocolates that might be around for a while then disappear or become an occasional rarity either way worth a try but you wouldnt but a dozen to take home all at oncethis is my first encounter with rococos fresh chocolates and i have to say i am suitably impressed with almost a quarter of a century its obvious that chantal coady and her team are well practiced in the art of producing fine quality chocolates my only regret is that its taken me this long to be able to sample some of them ill be interested to see which of these make it out into the shops as wellsounds like some lovely unique flavours there expecially the fig one  never seen that before i love the pictures with the cross sections as well very droolworthy itd be great to get any feedback on what you think of the website hope you like itlove the closeup macro photos youve taken here the chocolates look so tasty
which would be the ampamakia made with beans from madagascar this one is more rich and deep still with fruitiness its stronger in taste it melts just beautifully it reminds me of a foamy latherthird is the gran couva in a light cream box its origin is trinidad i thought it had the most robustlooking color out of the three just a bit deeper it was also my favorite out of them still gentle and chocolatey at the low  its chocolate flavors are more earthy its a bit grittier than pretty even all at the same cacao percentage the bars keep up their individuality soft and sweet deep cocoa and fruit and earthy all nicely done as wellthen we have two flavored bars ill be reviewing the plain grand crus separately so i wont go into too much detail about the chocolate itself until thenthe manjari orange just happens to be another  with orange flavored nuggets lovely ingredients for those sugar orange puree apple pineapple fibers thickener acidity regulator and natural flavor okay that list doesnt encourage me i can never get chocolate and orange together the orange taste here is fairly throughout the chocolate which seems just at the right level to go along with it its a sweeter taste when you get to those sugary orangeapplepineapple bits which have too much of a jelly candy taste as orange chocolates go though i suppose its pleasant mostly because the chocolate is so good but im waiting for someone to win me over to the chocolateorange idea and it hasnt happened yeton the other hand the guanja grue i do very much like its a  dark chocolate with nibs lots of them there are plenty of nut chocolates that have less nuts than this bar has nibs theyre flavorful too with their wonderful blueberry taste their flavors combine seamlessly with the chocolate making it difficult to say how much each is contributing usually nibs have a much sparser presence im really enjoying the command they have here you can get the sophisticated flavors while still casually crunching your chocolate i dont feel wasteful chewing it this time either since i have a whole other plain bar waiting for me all in all a great showing from valrhona i never liked chocoorange until i had dark chocolate dipped orange peel more zesty less sweet leonidas does a fine one although if you can get your hands on the lemon peel instead thats the best one really kind of a revelationlove love love the plain manjarii just reviewed the  vintages of these estate grown bars on my blog myself and i agree with you that all three are delicious and easy chocolates to eat with the gran couva also being my favourite ive tried a few of the plain grand cru bars have reviewed the jivara pecan and after your review am planning to pick up the guanaja grue soon i do love nibs sadly though i also dont get orange and chocolate so shall be passing on that one not all of us get the luxury of having our chocolate sent to us d doh i should try theseif you want to try another chocolateorange combo theo makes a good one i think its just called dark chocolate with orange it uses orange oil so the citrus combines with the chocolate flavors rather than having distracting candied bits of orange peel sitting around
i was very pleased to have a visit from some friends who had recently been to australia and singapore and they were kind enough to source me a few items for us to try together after dinner from australia this rocklea road is made by darrell lea a family owned company who have been producing confectionery for over eighty yearsthe bar its considerably more than a bar more like a tray full is made up of a peanut and toasted coconut base topped with ridiculously large fluffy sticky marshmallows which are then toped off with a milk chocolate that containes  cocoa slolidsjust have a look at thisnow unless you have a peanut allergy hate coconut or cannot abide anything sweet in which case why are you reading chocablog youre probably wishing you had a piece of this next to you right now especially if its a little before lunchtime and youre reading this because youre bored i can think of several people who are going to be monstering this up for me very soontaste wise the base is rather good the toasted coconut is plentiful and so are the peanuts in fact the whole thing is plentiful its almost cartoon like in its overthetopness the sort of ludicrously large treat a comic book character tucks into at the end of an episode personally im somewhat on the fence when it comes to whole peanuts and chocolate i just think there are better nuts to partner chocolate what inevitably happens is that you get through the sweet gooey marshmallow and nibble you way through the coconut and chocolate base which is almost biscuitlike and then end up with a bit of chocolate and a mouthful of very bland peanuts its almost like having to atone for all the fun you just had by eating something healthy straight afterwardshaving said that i did rather enjoy the piece i had and not just for the wow factor i couldnt ever see myself eating this again in fact i pretty much know where its going to end up but as i said there are plenty of people who would take one look at this and want it  allunfortunately not available in the uk as far as im aware it would make a fantastic centrepiece for a childs party or great sleepover munchies im sure aussie kids love emnow that does look like some pure yumminessdelicious rocklea road can you get it in the uk  best ever deliciousoooooh yeah baby dthis lil aussie chick didnt come across them until adulthood the joys of living in rural oz and loves em which is weird because i dont ususally like rocky road in general as i find it a bit too sweet but this this i likei love the darryl lea rocklea road they also do the best red licorice ive found anywhere and although their chocolate is super sweet it goes nicely with their scorched almonds yes im visiting my oz home town for a week and currently binging like you wouldnt believe on all my old chocolate favsim confused  you say you enjoyed it but i couldnt ever see myself eating this again in fact i pretty much know where its going to end up what does that meanim not a huge fan of australian chocolate but i do love rocklea road it is completely ott and scooby snackesque and the textures and flavour are indulgent perfection now in three flavours dark choc milk and whitewhat i meant was the pieces i had were fun in an ott way but ill probably never buy one of these overly sugared monstrosities again or something like thatim an aussie girl and growing up with probably a delicasy rocky road its the best fricken rocky road in the world well except for mine of course but far out it good i dont have any problems with the whole nuts in fact i think it adds to the amazingness of it you really dont notice the nuts until you start crunching it and even then you want morehallelua for mr quinn and rocklea road
walmart is filled with controversy yet despite their questionability they do have an impressive chocolate selection these days the usual averages are there but so are some nicer brands id never heard of hageland a belgian company before the five or so bars on the shelf looked worth giving a try i came away with just the first one to get my attention it was all about the picture  not your usual chocolate cover i wish they said something about it though did they just think it looked cool or is it an artifact from costa rica where the trinitario cacao is from anyway for a first try  is a good place to start the rainforest alliance stamp implies that hageland is a serious company as does the nojunk ingredients list of cocoa mass sugar cocoa butter and vanillathe flavor is a bit bitter but tempered with plenty of cocoa notes the spice is even held down by some shy sweetness hiding in the dark it has a good mouthfeel as well im rather liking it i cant decided whether i should call it simple or bold so turning to the back of the box part of the description calls it a delightfully traditional smooth dark chocolate traditional encapsulates it the simplicity comes from going for a chocolate format that works while the boldness comes from the enjoyable flavors traditional not averageits certainly nice to find something like this in a place like walmart where you can actually find it without going out of your way this bar seems like itll appeal to a variety of dark chocolate lovers i dont know what the limited selection on the front means though maybe youll need to hurry if you want to try itsee fons comment below about the brand  which is crafted by a belgian manufacturer and sold by walmart i was afraid they had discontinued it a few months ago when i couldnt find any but last month they had some morei discovered hageland chocolate at walmart my favorite is costa rica but either they dont carry that one any longer or someone always beats me to it where else can i find ithttpwwwhagelandchocolatecomhageland is a branddevelopped exclusively for walmart  it is the name of a small rural regio east from brussels between the small towns of leuven aarschottienen and diest  thats the reason why our factory name is not mentioned on the productswe are one of the largest artisan manufacturers in belgium and we are known for our top quality products  we are working in probably the greenest chocolate factory in europe  our energy comes for  from our own nearly  solar panels and the rest is bought from only natural sources like hydro solar and windat this moment we do work very hard on sustainability issuesi recently stumbled on this chocolate through a friend who bought some for fathers day and happened to notice the the name was spelled close to mine  my huband i believe is from hungry  interesting  where does the hageland come fromlindaplease please where can we buy that wonderful chocolate bar  it is the best  rita huston   i live in nh and now walmart does not carry it anymore  any other place to buy itits back at walmart how can i get somthing like this in my store i love how it looks on the shelf can care less what it is people love it i know its just for walmart but is there any that they make that looks like this that other stores can salealso i was surprised to find chocolate this good at walmart as good as any ive had inccluding lindt and scharffen barger on top of  that the bar was reasonable priced around  each they also have peru and uganda varieties but this was the best with an intensity more than a boldness if you see some buy a few plus its not at every wal mart just the super wal marts as far as i can telldecent high end dark bar  i bought it  a clearance place so walmart may be dropping it  hope the company does wellhello i stumbled apon this site just seeing about information on hageland chocolate i am in the processe of trying chocolates to try and get a good feel of what i would use and offer in my shop once openedi too agree that this chocolate is nice diffrentnot used to finding realy good chocolate in my store i work at a super center for now and a good price im the person who would pay just about any price for good quality chocolateon a side noat ive been thinking on ordering some callebaut chocolate as sofar it seems well balanced and at roughly  to ish a pound reasonableanyway to the chocolatei have tried all three costa rica uganda and peru and all are very nice easy melting nice snap very well temperedand no added crap i hate added crap well anyway each was indeed diffrent a diffrent mouth feel and if i do say so the chocolate didnt leave a burnt or overly bitter after taste like some other chocolatetheres only one thing to do now see if i can purches the chocolate in larger amountsany one know where i can order  lbs at a time block or wafer is fine by mehmm all in all a very nicly balanced chocolate in my opinionim not a fan of behemoth suppliers like walmart but amazon does now carry some varieties of this chocolate oddly now named cachetit is a brand of our company for premium chocolate products we sell in supermarkets  the hgeland brand is a kind of private label brand we created for walmartwhere in omaha ne can hageland be bought as it has disappeared off their shelves and new stock hasnt appeared since new packagingso who else carrys it and what does the wrapper look like those of us who got hooked on this hageland premium belgian dark chocolate barwhat are we to do   where can we find it other than in a wrapper for walmart on ebayyou may find it in most wholefoods stores under the wholefoods brand together with a milk chocolate based on cocoa beans from madagascar a milk and dark organicfair for life chocolate tablet made form cocoa beans from a special project in tanzania and supporting our school project over there a milk caramel  sea salt and a dark pear  roasted almondsalso have a look around for the cachet version of these products but they do not have yet good distributionif hgeland tablets would have remained on the shelf those prices would have gone up as well  we are moving with all of our products to more sustainable sourcing which means we pay more for cocoa beans  that makes the products more expensive but helps many thousands of farmers and their familiesyou can still buy this large bar at the walmart near easton pa  i just bought it today  does anyone know if it is slave free chocolatei have not found the others that you recommendedis there any chance the hageland bar will be back at walmartthey are sold in most of the wholefoods storeswalmart wil shortly start to sell in quite a lot of stores a  oz tablet of hgeland dark chocolate and in some stores also a dark with almonds tablet  the product will arrive in the next couple of days in the harbor and from then on it will take another  weeks to get it through the system and into the storesis walmart going to carry the oz bar of dark chocolate anymorewhich wal mart stores in omaha ne carry it as no one at the surrounding stores seem to know let alone know anything about the chocolate and its namei just ate the last of my hageland bar  glad to hear well soon find it again in wal mart stores  i hadnt found a replacement  no whole food stores nearthis format will be replaced by a smaller  oz version  will be in stores any oment now
the same goes for the contents inside are  rather dull looking caramel chocolates wrapped in equally dull plasticunfortunately that dullness carries through to the caramels themselves the  milk chocolate coating is bland and barely even tastes of chocolate theres no vegetable fat in the chocolate but its mainly sugar and thats exactly what it tastes likethe caramels themselves arent much better theyre hard and chewy and very like the jawbreaking caramels you get in a quality street tin the flavour is passable but theres a slightly odd plasticy aftertaste that i cant quite put my finger on its certainly not what i would call waitrose qualityaccording to the ingredients theyre made from glucose syrup sugar condensed milk butter and vegetable fat emulsifier fatty acids and salt thats an awful lot of ingredients for some very average caramelsthese are a world apart from the kinds of caramels youd find in any decent chocolate shop and im a little baffled how they ended up on the shelves of an upmarket supermarket like waitrose one to avoidcomments are closed
chocolate orange has been around forever since the s apparently and you cant argue with that sort of longevity over time weve seen it turn dark white and now it explodesas someone who remembers the original just tap it unwrap it and share a little luxury tagline i was amused to read the new instruction no more gentle rapping on the table for twenty minutes no terrys acknowledge that the chocolate orange is a bugger to get into father fetch the cricket bat  or indeed dawn french get the roling pinas for the chocolate itself its what youd expect  cocoa sweet run of the mill milk chocolate as beloved by millions of britons it tastes like most of the popular milk chocolate brands probably because theyre all trying to emulate cadburys for milksugarcocoa balance more than likely in that order the popping candy is also quite sweet but does have the promised natural flavours being made of orange and sugar if you like your chocolate sweet and well sweeter then look no furtherchocolate oranges must sell in their squillions they used to be around at christmastime but now theyre just there adding popping candy to the chocolate will just mean they sell more chocolate oranges im sure quite a few people reading this love chocolate orange and who am i to argue with that all i can say is that there is such a lot of much better chocolate out there now that i for one begin to question the point of this sort of chocolate most kids and a lot of adults would disagreei tasted two pieces and gave the rest away enough saidcomments are closed
im a firm believer that when it comes to sweet treats taste should always come first but this chocolate is a bit like a herbal medicine lesson and that might be a good thing but thats not why i buy chocolate i dont want to be walking around my local supermarket and buy something because it has a healthy balance of yin and yang i just want something sweet and yummy i honestly dont care if youve thought about natures elements of thought passion enthusiasm and emotionbecause feeding your imagination chocolate doesnt taste very nicethere are so many flavours going on at the same time that i cant keep up im all for unusual flavours in chocolate green tea works exceptionally well and chilli chocolate is a genius invention but they dont need another flavour alongside them they work on their own so the seductive bar why do the bars all have such stupid gimmicky names with its ginger green tea and goji berries just doesnt work because you cant taste anything but a great big mash up of flavours their yang bar has treats such as ashwagandha gokshura  kapikachu in i wish i knew what they were so i could decide if the flavours went together but as they tasted the same as the other flavours i tried i doubt it a little bit spicy a little bit sour and nothing distinctive going on its a shame because the chocolate itself appears to be good quality and had a lovely shine to it it would taste pretty good if they hadnt messed it up so royallyits not the worst chocolate ive ever had but its just really rather pointless gimmicks are great if youve got a good product but considering feeding your imaginations rrp is an astonishing  for a g bar i certainly wont be buyingpeople have bought me these as presents before and ive always been really disappointed far too many flavours and too gimmicky very expensive for what it is as well the review is spot onbrilliant siany i couldnt agree more on what i want from a chocolate bar so i wont be trying this one but i will just now go polish off a delicious bar i bought at montezumas in spitalfieldsmy favourites are sensual gorgeous  fruityive bought this chocolate many timesits the best chocolate ive tasted so i dont know what every one is being so negative about it for obviously they dont know their chocolate  i mean have you tasted the fruity one yetwell i think you should its amazingalso the packaging is very striking ideal for presentsi say watch this space as this is definately not a gimmicky brand and definately one to watch i introduce to you all  the one  the only makreting team from fyi bars  sophie debbie gill and catherine applausethanks for the comments everyonei do agree that its great to see exciting new flavours on the market but ive tried an awful lot of this chocolate and all of the flavours taste the same theres so much going on in each one that you cant make out any of the flavours its great that a company are highlighting the health benefits of chocolate but for me taste should come firstjim i was leaving this here just to see if any more turned up but yes youd think theyd try to make it slightly less obvious wouldnt youall the above comments came from the same ip address of course im just wondering if anyone from fyi would like to make an official statement on this before i write a nice little post about itall the above comments came from the same ip address of course im just wondering if anyone from fyi would like to make an official statement on this before i write a nice little post about itwow this is actually worse than the whole fiasco that chocablog had with devine not so long agoin spite of the above refuting it seems to me like duck syndrome if it quacks like a duck etcgill needs to send a private email explaining who she is and where she and her colleagues work  allowing the facts to be checked or it will indeed look like a deliberate set upim not sure thats necessary fact is i still stand by my review i didnt like the chocolate i dont think its worth the price and i wont recommend it to anyonehi im probably a bit late adding to the comments but i came upon this site when looking for stockists of the fyi chocolate bars the farm shop where i used to buy it from has closed due to the owner retiring agreed the flavours are an acquired taste but i love the chocolate especially the dreamy bar a little goes a long way  i am not tempted to eat the whole bar in one sitting which is the case with other delicious chocolate i also love green  blacks milk choc so i can make this a treat that lasts  much better for my figure the packaging is lovely too i think its like marmite  there are those who love it and those that hate it but the haters shouldnt disallow the others their viewi was given it as a present and i loved it the dreamy bar with the mix of lemon and geranium rose was delicious i would certainly get it again but perhaps not at  for gwatch the sell buy dates  bought  bars all of which had a mar sticker under under a carefully placed oct  sticker  when i complained and spoke to paul a supposed celebrity chef he gave me some rubbish about a mix up and sent replacements but the replacement bars were out of date as well  i feel conned and surely its illegal to sell out of date food
as you can clearly see these are indeed classic belgian truffles note the ultrathin crisp bittersweet dark chocolate shell feast your eyes on the rich mousselike rich buttery melting filling take a bite of one of these theyre a little large for eating whole and the cocoa dusting hits you with that bitter dark taste before the dark chocolate joins in smoothing away some of the extreme bitterness the filling may appear solid but it is in fact made of clouds cream and cocoa and melts away almost instantaneously flooding the mouth with swirls of creamy rich chocolate flavour as the chocolate filling evaporates away small fragments of the remaining shell release a last hit of dark woody cocoa flavours and the whole thing is rounded off with the remnants of that first taste of dark bittersweet cocoamy only question mark over these truffles is that i see not a single reference to cocoa content or any other ingredients for that matter i think its very important to relay this information knowing gallers range as i do im sure these are top notch in terms of ingredients but nonetheless i find anonymous chocolate somewhat suspectas far as taste goes i dont think thats  its a case of it being too long since i had a decent pack of truffles to enjoy  these really are authentic wonderful belgian truffles i thoroughly enjoyed eating them highly recommended as a special treatcomments are closed
once you get past the rather scary sounding beyond boyle name the man behind the  questionable branding comes across as arrogant and annoying he may in fact be a lovely chap but his own web site doesnt do much to promote that ideadespite my reservations i headed to waitrose to pick up a box thanks to the same textheavy branding as the web site i spotted them on the shelf quite easily then i saw the price introductory offer  thats for a g box of supermarket truffles ouchi very nearly put the box back and walked away but forced myself to hold on to it  and actually pay for iti tried to find the ingredients but with so much text on the box it was difficult to find and when i did mange to locate it it was written in a bizarre flowery and totally unnecessary language scoop of caster sugar drizzle of glucose syrup pinch of sorbitol and for some reason splash of vodkaby the time i came to open the box i was so annoyed with the pretentiousness of it all that i was ready to stab someone luckily mr boyle puts his own photo on the box not once but twice so i was able to relieve some of the stress before getting down to trying the chocolatestastewise theyre pretty good a fact which i found vaguely annoying as youd expect the  cocoa powder dusting is a little bitter and dry but that soon gives way to the sweeter  chocolate shell which then melts away to a rather pleasant truffle filling that actually tastes like real orangesi found myself quite enjoying them  not enough to scoff the whole box the sign of truly great chocolate  but i managed to get through nearly half of them before sitting down to write the reviewin the end its a shame these are so expensive and have such horrible branding theyre nice chocolates but mr boyle has priced himself out of the market and chosen to plaster his product with self promoting nonsense rather keeping things simple for that reason i cant recommend themyikes  how can they possibly justify charging that much and even if they are tasty the whole pinch of sorbitol is enough to make me pick something else upi think the branding is actually quite lovely and makes such a welcome change from the standard red and black packaging with all those ghastly bows eurgh no thanksive also tried the chocolates and they taste incredible the caramelised orange is my favouritethe thing that really makes these truffles stand out is that they fund training courses for people that have experienced homelessness  which it states clearly in a concise paragraph on the back of the boxconsidering most chocolate companies out there apart from divine green  blacks are highly unethical i think these choccies deserve some praisei wasnt sure what sorbitol was but after looking it up its a sugar substitute which occurs naturally in many stone fruits and berries from trees of the genus sorbus not so bad after all ehduh it occurs naturally in fruit and vegetables ive only found out about sorbitol today and i know thatunfortunately it seems you have a very pessimistic view ive taken this from their website and dont see anything about gimmicky workshops rather they are helping people in need to get jobs and sort their livesby providing fantastic work experience and onthejob skills training for people that have experienced homelessness to help propel them into not just full time employment but onto a flourishing career pathour unique programme also provides support training and progression planning for trainees to regain their self esteem belief and confidence needed to accomplish full employability we partner with our parent company beyond boyle ltd who contributes in kind to the foundation and provides the valuable work experience and employment opportunities to the trainees apprentices and graduatesalso you might find this of interestwe dont believe that food or service should be complicated or stuffy nor do we believe that ingredients should travel unnecessarily so we support our local farmers and food producers whenever possible there are times when we want flavours and ingredients from around the world and we always try to trace the source making sure it has been produced to our own ethically high standardsim more than happy to pay a bit more for chocolates that taste amazing and are doing something incredible at the same time those that dont will buy cadburysi was thinking exactly the same thing simonhaha wouldnt mind working for them  but i would get fat they are on the shelves in waitrose i bought a box for my boss for christmashow much  although i do like the packagingi was recently shown this blog and saw the feelings of people that had written in about our chocolatesi have never contributed to a blog as i thought it would be all the brand managers trying to be clever and market themselvesfunnily i see that some have assumed that is the case here but i am afraid not note my late responsethank you for taking the trouble i know how time is precious and i have taken note of all that has been saidthis project started with an idea of expanding our social enterprise further than just inspiring people who have experienced homelessness with fine cooking in our hospitality business we have been running our apprenticeship since october  trained over  people on a back to work program trained over  young vulnerable people to a fresher more fulfilled life through our freshlife pathway and fully employed two people that have previously been constant crack users both have found a new begining for themselvesthis product is a way for us to give people that dont wish to be chefs but want to try something different we dont expect them to want to work with us forever but merely light some kind of fire in their bellies and start some meaniful activitywe have made a product that hopfully tastes great we used our own money to pay for the development design and on shelf costs we had a lot of luck an enormous amount of help and support and of course our gut instinctyes we understand some of the choices or i guess you may call them compromises these were made with much careful concideration for what is the end goal for both the consumer and the brand isi believe you need to make the product speak for itself they were developed in my kitchen so i copied my notes from my recipe book pretty much as i wrote them i want the chocolates to last for people to enjoy as well as feel that the value will last longer than your average short shelf life chocolates thats why i put a touch of vodka in there it helpsthe sorbitol is there because i make fresh pastry and bread in my kitchen its good practice to use it as things like yeast and other ingredients could have an impact i do put a pinch ini would like to say that nearly all our customers believe that what we do is pretty special and they feel great about contributing to it its part of the experiencei work pretty hard but i have time for visits to show anyone around that would spare us the time meet the trainees and have a cuppamy last parting jesture is about my pictures i am so proud of my team and my business that i am prepared to put my face on the box twice i hope it shows some credability as well as my pridehope to hear from you sometime
inside the box are two  gram bars individually clad in brown and lime green its nice to see the design work carry through on the inside im a little puzzled by the logo on the twelve squares though the best i can make out its the initials chl inside a circle chocolate lovers maybe its columbian cacao were dealing with here from the tumaco region if there was only one word i could use to describe this bar it would be smores chocolate and marshmallow are what it reminds me off it hits that line where it isnt sweet it isnt bitter at least not to me  there is a dry taste that gets close and may very well go over the edge for some palates the smooth description is an apt way of putting the balance it finds its funny because its fudgelike while still a serious chocolate you get a taste of both angles which ill repeat is singular for such a high percentageanother chocolate that matches its packaging design well the fun colors paired with the cacao vine at  for the  gram total its also a great deal for a chocolate fixalas i dont think they are carrying this any more and after such a short time and i am heartbroken because i think this is one of the bestif not the bestchocolate bar that tjs has ever carriedlately i could not find them in tjs around the sf bay area either am going to miss them terriblyi agree guys definitely my favorite tjs chocolate and one of the best among all chocolates imho i really hope tj is going to bring this yummy treat backnice post  i see them featuring this in their latest circular so maybe it will appear back in stock to the people who cant find it  i eagerly await trying it out for myself since its a great price for what sounds like an interesting baryech  this chocolate bar was horrid  i can understand why theyd be taking it out of rotation if that was the case  however i just bought and consumed one of these last week so i dont think theyre discontinuing it  shame really  i love dark chocolate i am a dark chocolate lover  and this bar was maybe the only chocolate bar ive ever stopped eating half way through and thrown away  i agree with the review inasmuch as the bar i had wasnt sweet or bitter  in fact it was near flavorless  the experience of chewing it was like eating the tile flooring out of a doll housejames i respect your personal taste however i think you are overreacting to the fact that  you didnt find or appreciate the subtle tones of this chocolate im not a fan of dark chocolate but this one got me precisely because of those delicate fruity subtleties almost like perfume maybe you should try again with no anticipationwhere can i purchase the  chocolate lovers bar in oklahoma i think the chocolate tastes wonderful  i like that it has fiber in it im happy to say my husband didnt like it so i dont have to share it with himthis could be my favorite chocolate ever  has a very tangy fruity flavor and also does melt like butter  and very low sugar  and the price is just amazaing  for  ounces  just an amazing bar  but the title is apt my mom who hates dark chocolate tried it and said it tastes like soap fone of the greats imho i think i prefer it to valrhona that tjs also carries smooth fruity and not overly bitterthe best chocolate bar ever i cannot get enough if iti just picked up a bar two days ago in the nyc union square tjoes it does have a marshmallowey taste i also pick up a little maraschino cherry very tastyim eating a bar right now  i think its excellent for an   ive tried a lot of different chocolate over the years dark and while this isnt the best its really good for a high percentage cocoa   my favorite snacking bar is probably chocolove  bari was curious to read what others thought of this bar when i found your blog i recently tried thedark chocolate lovers bar and love it i am happy to say its available as of june  at least in the phoenix area its dark smooth and not too sweet i normally buy trader joes pack of belgian  dark and will continue to stock that in our pantry along with the espresso pillows i have added the dark chocolate lovers bars to the regular rotation but probably wont leave them out in the open for the general population hubby prefers the  but will eat this one in a pinch while complaining that its too dark as he munches the last square time to find a better hiding placei tried this last night and gave my kids  squares each as  a reward  one had a reflexive response and spit it right out over the table the other gave it more of a shot but then said he didnt like it  my wife couldnt eat it either  anyway my family of  were all shocked at how bitter and gross it was  im the only one that may give this a second go  it really just had no sweetness whatsoever  kind of like the taste of very bitter black coffeethe dark chocolate lovers bar has the best ingredients  for your heart health no milk fats only cocoa butter which is a vegetable oil and a small amount of sugar what is excellent too the price  is fantasticif youre not used to really dark chocolate you need to work your way up start with  more percentage chocolate means less percentage sugar  most people will find this very bitteri found this to be pretty outstanding sweet when compared to a lindt  described as fruity on the package a note of dark cherry comes through before even taking a bite for  i really enjoyed this  a couple of squares at a time
like their raisinonly counterparts these are equally moreish despite knowing better i still havent managed to put the bag downone thing worth noting is that although the bag is the same size as the cadbury raisins bag you only get g here rather than g now im sure thats partly because raisins on their own are heavier than raisins mixed with corn flakes but sneakily both are priced at   making these  more expensive weight for weighteven so  and despite scoffing the raisins in one sitting  id rather have a bag of these theyre just that little bit more interesting dont go thinking of them as proper chocolate though as theyre nothing more than a chocolate flavoured snack food but they fulfil that role quite wellcool we dont have this in manila though sad 
its a square bar very similar in size and shape to the thorntons blocks although this doesnt have the weight printed on the label it cost me  about  which is perhaps a little pricey but these are handmade and hand wrapped blocks so i dont think thats entirely unreasonablethe front of the bar is embossed with the plante chocolat and is rather attractive if a little rough around the edges i think that just adds to the handmade feel and makes it more appealing although the lack of any chunks makes it quite hard to break into bitesized piecesthe chocolate is delicious i dont know where in the world its from but it has a rich earthy flavour with plenty of coffee notes but its also quite sweet and not at all bitter that sweetness is helped by the violet pieces which are quite pleasant but just dont add enough flavour for my likingperhaps its just memories of scoffing whole packets of oversweet parma violets as a child but i was really looking for more of violet hit  here  as much as a delicate flowery taste can be a hit it really is a rather nice chocolate but i found myself wanting just a little more than it could deliveri was quite impressed by the fact that i actually enjoyed all the dark chocolate in the selection box we got on the trip it must be the sweetnessplante chocolat travaille encore le chocolat artisanal et cest pour cette raison que leurs chocolat est tellement bon
the wrapper tells the customer that this chocolate is made from trinitario beans grown in santa domingo in the dominican republic and promises soft spicy cocoa flavoursits fairly sweet and just a shade over half of this bar is indeed sugar of one sort or another as a potential rival for other betterknown milk chocolate bars it shapes up pretty well offering just what was promised  soft slightly spicy cocoa notes sitting in a creamy soft sweet melange of flavours dont let the spicy reference fool you though  this chocolate isnt going to burn your mouth or make small children complainthis choc is the worst choc that ive ever tasted yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk and yuckyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
according to the text on the boxi cant really argue with that because i certainly wouldnt complain if this turned up in my stocking on christmas morning at g its the perfect size to make a bit of an impact without being as overthetop as one of hotel chocolats g slabsthe chocolate as hotel chocolats standard  milk variety and is beautifully molded and glossy in appearance as the blurb suggests the scarf is naturally coloured and flavoured with mixed berries and is quite yummyif i had a complaint it would be that the flavoured area is tiny compared to the rest of this g animal i wouldnt say its painted on but its only a few millimetres thick at the most and its so yummy that there deserves to be more of it maybe a hat next year shoesthe pink choice might be a bit odd but as long as the flavor is good any color will do  one of these days i will have the opportunity to try this brand
guest chocablogger natasha faria is back with a selection from south africafirst off  the butterfly i should mention that white chocolate is my nemesis if its white its not righthowever this is quite a nice little chocolate the white chocolate is crisp and very sweet and creamy  as i suppose all white chocolates are the centre taste like a milk chocolate ganache  very creamy and extraordinarily but not sickly sweet it could be a caramel ganache in a white chocolate shell but i may be overly influenced by the shell  which is a little too thick for my liking judging by the design and combination of flavours i would judge this to be something perfect for that lady in your life who likes sweet things but not necessarily chocolatey thingsnext up the almond surprise i love the nut and chocolate combination and this is quite divine a milk chocolate ganache in a dark chocolate shell with roasted almonds covering it the almonds set off the creamy ganache perfectly while the dark chocolate and almonds work in unison to stop this from being too sweet while not taking anything away from the chocolate experiencethe crisscrossing chocolate is a wonderful surprise truffle  coconut fudge in a milk chocolate shell although the coconut is not apparent visually you can begin tasting it from the moment you sink your teeth into the fudge the fudge is lovely also  dark and decadent overtones give way to light sugary almost syrupy taste and it is not so dense that it overpowers the coconut the shell is a perfect accompaniment with the white sugar adding a little bit of light sweetness to the dark fudgy flavour a real winnerthe cake truffle is another interesting one  a milk chocolate shell covers a milk chocolate ganache on which caramelised sugar is sprinkled remember the largegrained sugar that came in different colours that your mom used to sprinkle on cupcakes and occasionally if you were good your porridge in the morning theyre rather like that i think this is the kind of chocolate meant to be eaten in one bite so that all the flavours can combine and if eaten in that manner the enormous white chocolate cap is not too disgusting i love the combination of chocolate ganache and sugar  similar in texture relationships to the almond surprise but sweeter a lovely stocking filler for aspiring chocolate connoisseursalso in the selection was a truffle very similar to the cake truffle milk chocolate shell milk chocolate ganache white chocolate drizzle but oh wonder of wonders little pieces of honeycomb interspersed with little pieces of nut unidentifiable nut but nut nonetheless again with the textures so i wont go into that but quite a sweet chocolate however i wouldnt take this and the cake truffle  theyre too similar and the difference between the caramelised sugar and the honeycombnut combination is negligiblei was saving this last icing sugar coated truffle for last as i thought it could only hold good things however it holds a white chocolate ganache yucky however that being said the ganache is so light that it makes me wonder if raw eggs were beaten into it it really is the most tasty white ganache ive had  sweet and creamy but not completely offensive together with the milk chocolate shell and icing sugar dusting its altogether too sweet for my liking but thats what you get when someone else picks for you overall i think that the chocolates are a good buy  and would make a fantastic gift for any woman or women in your life my dislike of white chocolate is not an accurate representation of the quality of their chocolates and i would recommend that you drop past and allow yourself to be seduced as a huge fan of the brand i was delighted to see this review the chocolates are superb and my personal favourite is the champagne truffle unintentionally reviewed here as the one with the icing sugar im a regular at the sandton and eastgate branches where the friendly staff are always more than happy to help see me on my way with an enormous box of my favouritesreally love the chocolates but the customer service received is patheticas for the chocolates are devinegreat article however can i point out some innacuracies of the article firstly that the person who served you was not the manager  the managers are very helpful and passionate about their chocolates and would have given you details on each and every chocolate had you asked the contents of each one further more majority of the chocolates do have some form of label in the window we got a bit sick of each customer asking what each one was  so the managers make sure that many of the choclates are named  so if you paid attention you would have been able to correctly identify each one in your articlethirdly the butterfly is a hazelnut praline and as  marzipan points out the yucky one to which you refer is infact a champagne truffle one of my personal favs the one with the roasted almonds is also a hazelnut praline truffle rolled in roasted almonds the other three are new since my departure so i cannot comment on them i used to work in the all the brances apart from cresta so can confidently say that i know the company and the chocolates very well having worked for them for  yearssasha  i cannot agree more on the customer service  it is rather pathetic  but then again all the shops i go into in south africa i receive shocking customer service  or should i say a lack of customer service so i would not let customer service be a reflection on the chocolates or the ownerskathy  i guess david is an acquired taste maybe like white cholocate  i certainly never had any issues with him maybe he was just having a bad day with a rude customeri would like to thank mark and eileen for being an inspiration as im now too making my own chocolates for weddings and for giftshi ginger trufflethanks for reading my article and i am glad that you enjoyed it however it is important to me that you understand my knowledge of the contents of these chocolates was purposefully absent i wanted the chocolates to speak for themselves as suggesting a flavour by labelling or discussing the chocolate means that the taster is more likely to find that flavour present therefore my ignorance was purposeful  not because i didnt pay attention or because i didnt bother to ask  the products should speak for themselvesi am certain that the owners of geldhof are inspired individuals with a vision  which does not necessarily extend to every branch as it is impossible for them to oversee all of them bad customer service is almost always a result of bad training or a bad attitude the brass only have control over one of thosegood luck with your chocolate business  by now it must be huge let me know where i can find some of your chocolatesregardsshop at least once a week for a few choclates diabetic and normal anf have always been well treated that you for the good service  and great choclates amelia
being a bit of an apple fan it was obviously the packaging that caught my eye here almost exactly the same size and shape as an ipod nano imod comes in seven flavours and even has a play on the old thing different slogan what more could a fan boy ask fori purchased a chilli and a banana flavoured imod but really had no idea what was inside the colourful boxes as it turns out the chocolate itself is equally coolthe ipod like design is carried on to the bar itself although the nature of this kind of coursegrained chocolate isnt ideal for molding into fancy patterns the screen and the cocoa bean click wheel are clearly visible though it may look a little dull in the photos but the individual grains of sugar sparkle in the light making it really quite pretty  but youll have to take my word for thatat  each theyre not cheap but theyre fun tasty and unusal the perfect stocking filler for the apple fan  chocolate lover in your life this christmasbased on my deangelis experience id say these look like something i might have to findnot sure about the banana mindace reveiw dom thanks
the selection they sent is one of those boxes that almost looks too good to eat almost the chocolates are incredibly pretty and it is clear that these handmade chocolate are put together with a great deal of care and love they use fresh natural ingredients  nothing artificial at all  and the box comes with a recommendation to eat it within  days not an issuethe chocolates are rather small not quite making it to the point of being two bites although it makes for a nice healthy mouthful and despite their compact size there is a lot packed into these little squares so it isnt necessarily a bad thing just an observationthe top five from the selection i was sent wereand the restall in all a very impressive collection although some of the flavours were just a bit too subtle for me because it appears that sometimes id rather be slapped across the face with flavour rather than gently hugged but when everything comes together as it does most of the time the results are just quite wonderful theres nothing too startling or new here but the good ones are so well executed that ill probably be crossing paths again with chocolatas sooner rather than later how cute is the ladybug agree with callum  these look fantastici love seeing beautifully presented chocolates like these they dont sound half bad eitheroh wow they are so beautiful btw i love yor blog
but first some background about this bar the chocolate beans chosen for this bar apparently come from a remote savannah in peru like the citrus bar the fruity bar relies solely on the flavourful overtones of the particular type of bean used rather than the addition of any form of actual fruitin this case however the beans do seem to pack plenty of flavour that seems to mature in your mouth as you bite into the chocolate giving it a definite berry finish the blurb lists cherry and raspberry with a raisin finish while i couldnt quite taste the raisin i did definitely get the cherry feel with a hint of the tartness of raspberrythe chocolate itself while dark was actually quite creamy  almost like milk chocolate in consistency tough obviously still darktasting and so a bit too bitter for mewhile i couldnt completely shake my dislike of everything dark chocolate my more openminded friend did enjoy this bar out of the two we tried this one definitely won hands downgroovy packagingagree with ben love the packaging and im intrigued by the idea on relying on the bean flavour rather than adding any fruit am quite tempted by the sound if it fab review
as you can see the packaging is very pretty and that bow is lovely but if youre giving these as a christmas present its worth remembering that nothing says i love you like a box of supermarket chocolates and theres no escaping the waitrose branding herebut what exactly are truffle boulesinside the colourful shell is a layer of dark chocolate with the truffle mixture inside that the chocolate is only  cocoa solids but this is more about the the other flavours and textures than the chocolate itselfthe truffle is thick and slightly chewy but it works well i think a lighter filling may have been a little disappointing after crunching through the sugar shell once you get past that initial crunchy sweetness the favours become much more subtle too the orange flavour is pleasant but i particularly like the cherry flavour which has hints of marzipan and christmas pudding it really is rather nicethese are really just posh sweeties though leave a few bowls of them around at christmas parties and i dont think youll get any complaints ill certainly be picking up some morecuteness
i wont make it a secret i like twilight i wont get into the reasons why i like the booksmovies lets just say that its great when two worlds collide as chocolate and twilight collide in this version of a sky bar i might still try to defend myself by explaining that i didnt personally buy these bars as they were given to me but its probably worse that someone would know id appreciate receiving them so lets just get on with the review shall wethree is the number of the day there are three different wrappers each featuring either bella edward or jacob then there are three segments to each bar with peanut butter creme and caramel fillings ive never had a regular sky bar i dont think ive even seen one  its faith only that lets me believe they still exist but it seems that here is where this version is a little different the original has four flavors caramel vanilla peanut and fudge im guessing the creme and peanut butter are the same as the vanilla and peanut dont know why they cut out the fudge thoughthe sky bar has an interesting concept  different flavors in one are nice it tricks you into feeling like you have more even though its still just one bar so im glad to see a nearly obsolete average candy make a brief comeback with pop culture because really no ones buying these for whats inside the wrappercomments are closed
ive always had a soft spot for chocolate coated raisins but i dont think ive seen a bag as big as this before g in a supposedly resealable bag that doesnt actually work and forces you to eat them all in one sitting cadbury are evilthey taste like any other chocolate raisins you might find sweet chewy and fruity  with the occasional tiny piece of seed that makes you think youve broken a toothof course theyre incredibly moreish so even if the whole resealable bag thing had worked theyd still have been gone within ten minutesas youd expect the chocolate is standard cadbury fare complete with vegetable fat unfortunately it also has a shellac coating which makes the raisins sticky and slightly unpleasant to touch ive never been a particular fan of shellac on chocolate and in my opinion makes the tiny suitable for vegetarians logo on the packet a little questionablebut if thats not a problem for you then theres no denying cadbury raisins are rather tasty  im not sure ill be buying them again but thats mainly down to the fact that they come in such a huge bag that i would be forced to eat by myselfpointless adj serves no useful purpose chocolate in a resealable bag is pointlessbut in my experience cadbury could make them much nicer than the restthey dontwow
inside the box are a multitude of tiny chocolates with a banana flavoured sugar shell now i have always had a problem with artificial fruit flavours  particularly strawberry and banana which always seem to come out tasting like perfume  and so i was somewhat trepidatious about these little yellow fellows however my fears were unfounded as the shells contain enough banana flavour to let you know youre eating a sweet banana but not enough to make you think youve just been dosed with some sort of banana flavoured chemical the shells are thin crisp and not overly sweet with a suitably restrained amount of banana flavouring the chocolate actually gets to make itself known and the overall balance of flavours is pretty good i couldnt say what percentage of cocoa is in the chocolate but judging from the taste its in the high s or low  percentobviously were not talking fine chocolate here these are fun sweets for japanese children and theyre devilishly moreish to boot it doesnt take too long to go from full rattley box to last few bananas in the palm of your hand and in spite of myself i found myself wishing i had more to hand i like the packaging the box reminded me of the old paynes poppets packaging and i think the flavour is done well a shame we dont have more fun chocolate like this for british kids to munch on maybe someone should start a business importing japanese chocolate into the ukim a strange one  ive always loved that artificial banana tastei just tried these somewhat by accident when i purchased something else on ebay and was scrolling through the other offerings  i thought why not and got the meiji chocolate bananas  i thought they would be hideous but am delighted to report they are wonderful  they have the crisp outer shell of an mm but its so much more pleasing due to its delicate banana shape  the chocolate and banana flavoring is in good proportion and overall it is just a great chocolate treati pulled this repice off the web and edited it slightly bottom line if you dont want to use yeast is to mix it outside of the bread machine first then use the quick bread setting to bake it i hate nuts in bread too lol  banana nut bread for machinesingredients cup butter melted cup milk eggs  cups allpurpose flour cup white sugar  teaspoons baking powder teaspoon baking soda teaspoon salt cup mashed bananas  large  small etc               directionsspray bread machine pan with vegetable oil sprayin a separate bowl premix ingredients in order listed place mixture in bread machine panselect the quick breadcake cycle press start check after  minute to see if mixture is well blendedbake until cycle stops remove the pan and cool completely  minutes before removing bread from pan
the texture is more like a cookie than a cake though its soft crunchy chewy fruity and chocolatey in just the right proportions  something that makes eating one of these little cm cubes far far too easy to do i put them in my mouth and they just seem to disappear theyre simply deliciouswith everything going on in those little squares its quite hard to make out distinct flavours occasionally youll get a lovely fruity hit from the cranberries and raisins but the overall taste and texture is more like that of a simple soft cookie perhaps the only slight disappointment  here is that it doesnt taste particularly chocolatey yumunfortunately i dont think they have an online shop yet but you could always ask oh well if you drop in tell them i sent you actually there is now a chocolate cellar online shop it went live yesterday and you can buy the tiffin on itthanks andy ive updated this post with a link
please welcome chocablogs new canadian correspondent michael edwards with his first official post from canadalandthe tin also had some mini victoria creams rogers most famous creation having these in a smaller version helps to offset their sweetness quite nicely even if they arent nearly as impressive as their bigger cousins all in all a decent box of oldfashioned style chocolates that doesnt offer anything out of the ordinary but thanks to a combination of the very pretty tins and the safe flavours this would appeal to the more conservative chocolate lover not that theres anything wrong with that
suggestion for angus next year make all your chocolate boxes play jingle bells when the lid is removedinside things are a more colourful with each of the  dark and milk chocolate pralines being decorated with coloured white chocolate there are  different flavours in total meaning some are duplicated im not going to review them individually but the flavours are cinnamon praline ultra smooth gianduja lemon praline cane sugar praline orange praline peanut praline cocoa crisp praline coffee praline chilli praline and macadamia and coconut pralinethats a lot of pralineand that in a nutshell pardon the pun is the problem with thesethe chocolate is of course delicious but ive never been a particular praline fan and while the quality of these chocs is great tastewise theyre ever so slightly boring theres very little variation between any of the chocolates theyre all the same thick slightly nutty paste with vague hints of other flavours theyre pleasant but nothing morei dont know about you but if im sharing chocolates with friends and family over the holidays i want them to be exciting fun and full of interesting flavours these just dont do it for me unfortunatelyso you bought a box of praline chocolates with the word praline written on the front in massive letters but you arnt a fan of praline so you did like them my my thats the greatest review in the world ever you are aware that the brand in question do s of different boxes of chocolates mostly mixtures of every kind of chocolate you can get and you specifically picked one that was just pralines made for the minority of people who only want pralines a minority which you are not a part of well done
i saw these thanksgiving turkey place settings at world market last year but didnt get any i regretted it afterwards so i had to pick them up when i saw them again this year since they seem to be a standard seasonal product id love it if they could become a standard to my thanksgiving as well you see i love turkeys its just one of those things im excited to bring turkey decorations out in november sad to put them awaybut im not convinced ill make it a point to get these again next year the four fat turkeys in the box are pretty and shiny in dark brown their smoothness is a little interrupted in some places but mostly theyre intact looks are their best feature though splendid chocolates based out of canada specializes in seasonalnovelty chocolates and unfortunately most such companies dont actually taste too special splendid is no exceptionthe dark chocolate used here is only average smooth but thick black very sweet twenty grams out of forty for one turkey are sugar its disappointing that items like this cant taste as special as they act the chocolate is sweet enough that i cant imagine wanting to eat it all at once especially at the end of a long thanksgiving dinner but pie is for thanksgiving dessert anyway these might make nice takehome chocolates and they would be a subtle yet eyecatching touch to the tablei wouldnt recommend going too far out of your way to find them but if youre looking for place settings at this late hour or have grandchildrenniecesnephews you want to give presents to they workcomments are closed
the chocolate is pauls  dark single bean chocolate and the sandalwood flavour comes from organic essential oil as the chocolate already has certain woody tastes to it i found the essential oil added a light aromatic top note which is evident when you smell this bar in among the dark cocoa scents sits a sweeter exotic aroma which hints at more complex flavoursrather than coming across as perfumey the addition of sandalwood makes for a gently fragrant almost lightly spicy aroma and flavour which sits well with the bittersweet cocoa certainly not what i had expected at all but there again a lot of what paul does confounds ones expectations as the chocolate melts and the flavours are released the sandalwood is always there but in a complimmentary way  it never marches all over the chocolate in short its another well balanced pairing of flavours done paul a young stylecomments are closed
but before i get to the chocolate i want to talk about the branding half of the front of the wrapper of this bar is taken up by the words eating this chocolate saves trees along with fair trade and organic certification logos  obviously this is a good thing but i was curious about the branding and the fact that organic meltdown seem to be relying almost entirely on the concept of saving trees to sell the chocolatei think its absolutely vital that if were going to support causes by buying heavily branded products like this we should at least know how they are using the extra few pence were spending brand stand  the company responsible for organic meltdown seem to be at least as concerned with the branding than the cause itself with a name like that perhaps i shouldnt be surprisedwith that rant out of the way lets get to the chocolate at  cocoa solids its definitely not one of the darkest ive had and there arent really any strong cocoa flavours but its not overpoweringly sweet either it might not appeal to hardcore dark chocolate aficionados but those with a slightly sweeter tooth will really enjoy itthe orange flavour is natural and refreshing theres a nice hint of citrus but again its nothing too overpoweringas you can see the candied orange is uncoloured and adds a very pleasant texture to the bar theres enough of it that you get a few small pieces in every square and it really is quite pleasantunfortunately i got a large hard fibrous piece of something that i hope was orange in one of the first chunks i tried it was completely inedible and i had to spit it out but im prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that was just a oneoffoverall i really quite enjoyed the bar and managed to scoff the whole thing myself id certainly recommend it to dark chocolate virgins but if youre buying this to save a tree youre going to have to do your own research to figure out where the money is actually goingi had a guy phone me trying to sell me shares in a company that was saving rainforests amongst other things needless to say i kept my moneythe branding on this product reminds me an awful lot of that attempt at scamming me i hope its not a scam but it sounds a bit dodgyi can assure you ashleigh that theres nothing dodgy about organic meltdown or the world land trust which is a very respected charity that has been running for  years to help preserve the worlds most biologically important and threatened landsas chocolate lovers youll no doubt be aware of the exploitative history of chocolate production this is a genuine attempt to give something backpleased you liked the chocolate dom there are three other flavours in the current range toolouise that faq page is written entirely in marketing speakcan you explain to me simply and clearly how my purchasing this bar led to a specific tree being savedi have been waiting for samples of organic meltdowns rebranded bars for a while now but i think postie must have eaten them while out on his roundsyes i can dom heres how it worksbrand stand and the world land trust identify woodlands that are in danger and estimate the number of trees that live thereeach bar of chocolate is assigned a number which relates to a tree in the endangered forestfor every bar of organic meltdown thats sold brand stand makes a donation to the world land trust to save a treethe trees are then owned by local conservation groups and managed by the world land trust an international charity established in  and based in the ukthus they are saved from destructionthe exact amount per bar to save a tree depends on where the tree is located the age of the tree and the size of the forest its in organic meltdown is currently working to preserve a forest of more than  trees in ecuadori appreciate that not everyone is interested in saving trees or preserving habitats but organic meltdowns aim is to give chocolate lovers the chance to help save trees if they wish ok thanks louise i dont know why the wrapperwebsite cant just say that in plain english too thoughthe chocolate bar sounds delicious whether or not its saving a tree
ive been to my supplier of polish chocolate does small dance for joyand they have a whole lot of new goodies there does even bigger danceof course i dont speak polish and would not know what most of the goodies are if they reached out and strangled me but i recognise chocolatey goodness at about  paces and thats good enoughthe rather large and imposing blok orzechowy kind of took my fancy it means block nuts or in plain english a nut block the photos dont adequately show the sheer imposing size this g brute is about  cm deep  cm high and  cm long i began to wonder what id bought so of course i had to rush home and with trembling fingers open the box after photographing it  as you doinside we find a plastic tub containing what looks an awful lot like a kind of biscuity loaf like my mum used to make tipping it out and cutting some off confirms thisthe presentation is well interesting the blok does not really come of the plastic tub very well and its kind of crumbly the nuts are fairly clearly visible but there dont seem to be the vast numbers of them that the photo on the box and the name would lead you to believethe loaf is also not very chocolatey i shoulda checked the ingredients  its there  at a mere  sigh still it should go nicely with a cup of teaive tried a wawel filled chocolate bar about two weeks ago it caught my eye because it looked nice and tempting on the outsidebut it didnt pass the most important test the filling which they dont even say what it is was dry and the chocolate unimpressiveim afraid i put too many links into the previous comment srebrna is rightaltough i remember chocolate block blok czekoladowy as a homemade product that indeed had no real chocolate but did have cocoa whatever quality was at the time avail in poland sugar margarinebutter dry milk nuts cookie crumbs etc i personally love it  it has nothing to do with chocolate but the taste and texture is unforgettable  i have never seen wawels product in michigan where i now live and suspect that it is not even close to the home made product in any case i would also recommend you checking out wedels dark chocolate i like it better than wawelsi agree completely
hertiage chocolate coins however are foil wrapped and made from belgian milk chocolate as far as im aware theyre not legal tender in gibraltarrather than coins the samples they sent me were medals including some christmassy designs and a huge g specimen with you are the greatest proudly embossed on the front and a ribbon to wear it around the neck after having worn it for half a day and wondering why it didnt say i am the greatest i decided i it was probably time to review itthere are no ingredients listed but details embossed on the back tell me its  belgian milk chocolate i love how this is all embossed on the actual chocolate as well  right down to the best before date they taste ok with a nice creamy texture and some pleasant cocoa notes but theyre really not that special ive had much much better milk chocolates but ive also had a lot worseyet theres something special about chocolate coins and medals that just makes me want want more of these not to eat but just to have i dont know if its just the fact that chocolate coins combine my two favourite things or if its memories of little bags of foil covered coins i used to see in sweet shops as a child perhaps its just the fact that i look so awesome wearing a huge chocolate medal around my neck all day  such a shame i forgot to take picturesomg loved reading your blogpost i added your rss to my reader
guest chocablogger michael edwards is back with more canadian goodieseverything about the victoria creams screams tradition from the classic red box to the individually wrapped chocolates nestled in the shredded paper inside it is easy to believe that nothing has changed about them in more than  years and thats one of those warm fuzzy feelings that some things are just fine the way they are the most obvious thing when opening the box is the size of these these chocolates are enormous with each one weighing in at an impressive  grams and measuring about  cm long these are not one bite chocolates if there was some kind of ultimate fighting championship for chocolates these would be more than able to take care of themselves  you get the idea theyre bigtheres a wonderful thick dark chocolate shell around every cream centre that adds some snap the bittersweet chocolate is apparently  which is a good thing because it really helps to offset the sweetness of the insides and the creams are just the way they should be  nice and smooth with plenty of flavour they are  different flavours available on a regular basis plus a few seasonal ones like cranberry and eggnog in this particular one pound box there was strawberry raspberry orange maraschino cherry peppermint vanilla coffee chocolate maple and caramel the absolute pick of the bunch is the peppermint which is a beautiful balance between the sharpness of the mint and the slowly emerging sweetness of the chocolate very yummy the fruit flavours are more subtle than expected probably because of the natural flavourings that dont overpower my least favourite was the maple which was just too much because of the maplely sweetness   one little bite and i was done i did keep returning though until it was gone persistence is always a good idea the biggest problem if you can call it that is that most people could probably only manage one or two of these in one sitting because while they are definitely not unbearably sweet they do provide a good oldfashioned sugar rush thats probably while they are still around after all this time they look sensational  i love the generous size
the reeses bar is different the peanutencrusted milk chocolate surrounding its own crumbly inside has that unique reeses peanut and salt smell theres more chocolate in this one as well as more flavors in general it also seems more buttery despite the others name while not giving a real fresh peanut butter taste it is a more real one what with all the peanut pieces it obviously then keeps up in the texture department im calling this one a snacking candyso i find that nestle and hershey have a very different approach for each of these theyre not very comparable the one unique common factor is the filing yet the reeses has a more delicate and smaller inside than the harder and more prominent butterfinger one im calling the reeses crispy crunchy surely they couldve come up with a better name the better of the two though that doesnt mean im giving up a lifelong acceptance however mild of butterfinger its just that that ones sugar and nothing morei grew up with butterfinger  it is indeed pure junk food as you say deanna this newcomer reeses bareven though it is probably superior in most every waycan never replace butterfinger in my heart or stomach  there is something to be said for nostalgia especially when it comes to chocolate  my acquaintance obviously goes beyond just acceptance   thats my candy and im stickin to itsvpindiquez moi chez quel detaillant je peux me procurer la butterfinger a l assomption pqi just had one of these for the first time it is very similar to a butterfinger and youre right it is higher quality id request one small change though i dont necessarily like the full peanuts inside of it it brings a boringregularoldpeanut element to it which makes it seem less like a dessert for that split second i suggest that they take the peanuts out and replace it with the creamy peanut butter they put in reeses cups the crispy crunchy is good but i much prefer the nutrageous barthough i have never tried the reeses crispy crunch bar i dont think i would like the peanuts as well i would much prefer a peanut butter  but i also am a diehard butterfinger fan from long ago as well as a clark bar fan that you cant find at many stores anymore these days  just my two senseje veux simplement savoir ou je peux acheter la butterfinger  montrallavalcest simple et pas compliqu si ce nest que par la poste ditesmoi le et jen commanderai soyez clair dans votre rponse merciwhat a yummy and hot chocolate
so what do we get in the tub sixteen chunky little rocky road bites formed from caramel cherries raisins marshmallows and biscuits wrapped in a  cocoa milk chocolate the chocolate coating is fairly generous but with all of that caramel and marshmalllow in there these were always going to be very sweet and sure enough they have a whopping sugar content  the structure of the rocky road bites is quite remarkable they obviously survive shipping and being carried home just fine but as soon as you bite into one its all over as they start to break up quite a feat to produce something thats so structurally sound up until you bite into ittheres definitely chocolate there and when you catch a taste of it it is quite rich smooth and verging on the darker side of milk but with all of the other sugary sticky fruity stuff thats been crammed into each piece these are not for people who wish to enjoy the flavours of good chocolate i found myself agreeing with doms assessment of the caramel chocolates  way too much sugar which just seems to obliterate a lot of potentially interesting flavour combinations however as a sweet office treat in the afternoon with a cup of tea at around pm to provide a sugar rush and defeat the midafternoon slump perhaps or something to nibble in front of the telly these probably fit the bill rather well im sure the majority of kids would really go for these as well so rather than getting naughty on the road these might well serve to pacify child passengers  at least until the sugar rush hits them and they have to be strapped in tightlytoo sweet for my tastes if im honest but the everexpanding range of g desserts does seem to have something for everyone and i shall certainly be looking more closely at more of their products in the near ftreou peuton acheter en france les gu naughtiestu peut acheter les produit lhttpwwwbritishcornershopcouk
according to george this bar is an absolute classic in greece arguably the most popular chocolate bar here and has been around since the s totally unchangedso is it any good or is it just something thats popular because its always been aroundas you can see its a fairly ordinary looking block it doesnt look particularly classy  even the typeface the chunks are embossed with looks a little cheap well so far i love this chocolate even better than hersheys  i dont say that out of pride since im greek because im also american however  greek chocolate and greek ice cream and authentic greek yogurt and greek honey is better   do the taste test for yourself  i cant find greek chocolate at my local supermarket here although he does carry a few greek things in there  papadopolis cigar looking chocolate wafers  greek honey like orino attikis  and some greek butter cookies like marianna cookies  i go further out and stock up on greek chocolate from titan a large greek supermarket in astoria  i see a great pastry chef in greece who uses only greek chocolate for his sweets and will not substitute any other chocolate for his sweets he was trained in france too  anyway  from all other chocolates its one of the best in greece and so is the cooking chocolate  dark and milk grevieracome on you cannot  review cadbury chocolate as tasty and ion as cheap and common it doesnt make sense
derry church artisan chocolates has an interesting history pastry chef and chocolatier eric cayton grew up around hershey pennsylvania where he grew to admire none other than milton s hersheys work he eventually started the derry church company to fulfill his chocolate passion eric has sent me nine of their bon bons which are all handmade without artificial flavors of preservatives the packaging is simple two black boxes held together by an offwhite band with the small town style logo the chocolates are nicelooking as well moving clockwise we haveoverall a nice set the  price tag is a bit high though in comparison to other offerings these dont pop out enough yet for  ill still recommend them as pleasant handmade chocolates but i would do so more wholeheartedly if that price went downenjoyed the review im a huge fan of derry church chef eric really makes fantastic product i too thought the price tag was a little high at first but honestly after trying some of his pieces i have no trouble paying a few extra bucks the quality of the ingredients to me makes derry church stand out the innovative design also makes for fantastic gifts i heartily recommend derry church to everyone simply fantastic thanks
but in the interests of science i bit into my name and was surprised at how good it  tasted both milk and white varieties are actually pretty good the white chocolate is  cocoa solids and while it doesnt have much flavour its not too sweet meaning you can chomp through it without feeling sick before you get to that strawberry flavoured pigthe milk chocolate is  cocoa solids and is smooth creamy and rather good i had been expecting something along the lines of cheap easter egg chocolate but this turned out to be very enjoyable the lolly and the car are made from the same chocolate and disappeared disturbingly fastobviously youre probably not going to buy this stuff for yourself but for a unique christmas gift they cocoapod certainly has my seal of approval
today brings another sampling of the staple food of the chocolate fiend the chocolate mint biscuitthis seems to be similar with its claims of gluten free dairy free egg free vegan non gmo im left wondering if it has any actual food in it the claims on the pack are pretty much the high pointfirstly the chocolate is compound raw cane sugar palm kernel oil soy flour cocoa powder whilst the chocolate coating is claimed as  of the product the percentage cocoa in that chocolate is not stated but its very soft and quite sticky you need to wash hands after eatingsecondly the remainder has the usual suspects for ingredients  to avoid the gluten there is chickpea tapioca and rice flour more palm oil etcthe biscuit part is actually not bad its nice and crunchy and youngest son compares it quite favourably to a tim tam which is therefore high praise the mint splat on top uses natural peppermint oil and is very minty  but the flavour in this case does not linger for hours afterthe disappointment though is the chocolate a dark chocolate coating is not soft this is soft and really there is no excuse for compounded chocolate  its possible to use real chocolate which is still free of the gluten eggs and whatnot perhaps worst of all though the chocolate tastes pretty ordinary the palm oil does have some kind of flavour coming through which is slightly unpleasant and this detracts from the experiencefor those with health troubles or allergies this might be a way to get a chocolatey treat for everyone else you can do better elsewhere the poor quality of the chocolate and the use of palm oil mean that i struggle to recommend this edible yes do again nocomments are closed
a well balanced smooth and creamy milk chocolate with a good whiff of cardamom which was evident as the packaging was removed the chocolate is very smooth full bodied and not too sweet with the cardamom adding its own unique top notes to the mix its quite  gentle subtle blend  dont expect rampaging cardamom flavours after all this is primarily chocolate and holly loves her chocolatelike its darker sibling theres a sense of good quality ingredients blended together with love and skill and the result is a very tasty bar of chocolate full flavoured and creamy milk chocolate with a very pleasing mouthfeel long on flavour with an underlying tang of cardamom which lingers on the palate as the chocolate melts away despite my best efforts to the contrary this bar didnt last as long as i would have liked
the halloween costumes are gone and the supermarket shelves have been filled with brightly coloured tat which can only mean one thing christmas is right around the cornerthis little bag was seen hiding in the edible brightly coloured tat aisle of my local tesco and being the season of goodwill i thought it only fair that i gave it a homeso what we have then is a already sweet cadbury milk chocolate coated in sugar then rolled in more sugar they must be awful rightwrongthese little things are seriously addictive they taste very similar to smarties but with much more chocolate in each one theyre incredibly addictive yes theyre sweet but theyre also completely unputdownabletheyre also rather cute to look at so i guess they would make fun christmas cake decorations or just put a few bags out into bowls for guests at your partythey really arent anything special at all but i just cant stop eating them luckily theres a generous g in each bag so ive still got some left er oh theyve gonecorrect me if im wrong but arent they just a christmas version of mini eggssnow bites for the winalso yep they are a christmas thing only reallly anoying if ya ask me loli guess you could think of them like that  but these are smaller than mini eggs and spherical and white and rolled in loose icing sugarid have loved to eat em but looks like lizard eggs lolha we dont tend to have that many lizards in my part of london so i hadnt considered that id say theyre more like cadbury shotsive never seen cadbury shots but i think you might be rightthese look yummy and perfect for the seasoncadbury shots tried both and theyre pretty much the same except these have icing sugar which makes them ten times more addictive
well this was a big surprise it turns out that canada being the forward thinking country that it is has taken it upon itself to pump up the cocoa solids in their kitkat and aero bars to a whopping  so these arent just the usual dark versions of the bars that have been showing up in other places around the globe these could potentially be the holy grail for dark chocolate lovers if they pass the taste testthe aero is actually a little disappointing the problem is that apart from the bubbles there isnt anything else added to the chocolate and so that means this is just some rather ordinary  chocolate with some texture and thats about it plus as is the trend with the darker incarnations of bars it is a little on the small side at just g the kitkat on the other hand is not disappointing at all quite the reverse the combination of the dark chocolate and the wafer works really well plus the wafer centre doesnt come across as being too sweet either which was my real fear so it isnt battling the bitterness of the covering instead it is a wonderfully harmonious experience that was over way too quickly my only advice would be to buy them individually because you can imagine what is going to happen if you keep several of them in the house nestl are very aware of the perceived healthiness of  chocolate and so have noted on the wrapper that both bars are an excellent source of magnesium and naturally occurring polyphenols although there is also something about balanced diet and exercise too so lets not kid ourselves im really not sure if canada is just ahead of the game when it comes to using  chocolate in popular consumer bars we also have  mms on our store shelves but given the love piled upon dark kitkats in the past im expecting to get a lot of people begging for me to share these maybe we can work something outthe  kitkat sounds good  where did you find itooh the kitkat looks delicioushmm sounds good id like to try some of those need to see if they have put in an appearance in australiai got them at a small magazine store and they dont seem to be particularly widley available ive contacted nestle canada to see if they are just testing the water or these are permanent additions to their range ill keep everyone postedkitkat  i want onenot true the aero bar is amazing best discovery in a while
as far as i can tell this is the same  milk chocolate with vegetable fat and filling primarily glucose syrup used in the bar and its really quite bad its very sweet and very sicklywhich is why it boggles me that this product even exists clearly its going for the after dinner mint market but if you present this garish pink box after a dinner party i can pretty much guarantee your friends will never speak to you againadmittedly the format of these thins gives a slightly better and less sticky experience than in the bar format but everything about them just screams i couldnt be bothered so my advice is not to be bothered and avoid these entirelynow if youll excuse me i have a box of pink yuckiness to dispose offso how do you dispose of things in cases like this dom throw them out pass them on to someone with less discerning tastes or eat them anyway and then feel ashamed afterwardserk as if anybody would be impressed if you whipped out a tesco branded chocolatehow did you dispose of them dom  frisbee them out of your window one by onein this case it just gets thrown out the stuff that isnt quite so bad sometimes gets given to unsuspecting family and friends well i am turkish and these do not have anything to do with turkish delight i can tell you that i honestly think that they taste terrible i bought five boxes of these yesterday i love them they are so nice and something addictive about them i disagree with this review everyone should try them these turkish thins taste great i just bought  boxes howdy i know this is kinda off topic but id figured id ask would you be ineetestrd in exchanging links or maybe guest writing a blog article or viceversa my site addresses a lot of the same topics as yours and i think we could greatly benefit from each other if you happen to be ineetestrd feel free to shoot me an email i look forward to hearing from you terrific blog by the way
this bar was made with madagascan chocolate beans that are said to have a citrus edge to them like the nutty bar dom reviewed the citrus bar did not taste very much at all like citrus to me it offered  a short burst of freshness to begin with which quickly faded into the bitterness i usually associate with dark chocolate my friend while noting more of the citrus tones lemony rather than orangey she said also noticed the quick fadeneither of us felt the sour cream finish mentioned in the blurb on the back of the packaging but the bar was rather creamy compared to many other dark chocolate bars i have sampled in the past though still not as creamy as milk chocolate obviouslyi found the concept behind this series of bars interesting as they seemed to me from the blurb to be educational in nature  teaching people who dont know much about chocolate how to be connoisseurs at least in their own eyes having tried this one i found the flavour description reminiscent of the blurb you often find on wine labels telling you about the wine being fruity flowery or spicy more often than not the flavours hinted at seem practically nonexistent as was the case here as i prefer strong flavours in my chocolate this wasnt really the bar for me at all but purists or aspiring purists may find it interestingcomments are closed
i cant remember where i purchased this interesting looking box of chocolates but it was either tesco or waitrose so theyre widely available in the uk  despite the fact that theyre made in belgium and the writing on the back of the box is in finnishi didnt pay close attention to the picture on the box when buying them which is probably a good thing because it wasnt until i got home i realised they looked like well you can see for yourself what they look likei assume they are designed to be covered in pretty flakes of chocolate but its highly unlikely they ever survive packaging and transportation looking like thatthese are allegedly dark chocolate truffles  with natural orange flavour although the first ingredients on the list are sugar and vegetable oil a combination of palm oil and coconut oil not the best of startsthankfully they taste ok they are very soft and creamy in texture but those flakes of chocolate instantly melt onto your fingers which is rather annoying the truffle filling has the consistency of whipped cream  although theres no cream in these i guess thats where the majority of that vegetable fat ended upthe orange flavour does taste quite natural but there is something not quite right with it i dont know if its the flavour itself or an interaction with the other flavours but it left a slight chemical aftertaste in my mouth that i didnt much care for it wasnt much but it was enough for me to notice  and to stop me wanting anotherso there you have it theyre very average soft orangey truffles if thats your thing and you dont care how your chocolate looks you might like them but i didntwhat a wonderful valentines preesnt you have there and i love the card for me nothing beats home made cards  my hubbie made me one too which he spray painted with a silhouette of a little boy handing flowers to a girl that was all i needed it made me feel very special indeed have a wonderful valentines day fran  lots of love to you  your loved ones xx
the beni wild harvest a  and  hour conch the cru virunga is  with bolivian cacao fascinated me the beans used grow on chocolate islands where theyre gathered by canoe and are so small in size that they require specially modified roasters its flavor notes are cognac raisins honeyed black tea its scent and initial hit reminded me of seeds thick dried fruits come in making it much like a fruit and nut bar without the fruit and nut amazing to remember that there are only cacao beans sugar and cacao butter in it a lovely deep liquid chocolate taste finishes it off strong yet fluid like gently pouring water like the other bar the texture is so smooth no grains no hardness  its like liquid glass a singular chocolatethe more chocolate i eat the more i realize that great as dark chocolate is i really love a good milk chocolate the esmeraldas milk is a   hour conch with ecuadorian beans that doesnt disappoint the highest expectations to begin with its a beautiful dark coffee color with a slight reddish tone flavor notes are buttered caramel hint of sea salt tobacco flowers expanding on the dark chocolates smoothness the milk is so soft such a buttery feel its like holding a flower in your mouth the caramel taste is delicate mixed with rich cocoa butter i was so wrapped up at first that i forgot it has fleur de sel in it as well its a small touch but enough to add a little twist and texture to the flavor a positively amazing chocolate it takes the best parts of a sweet milk chocolate and a flavorful dark chocolate chocolates who hit this line almost need their own category the single thing wrong with this bar is that its disappearing too fastit seems that original beans was having trouble with the lot number feature when i tried it the problem is fixed now and i was able to look at a different planting project for each bar loved seeing pictures of cacao trees at different stages of growth as well as getting the reminder that original beans works hard for both the earth and the people in it im convinced now that their chocolates are equal to their motives and you know  doesnt seem like too much for the esmeraldas milk and beni wild harvest even without the cause im finding them fitting to my style more than the cru virunga im considering calling the esmeraldas my favorite of the three im also glad to see that original beans has a voice and continuity going through their chocolates while still giving them differing flavors for the differing personthe single thing wrong with this bar is that its disappearing too fasthigh praise indeedwhoever designed this chocolate and business model is a genius we have served at the woodson place events and knocked peoples socks off
as you can see this sample was incredibly thin i was impressed with how thin theyd managed to get itthis is not to say that it lacks flavpur though the  cocoa dark chocolate spreads soft slightly bittersweet flavour over the tongue as light citrus from the orange element is released the chilli comes in towards the end and theres plenty of it not fiery hot but a spreading building heat which lingers at the finish its a little warmer than some but not worryingly hot i found the balance of flavours very pleasant indeedthe melange specialise in fruity spicy chocolate combinations and a glance at their website tells me that they also do wine and chocolate tasting evenings so theres a good chance i might find myself in peckham sometime soon based on this sample id also be quite keen to try more  particularly coriander and grapefruit and ginger and lime bars which sound rather delightfulthe melange is also a caf serving home made sorbets as well as tea and coffee and isabelle the chocolatiere also does chocolate making workshops sounds like a good place to hang outwould love to visit the shop and try some but that would mean a hour flight to londonwhich is ok with me
green  blacks have been pushing this bar quite hard lately oddly there seems to be a lot of large ads for it in london underground stations at the moment proclaiming that its a creamier and lighter than their standard milk chocolate bar which they claim some people find too dark im not sure i believe thatthe standard green  blacks milk chocolate bar is  cocoa solids while this is  gb make a big play about the dominican republic trinitario beans and real madagascan vanilla used in the bar they dont tell you where the sugar comes from though  and theres rather a lot of it in this blockdespite being sold as a creamier milk chocolate the taste is more akin to a rich white chocolate its very creamy and sweet and  as the wrapper says  it melts effortlessly in the mouth but it does have some nice cocoa flavours too theres a hint of nuttiness and lots of vanilla i picked one of these up in sainsburys the other day funnily enough very small bar for a whopping p which is pushing my limitsi found it was very basic for such a high price
according to this wrapper this is local n lekker collective cringe from english majors worldwide lekker is an afrikaans word that means nice good great cool or tasty pronounced thusly  lekkirr with a rolling r  local is the part i have a problem with clearly the name is french and the origin of the traditional crme caramel is actually spain crme caramel is a dessert which is basically a custard tart with a caramel top and sugar syrup poured over it a variation would be crme brule where the sugar forms a hard crust i understand that in other parts of the world it is also called flan but ive never heard the term used here what makes crme caramel so utterly delectable is its subtlety the actual custard part which constitutes the larger part of the desert is creamy and delicately flavoured the caramel top and sugar syrup adds a little more sweetness and a very pleasant almost burnt taste and vola  desserton a positive note at least theyve stayed true to the sickly orange representation on the wrapper  the filling tastes exactly how that looks seriously thoughit really is sickly sweet and i dont know what type of crack cocaine cadburys team was on but this is not even crme caramel flavoured the texture is grainy and puts one in mind of syrup thats been left in some dark corner of the pantry for too long except the taste doesnt even offer that burnt caramel flavour that syrup wouldi made myself a cup of chai to accompany this as the spiciness of the drink really compliments the creamy dessert but found that after two pieces i couldnt take any more cadbury has once again provided acceptable chocolate but the filling is far too overwhelming for one to even pick up on the milk chocolate for shame folkscrikey you dont pull any puncheswell flan is a spanish word and i tell you that a flan is completely diferent thing than crme brule flan is a very common dessert in spain and its solid it hasnt a creamy textureit is a good productits like a necessary thing  usin south africa we tend to like the sickly sweetness creme brulee may not have been invented here but most of us grew up with it in our homes so the name refers to it being a local favourite as opposed to a local invention as it were
im not sure that this is the same chocolate as was in the valentines assortment it may just be my memory but this one seems to have a firmer chewier caramel the caramel also has a very strong clean smell the more solid caramels usually are waxy while this one is wonderfully fresh the calm milk chocolate has a rounded out flavor to accompany it i cant even call it sweet  there are so many cheaply done caramelmilk chocolate combos out there they dont compare much to this onethe peanut butter squares have also gone halloween either one would be a nice choice if you want to celebrate a little with more than just the piles of candy at every cornerso they just changed the packaging and nothing else thats not very creative of themyour blog probably has to be the best blog i have ever discovered i love chocolateno not very creative at all but it seems like its either the topnotch companies or the ones on the other end of the scale that make holiday specific chocolates ghirardelli is in between the two i like them but they could use some more excitementcallum ghirardelli is pretty widely available in the us that is most grocery stores carry them and note that while theyre forty cents each theyre sold in  bagswhere i can buy it
cadbury have backed down and are reverting to the original recipe whether they change the block shape and packaging remains to be seen all the fuss though has been about the dairy milk range but horrors there was little said about the old gold dark rangemy local supermarket just happened to have stock of the old and new recipe  the old stock being sold at reduced prices to clear it from the shelves at the same time as changing the recipe packaging and so on they also changed the dark range around so that buying a likeforlike comparison was quite difficultanyhow i was eventually able to find what seems to be the closest possible before and after pairing  two samples of old gold dark chocolate original with intensity  now seeing as the formula was changed they cant both be original can theyobvious differencesso the change gives less cocoa  down to a mere  that barely rates as a dark chocolate at all the change is also supposed to improve the mouth feelin breaking a row off both i really cant tell any difference by the feel they are both nice solid blocks which break with a pleasing snap the mouth feel for both is much the same  in that they both melt away quite slowly to release their flavour the bite and the melt are much the samethe only difference is in the taste they are both fairly rich satisfying and quite sweet the only difference i can pick is that the new version has a slight but noticeable harshness its not entirely unpleasant but the version without the vegetable fat is smoother does not have the harshness and is more enjoyableinterestingly after i opened both oldest son devoured most of the after block before i could write this review he prefers it he can pick that the before block has more cocoa but he also agrees about the slight harshness in the taste of the afterbecause there was little comment from cadbury about what they are going to do about the old gold range i asked the fat is out it seems that the new old recipe is now in production again and will be finding its way through the warehouses and into our shops soon so no palm oil in our old gold either a good outcome thatcomments are closed
chocablog continues to have its finger on the pulse with a review of thorntons new metropolitan box launched todayin a similar vein to other chocolatiers keith hurdman has devised an orange blossom chocolate pairing the fruity flavour with  dark chocolate ganache wrapped in milk chocolate its quite sweet and delivers good authentic light tangy orange flavours which work well with the chocolate its another safe combination but one which many people will reach forwith milk chocolate from ecuador and dark chocolate from the dominican republic the chocolate itself wasnt in question what i wanted to know was whether or not thorntons were going to be challenging their customers with new and interesting flavours and it would seem that times are indeed changing thorntons are never going to bring out a box of chocolates crammed full of wacky adventurous and weird flavours  why would they want to alienate their customers  but theyve managed to push open the door of possibilities with this collection and whats more i think its got the potential to sell rather welljust stop anthropomorphising chocolate pleasemakes a change from the continental collection anywaysounds good i got put off after the dismal paris box but this seems to redeem them somewhatthanks for the reveiw simon might have to try it now dhopefully i can do that with mine  love your blog great info for meboth the packaging and the chocolates are beautiful  where are they soldpam thorntons shops in the uk and probably online at thorntonscouk but theyre not in the shops just yet
as you can see the bars are square similar to the thorntons blocks but at g these are a little smaller the packaging is simple but rather beautiful with spiragraph style patterns on the cardboard box which opens out to reveal the bar enclosed in gold paper very stylish rather than adding flavourings to their chocolate tcho use a colour wheel to describe the natural flavours the chocolate has in addition nutty bar there are also chocolatey citrus fruity floral and earthy all adjectives youll find used to describe any good quality dark chocolate tcho deliberately dont talk too much about origin or percentage although this is a  cocoa solids bar they see the flavour  the finished product  as being more importantdespite the name of this bar nuts arent the predominant flavour its quite intense and the main flavour i picked up on was like a black coffee as the chocolate melts it becomes sweeter and fruiter then fades back to a slightly more bitter earthier taste which is left with you after the chocolate has gone  something i wasnt particularly keen on myselfthe texture of the chocolate is very appealing its a thin bar and breaks with a satisfying snap but starts to melt the instant it hits your mouth you dont need much but its really quite moreishi also have the chocolatey variety in my stash so im going to save some of this to do a more direct comparison when i review that barcool videos and such a pretty bar of chocolate do you have any of the other ones im really interested to see if they actually do follow their adjectivesi tried one of tchos nutty bars a short while ago people questioned the ammount g and said it was too small but the sheer power of it is immense great reveiw dom hope to see more d
which translates as mountain of mushrooms so no prizes for guessing that inside the box were numerous chocolate and something biscuit cake mushroomsupon opening the box i discover that theres an inner foil bag to keep the contents fresh from the looks of the lid inner i might have some sort of code to enter on a website with the possibility of a prize somehow i doubt uk residents are eligible and i cant read kanji so lets get to the important partnow i know i have a reputation as a bit of a chocolate snob king of the ark side etc but these little mushrooms had me smiling as soon as i saw them theyre made up of a very plain biscuit think iced gems capped with a mushroom shaped piece of milk chocolate i have no idea about the cocoa content of the chocolate but its very middle of the road not posh at allas a snacknibbletv watching treat theyre perfect biscuit and chocolate  crunchy and sweet pop em in your mouth and munch away the obvious attraction here is the novelty shape we dont have anything like this in the uk so from outer packaging to contents theyre different unusualfrom  a serious chocolate tasting point of view theyre bog standard milk chocolate combined with biscuit nothing unusual there however presentation is half of the battle and they win points for novelty value but i wouldnt buy them as a gastronomic treati love when you review my favorites herei love these things so no magic in them thenif there had been the review would have read something like and then i woke up with a crowd around methats quite awesomewhere did you get them from simoni was fortunate enough to get a request in to a friend of a friend who was visiting england from japan i have numerous interesting japanese chocolates here nowjapan is cool this mushrooms are the only mushrooms i like
guest chocablogger michael edwards is back with another canadian offeringto be honest i wasnt even really expecting to find anything out of the ordinary in the chocolate aisle during a quick stop at the mall but there just happened to be a few unfamiliar wrappers lurking among the usual suspects and better still it was on sale unexpected sale chocolate is the best so i picked some up without paying too much attention because at  a bar i felt obligated to introduce myself to terra nostras intense darkas the name implies this has a nice high percentage   cacao and has a usda organic stamp right on the front despite that the first aroma isnt harsh at all nor particularly special  and doesnt do much to hint at the intense flavour that comes with the first bite this is a rather lovely bar that doesnt quite hit all the notes that the wrapper suggests theres plenty of currant but not too much leather but theres a wonderfully rich earthiness that sticks around for a long time afterwards  a very clean deep chocolateit turns out that terra nostra are a canadian company based in vancouver and their website lists some other possibly delicious bars such as pomegranate truffle goji berry with pink himalayanmineral salt and robust dark raisins  pecans in addition to their organic bars they also offer some rice milk bars for the vegan chocoholics out there but i think ill stick with the dark yummy stuff that goji berry with pink himalayan mineral salt sounds mighty interesting id love to try it if i could get some do you know if they sell it in australianot sure bernadette but i think it sounds rather good too hopefully ill be able to get my hands on some and will post a review when i doi havent tried this yummy yet but i have a friend that has  she has told me its more than a dark chocolate and is so pleasing to the pallet  she also said its too rich to eat all at one sittingam i the only one who doesnt know what conching ismk conching is the long slow grinding process that turns the cocoa mass into very fine particles depending on the chocolate  and the person making it  this can last anything from a few hours to a few days httpenwikipediaorgwikichocolateconchingthank you dom  and now i know 
faith in nature make natural beauty products of the sort you tend to see in health food stores they have a whole range of products made with real organic chocolate and no artificial anything i tried the soap the shampoo and the conditionerthe scent is quite subtle which i find is often the case with natural beauty products as synthetic perfumes are often strongersmelling it smells sort of like a cross between what you would think of as shampoo smell and a posh chocolate smell but both were not very strong coming out of the sachet i think the effect could possibly be stronger in a bigger bottle where the concentration is higherthe conditioner smelled much more like dark chocolate although was pale and creamy in colourthese products are apparently formulated especially for dark hair like mine and are meant to give the hair extra shine my hair certainly seemed to like the shampoo on first application and the scent although not immediately noticeable is certainly present in the undertones i must say that if youre hoping for the showering equivalent of bathing your hair in liquid chocolate youll probably be disappointed by the subtlety of the scent on the other hand if youre looking for good quality shampoo from a company that ticks all the natural eco and ethical boxes while enjoying the antioxidant benefits of chocolate then this is a fine choice  the conditioner too while making the hair smell and feel nice did not infuse it with a strong chocolate smell at allthe soap on the other hand in spite of a moment of doubt i experienced when sniffing it up close was far more chocolatey all the faith in nature soaps are created for a particular purpose which is stated on the label  cleansing relaxing etcthe smell didnt actually linger on my skin for very long but my skin does feel quite soft now so im happythanks for the link to faithinnature  this is a product range i hadnt heard of before i love the smell of palmers cocoa butter formula range too  really chocolatey  and available in most uk supermarkets and chemists such as boots and superdrug
we have that same crumbly filling of salty and sweet smell and flavor wrapped up in an average dark chocolate instead of an average milk chocolate the difference leans towards the subtle there is something lost though theres a little less of the sinfully enticing without the added greasiness of a milk chocolate versus a dark now the chocolate is just there i dont feel like it has as good of a relationship with the peanut butter that is theyre certainly not enemies but they dont come together with the same attitude im used to reeses cups being a junk food indulgence but the dark chocolate tries to bring it a step up without making a very big change the result is for the most part an unnecessary extra productthe change is still subtle because the peanut butter stays the main focus the minor focuss change doesnt get so much notice the reeses dark is kind of interesting to try out but ill be sticking to the original in the futureomg thats so yummy thats one of my favoritesi hope to see more chocolates in hereby the way chocolate lovers please view this also httpwwwilovechocolatetoocomyoull see more chocolates and recipes in herethankswhere did you find them  im in phoenix and we cant seem to find them anywherei love the dark chocolate reece cups has a much richer flavor one problem they are very hard to find  most stores do no carry them they do a good job of saturating tv time with the ads now please stock the shelves of as many stores as possiblei havent been able to find them either i was hoping that it would lessen the sweetness of the reeses they tend to put me into a sugar coma with that milk chocolate and the peanut butter inside i am in love with snickers dark but they too are impossible to find here my grandmotherinlaw sends scours reno nv every holiday to send me onei bought a pack today and after the first cup i now find myself hesitant to eat the other one i think its a strangenot a good type of strange combination of dark chocolate and peanut butter  i too will be sticking to the original and i am a huge fan of dark chocolate but this here is a no no
hollys organic milk chocolate weighs in at a hefty  cocoa so to my mind all that was required was to get the flavour balance right and wed have a winner however too much geranium and i was going to feel like id been drinking air freshener and too little and id merely be disappointedyou can see how dark this milk chocolate was  bursting with potentialit was always going to be the geranium flavour which arrived first waves of bright floral scents and a natural heady sweetness preceeded any cocoa flavours by a long way and it was only as the chocolate really began to break down that it was allowed to show off a little in fact i found myself wondering if chocoholly might produce a bar of this chocolate in an unadulterated form just so we could really appreciate the potential of a  organic milk chocolatebecause of its very nature the floral flavour arrives quickly and takes a long time to leave the chocolate flavours are always going to be slightly masked by the burst of geranium but upping the cocoa content was a smart move when tested on my usual group of all adult guinea pigs the only complaint was that couldnt have one each so a curious flavour which obviously has wide ranging appeal
like those i found these cute little tiny piglets in john lewis as youd expect from  well just about anything purchased in john lewis  they were obscenely expensive  at  for g of chocolate you dont exactly get a lot for your moneythe milk chocolate is  cocoa solids which is better than some but frankly not as good as i would have hoped for given the price thats reflected in the taste as well its sweet and creamy but not particularly chocolateyluckily you do get a single solitary pink pig in the pack this is white chocolate flavoured with strawberry and while not great its certainly the most interesting thing in the boxthis particular product is clearly trading of the fact that there is a certain section of the community that is mad about all things cute and piglety theyre not designed for people who love chocolate theyre designed for people who love pigsthe problem is i dont think i could even recommend them as a gift for piggy fans theyre just not worth the price  they are penny sweets being sold as a luxury gift so if you know someone who you think would love these do them a favour and protect them from themselves by buying them a large pack of bacon insteadwell i guess i dont need to go out looking for these  oyou know if you want pig shaped chocolate i would make your own i havent looked but i would put money on someone making pigshaped moulds that you could use thanks for the warning
these are however from the health food section of the supermarket  itself something a warning because the usual suspects are trotted out no this better that and more of something else blah blah blah in this case its gluten free  a quite legitimate claim for those who cant tolerate the gluten  and something of an achievement to get a gluten free biscuit other claims we have are egg free yeast free high fibre no added salt no preservatives no artificial flavours  i suppose i shouldnt sound off too much  there are other products which get far more bit carried away with their virtuesactually the part about this product that puts me off most is the name dlush sounds like a way to refer to ddrunken sot and trying to be kind of nice about it strange when i opened up the thing thats really noticeable here is the peppermint they say on the pack that its made with natural peppermint oil and they aint kiddin the chocolate is pretty soft and turns out to be compounded  made with sugar cocoa powder vegetable fat of some unspecified kind and milk solids it is  cocoa but still standards  please the biscuit within is very crunchy and pepperminty so how to you make a biscuit without wheat flour the ingredients are again revealing raw sugar it shows water rice flour vegetable oil soy flour maize flour cocoa powder soy fibre peppermint oilall things considered not bad could be improved using real chocolate instead of compounded not something id eat every day but its ok for a change  perhaps up to a point  hours after eating  of these i still have a very strong peppermint aftertaste in my mouth that just wont go away and im doing strong peppermint burps you can have too much of a good thingdlush  maybe its named for the new zealander accent
at this point i feel i ought to warn you  tasting this chocolate will corrupt you forever a small piece placed on the tongue unleashes the most amazing set of flavours theres very little initial sweetness and bags of lush fruity well rounded flavours from the trinitario beans it floods the mouth with a kind of essence of pure milk chocolate to me this was what all milk chocolate should taste like with the cocoa flavours completely dominant and only a hint of sweetness beneath the milky rich and frankly ridiculously moreish cocoa flavours i will have a very hard time eating any milk chocolate after this im afraidi dont know whether to thank hotel chocolat for sending me this or not ill never eat a piece of milk chocolate again without casting my mind back to the day i opened this box ive been corrupted foreverdroolmy favourite milk chocolate is valrhonas jivara closely followed by amedeis how does this comparekatherine de riera                                                                                                   i love your post and i love this egg such fun and so delicious had to tuck in and codulnt wait until easter sunday
in keeping with the look of the previous three offerings these chocolates come subtly decorated and once again there are two milk and two darkmy first choice was a milk chocolate disc containing glanga  a relative of ginger with a sweeter less fiery taste  and it was a gentle light beginning biting into this chocolate released light soft cocoa flavours which were quickly joined by vanilla notes from the cream centre as the creamy filling broke down the sweet flavour of galanga joined the chocolate it wasnt as strong as i had expected and i imagine the vanilla element was added to the centre to temper any potential heat or pepperiness from the root that said the sweet exotic taste of the galanga was definitely therethe ginger chocolate packed a little more punch than i had expected another soft light cream filling with a surprising orange colour surprising until you realise that the ginger has been partnered with mango for a flavour twist delivered subtle yet fiery ginger flavours which blended beautifully with the rich dark cocoa flavours of the melting shell its an old favourite but done with a tyical galler twist and done very wellthe other milk chocolate on offer contained ginseng now i happen to rather enjoy a cup of ginseng tea despite the fact that it does have an aroma reminiscent of boiling socks i enjoy the earthy root flavours and obviously the tonic effect and so i was quite keen to see how my first taste of ginseng and chocolate would goit seemed to me that there was slightly less filling in this chocolate but i would imagine that would be because ginseng packs quite a lot of flavour i can see how developing this chocolate might have been a balancing act  too much ginseng flavour could easily make this inedible to a lot of people but of course not enough and you inevitably run the risk of making a pointless flavour ie one that cannot betasted except by the most sensitive of palates of course the balance is spot on enough of the earthy deep ginseng flavour but tempered with gallers soft creamy milk chocolatethe final member of the quartet was a dark chocolate disc containing beetroot  another first for me and i would imagine for most people im a big fan of beetroot crisps and the prospect of beetroot combined with chocolate had me licking my lips in anticipation having tasted so many of jean gallers creations im pretty confident that whatever unusual pairings he offers will have been developed for reasons of taste rather than mere novelty value and the dark chocolate exterior soon gave way to allow the slightly sweet subtly earthy taste of the filling out to play if you gae me this chocolate in a blind tasting id probably not have guessed that it contained beetroot but i would definitely be guessing in the area of roots and vegetables it reflects the theme of the collection extremely well and is another example of fine chocolate makingas a collection these chocolates certainly fall into the unusual category theyre not cheap which makes me think that your average customer might think twice about embarking on this particular taste adventure however if you or someone you like has an adventurous palate then this could well be an ideal gift like their forerunners this collection is made with top quality ingredients and its a testament to the skills of m galler and his team but these are definitely not everyday chocolates well worth a go if youre entertaining and want something different to have with coffee or as a special treat for a chocolate lover thoughcomments are closed
the other ten chocolates were as i had expected of a similarly high standard to our two teasers i had previously tried there were some that stood out more than others but the whole selection was delightful  stephen and sun trigg are making some great chocolatesits been a while since i had a lemon chocolate and this one had a light delicate cream filling which contained minute fragments of lemon peel giving a lovely tartyetsweet combination of flavours reminiscent of a really good lemon meringue filling with a chocolate finish a definite winnerthe marc de champagne had a dark chocolate centre with light alcoholic overtones which build to a heady winey crescendo before melting away and allowing the dark chocolate shell to finish off proceedings if you enjoy alcohol and chocolate then you ought to try this onelike its predecessor the spearmint chocolate held its flavours in a dark truffle centre i really enjoyed this pairing  the spearmint feels fresh and natural and makes a great partner for the dark cocoa flavours of both filling and shell at no time did it feel as though i was eating anything chemical or concentrated great balance of flavours and a fresh minty finish a slight twist on an old classic done extremely wellthe passion fruit chocolate had a more solid feeling thicker filling with slowly developing passion fruit flavours which allowed the chocolate to melt before the fruit tastes take over however because the filling melts quickly the fruit flavours peak and fade before the chocolate shell is finished giving the dark cocoa flavours a chance to shine at the finishthis rose  lychee chocolate had me intrigued before i tasted itin my mind i could see how the lychee would work as a counter to the potentially overpowering rose flavours and i was not disappointed exquisitely light floral notes start things off before the more subtle flavours of the lychee come in to to temper the floral flavours its a magical combination of flavours and had me wishing for more as soon as id finished it the balance is perfectwhen we met stephen i was waxing lyrical about this one to dom which prompted stephen to tell me that this is their most expensive chocolate to produce apparently sun had rejected numerous rose oils before settling on one that costs something like  for ml he also told me that the lychee flavour requires a huge amount of fruit to create well worth all the trouble though  this is flagship materialthe mediterranean orange chocolate had a filling with a consistency somewhere between the passion fruit and the rose  lychee as soon as i bit into it i was hit with a burst of bittersweet fresh orange flavour this was so different from a lot of chocolateorange pairings  the fruit was fresh alive and full of sunshine it never became too sweet and never tasted artificial or cloying it left my mouth clean and refreshed and wanting moreafter the triumphant pairing of rose  lychee the raspberry and rose was always going to be a second best the centre is more jellylike and again it isnt too rosey i found myself wishing id tasted this before the rose  lychee because it is a very good chocolate its just that the rose  lychee was so fantastic that i found myself wishing id had another one to trya blackcurrant and redcurrant chocolate was another well balanced combination the blackcurrant never took over and the redcurrant tempered the sharpness verey well i was surprised to find seeds and peel in the filling most of the previous chocolates had smooth fillings  but obviously fresh fruit was used a good berry combination  fresh clean and with a touch of blackcurrant zinglaudens fine chocolates are just that  fine chocolates this is of course reflected in the price at  or so for a dozen theyre definitely special treats but the quality of the ingredients shines through in all of their creations  as a small chocolate maker stephen and sun trigg can still maintain their high standards as they are involved at every step as stephen said to me the next phase will be interesting for them  upscaling production while maintaining their high standards i wish them every success and recommend you try some of these rather lovely chocolatesthese are almost too beautiful to eatim glad you said almost pam because there certainly are good enough to eatthese are without doubt some of the most beautiful chocolates i have ever tasted the raspberry  rose was exquisite the salted caramel amazing beautiful  and im not a chocoholic  jrmbought  for mothers day from haley and cliffords on street lane leeds im afraid i couldnt resist  delved in fantastic now i will have to buy another selection for myself sorry for my motherexquisite chocolates given to me by my cousin andrea webbdid i see them at the food show in  at snape maltings in suffolk please could you find an outlet in tunbridge wells kent hazeli ordered two boxes for christmas one for me and one for a gift  order placed online in october but no chocolates have arrived yet  they have been paid for shown on my bank statement  i have tried to phone lauden but their phone just cuts me off while the website refuses to accept my log in i am very disappointed with their customer services and am concerned that i have been conned
the pepper adds an interesting dimension but its quite subtle and adds more flavour than it does heat  unless you happen to bite into one of the larger pieces of ground pepper that are left after the chocolate and strawberry have melted awayalternatively for those with very sweet tooths gorvett  stone also do a white chocolate valrhona again with freezedried raspberries i had planned on reviewing that too but made the mistake of taking it to a barbecue where it not only disappeared within seconds but was unanimously declared the best of the  considerable chocolate stash i took along
with names like magma and eruption and ingredients as firey as espelette and sichuan peppers i had  fairly good idea of what to expect but i am also becoming acquainted with jean gallers style of chocolate making so i knew there were surprises in storethe second milk chocolate disc was fusion and as soon as i popped it in my mouth i knew i was in for something peppery the melting sweet centre carried undertones of fruit and spice with strawberry and pepper playing on the palate still fairly mild and gentle the contrast of strawberry and spice was carried off very well the fruit tasted natural i have an abiding hatred of nything that is artificially strawberry flavoured and in partnership with gallers milk chocolate it made for a lovely mouthfulthings became a little more serious when it came to the eruption chocolate dark chocolate bitterness soon gave way to a smooth light creamy filling which cunningly waited until it had almost disappeared before delivering a wave of spicy warmth never harsh or unbearable this subtle blending of sweet and spice left my mouth warmed but never scorchedmy final taste sensation turned out to be another first for me  smoky chocolate no less by using an infusion of lapsang souchong tea galler have created the first smoked filling i have ever tasted and i have to say i absolutely adored it my first reaction was shock  fire damaged chocolate something wrong with my tastebuds no the final taste experience from les volcaniques is your actual smoke and chocolate combination another of jean gallers surprises and a masterstroke of flavour mixing i was laughing again as the smoky filling covered my tongue mentally paying respect to m gallers imagination and skillcomments are closed
to make the basic recipe you need to use all of the cocoa butter around half of the cocoa powder and a little agave syrup so the remaining cocoa an syrup can be kept for making cocktails or other chocolatey drinksmaking the chocolate is very simple  break up the cocoa butter a little put it into a bowl over a pan of hot water add the cocoa powder and agave syrup and melt the lot togetherit doesnt take too long before everything starts to melt together and you have your basic raw chocolate mixed and ready after that its just a question of what you do with it we decided to make a small bar using some dried chopped fruits  lemomn raisins black cherries and blueberries in this case for simplicity a small margarine tub was lined with cling film and then the fruits were scattered over the base before the chocolate was poured in a spell in the fridge to set it and we had our first bar easy as thatindividual chocolates were made using an ice cube tray  some were left natural but i also experimented with baileys and patron xo caf a coffee liqueur made with tequila which also tastes great on ice cream or as a basis for a tiramisu adding alcohol made the chocolate coagulate very quickly but didnt affect the texture once it had seti also experimented with cardamom seeds a personal favourite and had good results the chocolate itself is as you would expect raw chocolate to be it has that slightly coarse texture melts very quickly and is smooth and soft on the palate adding other flavours works well  the fruits in our minibar were a great counterpart to the cocoa flavours and the alcoholic chocs were deliciouschoc chick market these kits as a fun way to spend an afternoon with children or a way for foodie types to explore chocolate making at home im a little dubious about how much fun a group of children would have with this  after all standing over a bowl which is resting on a pan of simmering water isnt for young kids and there is only really space for one stirrer at a time the fact that the bowl also gets hot means a good deal of adult supervision is required and i could see the potential for arguments around who gets to stir and blend the ingredients never mind who gets to lick the bowl spoon etconce the chocolate is ready the business of pouring it into moulds requires a steady hand and at p per chocolate youre not going to want to waste this stuff i cant help thinking that  plus postage is a little on the pricey side but obviously these are expensive ingredients  just look at the price of packaged raw chocolate bars choc chick also have impeccable social and environmental credentials so customers should be aware that their money is going into a business based on sound principals and again that comes at a premiumif you quite like the idea of raw chocolate and fancy trying your hand with a few flavours id say give this a go if youve never tried raw chocolate before id suggest popping into a health food store and buying a bar first just to be surecomments are closed
like the paris box we have a total of  chocolates here with  unique varieties but despite suffering from a little bit of blooming these look a bit more appetising than their milk chocolate siblings looking at the menu there seems to be much more variety in the flavours tooso lets see what weve gotok so as you can probably guess im not impressed with these at all some of the ideas were interesting but the execution was poor and the ingredients cheap and nasty not to mention the large indentations on the back of each chocolate that look like someone has stuck their thumb into themthis is really disappointing  i was prepared to give the paris collection the benefit of the doubt but these are simply nasty luckily i know theres some high quality stuff coming from thorntons soon so if you see this in a shop avoid itand thorntons  please stop wasting your time and money on junk like this and concentrate on quality pleasehave you tried the non bloomed versionsi havent no they offered to send a new box but nothing showed up not going to buy one because there are much more exciting things in thorntons to spend my money on there certainly is more exciting things to buy for us non traditionalists
still theyre sweets rather than luxury cocoarich chocolates and for what they are they are simply gorgeousthe subtle but noticeable aroma of the real valencia orange oil is evident as soon as you open the bag and that real orangeyness comes through in the flavour too for a few seconds you get that natural orange hit followed swiftly by the sweet creaminess of the white chocolate and then by the unmistakable crunchy creaminess of shortbread biscuit and all too soon its gone and you have to stuff another ten of them into your mouth in a completely dignified manner of coursewhat else is there to say about these theyre simply yummy way too good to give away to trickortreaters thoughcomments are closed
so aside from the rose and chili bar we have a milk chocolate with lemon and chilli a white chocolate with orange and chilli and this rather spectacular looking dark chocolate with cranberries and lots and lots and lots of chillinow if you ask me that amount of chilli flakes and seeds is just showing off this isnt one of those slowly mouthwarming chocolates that leaves you with a nice tingle it starts off hot the instant you put it in your mouth then just gets hotter and hotter the cranberries are tasty and flavourful but they cant really compete with the heat of the chilliit isnt the kind of bar that you want to be alone with its like that slightly crazy exgirlfriend that seems exciting and fun on the surface but you know has a secret plan to do you physical harm an interesting topic of conversation amongst friends but definitely not long term relationship materialthe other bars are a little more sane but they still fall into the hotter end of the chilli chocolate spectrumthe milk chocolate with lemon and chilli works surprisingly well the lemon adds a subtle tang that cuts through the sweetness of the milk chocolate without obliterating the cocoa flavours personally id have liked to try this one with less chilli the heat still builds quickly and hangs around in your mouth long after the other flavours have gonethe white chocolate with orange was probably my least favourite of this selection the creamy sweetness of the white chocolate just didnt sit right with the orange flavour for me and again the chilli was a little too strong for my likingloving the crazy exgirlfriend analogy that must be a first in chocolate reviewingthat looks like one scary bar of chocolate i dont really understand why theyd throw in some cranberries when theyd be at odds with the other flavour  too much sweet still it looks pretty cool
it only took a small bite out of our mans jawbone to remind me what i love so much about this chocolate its smooth and creamy with rich chocolate flavours but never too sweet its the kind of chocolate you can either let melt slowly in your mouth or just scoff it down all day luckily the packaging doesnt list the calorie content but im sure it must be ok i mean why else would they send me nearly half a kilo of chocolate unless they meant me to eat it all myselfif youre more of the sharing type than me then this would make a great addition to a halloween party its probably not the kind of thing you should stuff into the hands of passing trickortreaters but its perfect for sharing out amongst a small group of friendstheres very little else that can be said about this its large chocolatey yummy and boney just like it says on the boxcomments are closed
in the square corner we have their milk truffles with sea salt and in the round corner the dark chocolate house trufflesi want to start with the house truffles because these are quite unusual  purely because they are incredibly dark unless you give them time to melt slowly in your mouth theres hardly any sweetness to them at all just lots of rich dark cocoa notesfor me they were a little too dark and i had to work a bit too hard to pick up on the sweetness i really wanted true converts to the dark side will no doubt go nuts for them but im not entirely convinced the average person stumbling across a chocolate shop in henleyonthames would feel the samethe milk truffles however are something entirely differenttheyre dusted in the same dark cocoa powder as the house truffles but that quickly gives way to something much sweeter and more exciting delicious chocolate and a smooth soft toffeecaramel like filling thats simply divinethe closest i can get to describe the flavour is gourmet rolos so if you were the kind of child who scoffed a whole packet of rolos without sharing the last one i guarantee adultyou will do exactly the same thing with these those truffles sound gorgeous im a huge fan of chocolate and salt combinationsi do envy the chocablog team i want some delicious freebies to review too ptheres always a price to be paid laura salted caramels do appear to be the flavour of the moment though
the chocolate is superb  soft quick to melt with a great mouthfeel and rich dark cocoa notes which sit over a gentle underlying citrus note encounter a fragment of pepper and the whole taste experiences switches gear as the spice imparts warmth and spicy high notes the very nature of the bar means that the peppery element is intermittent and tends to come as the chocolate breaks down in the mouth as your teeth find the pepper fragments they release their fire into the mix imparting peaks of intense spice to the dark cocoa and orange basethis is quite complex chocolate a well balanced cocoacitrus alliance which floods the mouth with rococos own version of that tried and tested partnership and with added fire i loved the cocoa flavours was nodding in appreciation of the blending of the orange oil and smiling as little pepper bombs went off in my mouth excellent stuff and highly recommended for the more adventurous among youcomments are closed
rather than start with something i knew id probably like i decided to try this milk chocolate and butterscotch combination ive never really enjoyed butterscotch childhood memories of small blocks of the stuff in golden wrappers the slightly sickening rich buttery taste  i never finished a butterscotch in my life so at this point you might be forgiven or thinking that i was on the warpath however the truth is somewhat different luckily for me the butterscotch comes in the form of tiny pieces suspended in the bar thereby avoiding any butterscotch overload and allowing the flavour to be spread through the chocolate rather than dominating the whole taste experiencethe chocolate itself contains only  cocoa solids but still manages to deliver pretty good cocoa flavours the addition of dried cream makes for a richermilkier flavour and the butterscotch adds an extra little sweet kick especially at the finish when the chocolate has all gone and youre left with the fragments to roll around your mouththe inside of every divine wrapper gives the customer detailed information about how divine came to be with investment from from the body shop and twin trading and investment from christian aid and comic relief the farmers are also shareholders in the business and consequently benefit greatly from all sales of divine productsdivine are obviously aiming to produce good quality fairly traded chocolate with mass appeal and i think theyre doing it very well this isnt highfalutin handmade posh chocolate its something to buy whenever you feel like a bit of decent chocolate to nibble on and in terms of taste and ethics its a good choice to makeglad to hear that the cooling off period helped between you  divinei was hoping maybe it was an actual butterscotch white chocolate bar some sort of caramelized sugarmilk with cocoa butter sounds pretty good though sweet of coursethe packaging is beautiful and it sounds delicious as well  will have to try this one
this one is a  madagascan milk chocolate with hazelnut  raisin in a funky looking purple box its your basic fruit  nut and as you can see it comes in the now familiar thorntons squareblockwithoddshapedchunks formatnow im not the worlds greatest fruit  nut fan  its not something i actively seek out when looking for exciting new chocolates to try  but i managed to polish this one off in no time flatcomments are closed

chococo are based in dorset and produce all their chocolates by hand in small batches using local organic and ethically produced ingredients where possible as you can see they also have some incredibly pretty packaging with lots of bright coloursthe chocolates inside the box are equally pretty and looking at their web site they seem to do a vast array wonderful looking creations ive got just nine of them here to look atall in all these are some of the nicest chocolates ive had in ages fantastic flavour combinations and quality ingredients put together by some genuinely lovely people i simply cant recommend them highly enoughthey look as divine as you describe them and i havent had breakfast yet
now whether the picture and information is there to tell us that this cocoa was made from the  harvest or whether its just there for decoration i couldnt say but the inside of the wrapper features a couple of models in a cheesy pose that im guessing is designed to hint at the sensual pleasures chocolate can bring to me it just looks like another art director has made some more money decorating a product with an expensive and irrelevant photo ambiguous packaging design aside i wanted to know how the light crisp flavours id encountered in the  stick from the aoc awards translated into proper chocolatecheesy photos aside this  cocoa milk chocolate bar carries many of the flavours in the  cocoa stick we received at the aoc awards this chocolate has a great mouthfeel and packs great cocoa taste without being in the slightest bit cloying its milky creamy light and far too easy to eat well rounded cocoa without a trace of sharpness underpinned by the creamy dairy tastes that define good milk chocolate its as good as any milk chocolate ive ever eaten and i wish there were more companies producing bars to this standardshame about the inner photo thoughcomments are closed
paris is part of thorntons new city box collection of chocolates supposedly inspired by particular city they also do a milan box of dark chocolates which ill be looking at later this week paris it turns out is all milkinside the attrictive box there are two layers of  chocolates with a total of eight different ones to choose fromthe general theme of this box seems to be soft centres with subtle too subtle flavours and assorted cripsy bits there isnt a great deal of variation within that theme and you might be hard pressed to tell some of them aparta couple of years ago i might have ranted about how dull this collection is but its clearly not aimed at me and now that i have a better idea of thorntons strategy im ok with it its a nicely presented box and is the kind of thing that the traditional thorntons shopper will be attracted to  and while theyre there hopefully theyll discover some of the new and exciting products on offeras it stands this would make a perfectly good gift i would be more than willing to get my dad a box if it werent for the fact that he seems to have inexplicably developed a taste for valrhona latelythe last three sound like something i would really like
les florales was jean gallers initial foray into this particular style of chocolate and as the name suggests these discs are filled with one of four quite different flower flavoursas you can see from the information offered up on the inside of the box lid these chocolates came about when danil st presented jean galler with the four different flowers   clockwise from top left  violet orange blossom jasmine and rose interesting mingling of english and french in the title by the wayso what of these fragrant little beauties well for starters the chocolate used in the shells is excellent creamy buttery milk chocolate rich slightly tangy dark chocolate and a creamy white chocolate to accompany what is already the sweetest of the quartet the rose the filling doesnt hold back on rose flavours for a moment flooding the mouth with its distinctive taste as the chocolate melts and mingles a sweet treat for surethe only milk chocolate on offer here is the jasmine and i found myself liking this much more than the rose the floral part of the pairing is beautifully balanced with the buttery milk chocolate its not so subtle as to be understated but neither does it ever become too much for the taste buds as the chocolate melts away the mouth is left with a lingering floral freshness which is very pleasant indeedthe use of dark chocolate serves as an excellent counterpoint to what is undoubtedly a quite sweet and powerful flavour its a balance which is held to the last melting moment of the dark chocolate and like the jasmine chocolate this one left my tongue awash with summer flavours once again i can appreciate the flavour of violet without feeling as though ive licked a sachet of pot pourri found in an old ladys sock drawerthe final member of the florales quartet is a dark chocolate disc flavoured with orange flower  something of an old favourite in the world of chocolate but of course this is a floral orange rather than a fruity flavour as soon as i popped the disc into my mouth the flavour began to spread and as the chocolate shell melted and released the creamy filling the flavour of oranges reached its peak never cloying or artificial in character as the orange reached its height the dark chocolate released its flavours the bitter sweetness of the cocoa tempering the sweetness and making the finish more cocoa than orange with the final lingering tastes being a combination of dark rich cocoa and light fragrant orangethese are definitely sweeter in nature than the les marines naturally  sea salt and seaweed are never going to be that sweet and the use of flower essences puts one in mind of a summers afternoon these are apparently very popular with female consumers and i can see why if you enjoy the occasional chocolate orange have a penchant for light slightly sweet and fruity flavours with your chocolate or just fancy enjoying something fragrant and floral then you could do a lot worse than to check out these well thought out and carefully constructed little discs of delightcomments are closed
so what to do with it a nibble at it gave me some idea of its character  light fragrant cocoa flavours slightly bitter but not tongueshrivellingly harsh and obviously lacking in sweetness it set my mind to thinking about desserts and this is what i came up withthe cream was whipped until firm and then half was put aside the remaining half was blended with a generous dollop of the chocolate spreadtaking care to incorporate the cream gradually i ended up with a smooth creamy mixturenext the banana was sliced thinly and laid over the biscuit baseafter that i spread a layer of my cream and chocolate mix over the bananas and then made a layer of halved raspberriesall that remained was for me to take the rest of the whipped cream and top off the ramekins now at this point the desserts could be said to be finished but i discovered a curious thing grating a generous amount of the hotel chocolat stick over the cream transformed the taste the light cocoa flavours blend amazingly well with the cream much as they will with hot milk i imagine lifting the overall taste to new heights i was surprised that such a seemingly minor addition could do so much but it didand the desserts universally praised and consumed with gusto they took about twenty minutes to make cost a lot less than ready made puds and the fruit cu the cream and chocolate perfectly a neat alternative to just grating this lovely cocoa into hot milknice one simon  theyre kind of a naughtier fruiter version of tiramisu mated with trifle trimusuthis is something fantastic i like the idea of chocolate party for children  birthday
for a start the standard dark chocolate bar has just two ingredients fair trade single origin cocoa and organic cane sugar sound good right well just wait until you see the baryou probably need to click through to see the full sized photo to get a better idea of what this bar looks like but the appearance is almost that of snakeskin because rather than undergoing lengthy industrial processes the cocoa and sugar are simply forced together in a cold pressbut whats more amazing than the look is the texture what you end up with is a dry crumbly crispy almost biscuitlike texture thats quite unlike anything ive ever tastedthe flavour is the really surprising thing though for a product that contains only cocoa and sugar its neither too sweet nor too bitter the sugar simply takes the bitter edge of the cocoa and allows you to experience the rich deep cocoa flavours in a way that shouldnt scare anyone offhere we see the pistachio flavour bar thats made exactly the same way but has bronte pistachios added to the mix before pressing once again incredibly simple but effectiveat  per bar these are not cheap at all in fact even for a quality product like this im concerned that they may be pricing themselves out of the market  or at least preventing the average person from trying it in the first placebut i  do think all chocolate lovers should seek it out and try some it manages to combine the most basic and natural chocolate ingredients in a way that shouldnt scare away even those with the sweetest of tooths just dont approach expecting a smooth glossy bar of mass produced chocolate and i think youll love itthis chocolate is very different  but wonderful  my favorite is the pistachio which is lovely  the best thing about it is that is does not leave a lingering taste in your mouth i know it is expensive but you do not need a lot of it  a little is very satisfyingi would love to get my hands on one of these  is rather steep though i dont think i could justify spending so much money on one chocolate barchocolatelover  if youre going to post comments saying how wonderful something is it would be helpful if you disclose the fact that you are working for deangelisthese look really interesting but the price is a little on the scary side especially if you end up getting hooked on them was the pistachio one the only one you triedi only tried the plain and pistachio ones i cant speak for the other varieties but i didnt think the pistachio added a great deal to the experience myselfthis chocolate is fantastic id recommend it to everyone but id also recommend going to their shop directly if you can  in harpenden just outside london you can buy the bars from  each a price much more up my street and at the moment they have a bogof offerand no i dont work for deangelis im just a happy harpenden residentjust thought id let you know what i thought of the chocolate it does not taste good  way too sweet for my liking  more sugar than cocoa i do not like to crunch on sugar when i eat chocolate from the reviews it seemed like you could hold it in your mouth and it melted together but thats not how it is at all  the cocoa melst and youre left with a mouth full of sugar  eurgh the ones with nuts were disappointing as there were way too few nuts in them and the coffee one was just bitter i am not sure what kind of chocolate those reveiwing this have tried in the past but i am used to artisan chocolate and this came no where near to the level of quality i was expecting the box was nice and the hand wrapping of the chocolate but ultimately i feel this was simply to convince people that what they were getting was something more than it was  cocoa and sugar pressed togetherreaddont laugh at this just do itstart thinking sohimteng you really really want cause this isastounding the person that sent this to me said their wish came true mins after they read the mail so i thought what the heckyou have just been visited by drsuesss cat in the hat he will grantyouone wishmake your wish when the count down is overmake a wishsend this to  videos within the hour you read thisif you do your wish will come true
the back of the box has some tasting notes from gerard coleman mr a du cit is believed that mole was created by the nuns of the order of santa clara in the th century mexico mole poblano is now a popular sauce prepared with dried chiles mulato ancho pasilla and chipotle ground nuts ground tortilla cocoa beans and a long list of spices such as aniseed coriander allspice clove and rosemary all ground into a thick rich and chocolate color paste it traditionally accompanies poultry this bar made by conching and refining south american cocoa beans with mole plays on the tastebuds it has depth body and a mild pungency culminating in a pleasant heat it is the balance of the multitude of ingredients in mole that gives richness and sophistication to this barmultitude indeed  there are at least eleven ingredients in the mole part of this bar including ground tortilla thyme numerous chillis and hoja santa otherwise known as the mexican pepperleaf with so many ingredients and yet a promise of subtle flavours i was intriguedthe underlying spiciness is evident as soon as you sniff the chocolate it has a warm almost cakelike aroma sitting in there with the smell of the cocoa if youve ever had lebkchen german gingerbread biscuits often sold around xmas then if i say that some of the underlying spice notes are very similar youd probably understandthe surprise was that as i began tasting i wasnt assailed by a multitude of spicy flavours and certainly no gingerbreadcake there is a gentle warmth thats for sure but the blend of spices never becomes overpowering and certainly not enough to cause anxiety the heat does build gently but its never a fight between chocolate and spice one can always pick out the woody deep cocoa tones from within the overall taste unusually for me i demolished most of the bar during the tasting process okay so its only a baby at g but still its unusual for me to eat so much in a sitting i found myself enjoying the warmth and loving the mouthfeel and cocoa flavourswhen i visited the artisan website i couldnt help but notice that theyve opened a cocktail bar in west london i can feel a chocablog christmas party coming oni love artisans fusion bars mole is good but my personal favourites are lumi and black cardamom and the new shop is brilliant if you havent tried their salted caramel ice cream head there and enjoy i discovered artisan du chocolat in selfridges for the first time this weekend was absolutely blown away the fusion bars are stunning the mole especially but the origin bars are also incredible and oh my god the darjeeling bar staff were also fabulous and let us sample all sorts including the liquid salted caramels and i do finally see what all the fuss is about am i gushing i actually stood at the till with my  or so bars feeling quite light headed and began to see why my fiance thinks i have a problem with chocolatei made a trip to selfridges in manchester today and was thrilled to see the artisan du chocolate stand unfortunately being so far from london i have had to make a  hour journey to satisfy my deepest darkest cravings before i am totally in love with their liquid salted caramels i also got a good selection of their couture chocolates and oh my the coriander praline was amazing i know what my boyfriend can buy me for christmasjust waiting for paul a youngs to venture north now
stage one was easy  make an incision along the length of the fruit being careful not to split the bananasnext pack as much of the rather delicious chocolate spread into the cavity as is reasonable ie dont smear it all over your banana otherwise the finished product will be difficult to manage when serving once satisfied with the levels of chocolate the bananas should be individually wrapped in foil and put into the oven for about fifteen to twenty minutesonce cooked all that remains is to carefully open the foil parcels and reveal your cooked bananas  a degree of dexterity is required to get them out of the skins intact and without burning your fingers but if your fruits were reasonably firm to begin with it shouldnt be too difficulti decided to serve mine with ice cream as you can seeas you can see i almost forgot to take the finished product photo and this bowl had to be whisked away from a rather annoyed dinner guest for a quick snapshotsince i have a reasonable quantity of this spread my intention is to try a couple of other recipes so keep your eyes eeled for at least one other culinary experiment using gallers chocolate spreadoh my gosh that looks divine youve made me crave warm chocolaty bananas at am damn youreminds me of cooking choco bananas on the campfire when i was in the girl guides p
this puts me in mind of the chocolate frogs from the harry potter books 
the two with orange stripes are gingerbread truffles or a luscious combination of gingerbread and milk chocolate there seems to be a dark chocolate layer as well resulting in a thick shell it certainly smells good with all the spices of the holidays if more christmas than harvest the moist and silky inside reminded me that i havent had a truffle in ages this was a nice choice to break my fast the fresh spice of the gingerbread flavor mingles wonderfully with the milk chocolatedusted in the classic cocoa powder are two tiramisu truffles im finding the cocoa pathetic its too made up instead of naturally messy they taste nice though the shell is thinner this time so theres more of that silky filling mild and sweet coffee and chocolate remind me of the laposse hard candies from mexico maybe thats no coincidence since tiramisu is italian and the laposse founder i now find was born in italy there are not two but three salted caramel truffles described as creamy caramel layered over a salted ganache enrobed in dark chocolate forgive me as i try to figure out which layer is which what i see is a filling inside two dark shells continuing on to taste we have chocolate and salt and caramel all brought together in the filling in a wellplaced balance the dark chocolate is sweet which most people will like but i do wish the shell were thinner id rather taste more of that smooth and slightly tangy ganache then it might be worth it to have three of these instead of three gingerbreads or tiramisusim tempted to call  for nine truffles  grams a tad pricey but ive reconsidered individual chocolates always cost more and so do holidayseasonal offerings amongst less worthy choices available youll be safe with this one though perhaps not at the very highest quality this selection will make quite the welcome addition to a cozy fall gatheringthe founder of laposse is italian
in keeping with my current philosophy of buying any and all chocolate in brightly coloured packaging i picked this bar up in waitrose attracted by the bright green logo on the frontas it turns out its actually pretty goodas you can see the bar itself isnt much to look at no fancy designs on the chunks just an ordinary looking block of milk chocolate the finish is matte rather than glossy but it looks well made it comes sealed in plastic and the bar releases the rather pleasant aroma of limes when you rip it open not too much  just enough to tempt you inthis is a  cocoa solids chocolate with  milk solids and the taste and texture are really quite pleasant  not too sweet and not too creamybut the best part of it is how the milk chocolate lime and chilli flavours go together i was worried that the lime and milk chocolate would jar but they go together perfectly neither flavour obliterates the other and as the chocolate melts away the heat from the chilli slowly buildsby the time the chocolate has gone youre left with a very nice chilli kick its much warmer than some of the chilli chocolate bars ive tasted recently but it stops short of inflicting physical pain the warmth lingers for a while until all your left with is a hint of lime flavour that draws you in for another chunkall in all this is worth trying particularly for chilli fans its a bit of a shame they still feel the need to write a short essay explaining how awesome they are on the back of the box but i guess you cant have everythinghave good information on a good site would be useful to people thank youthe best chocolate ive had  tangy tongue and a sweaty forehead im also a fan of lindt sea salt and dolfin pink peppercornoh and sainsburys swiss milk chocolate  pistachio  my friend loves pistachio but doesnt like this bar because it tastes like marzipan  i love both especially marzipan so yeah
a quick check on the web sit shows a range of all sorts of yummy goodness including the rather intriguing yard of chocolate that sounds like a challenge for another day anyhow a small bag of ginger in rich dark chocolate was found one day by the lady of the house and borne home triumphantly for me to check and check i havefirstly  my criteria for a chocolate ginger are like one of those grizzled grumps from the military  tough but fair specifically i want to see some actual ginger not essence of ginger flavour i want a decent chocolate coating  that means it needs to be fairly thick and the chocolate must be dark milk chocolate and ginger is just not right given the judging criteria then and with a few other choccy gingers having been checked as part of my obsession it was time to give mr hilliers finest a gostarting with the ingredients list  the chocolate is  of contents good box ticked there is real ginger in there preserved  dried so it has a bit of sugar thats ok the chocolate is  cocoa solids acceptable more would be better the strange thing is the  milk fat  what on earth is that all aboutin size and shape each is a nice round sphere  not perfectly formed but thats fine  and about the size of a small marble perhaps a little smaller that means the piece of ginger inside is actually pretty small it also means that a  gram bag contains a heck of a lot of themusing the  method of chocolate eating  slow sucking  the chocolate melts away reasonably quickly this is hardly surprising seeing as it is middling dark and perhaps that milk fat helps it along letting it all melt away leaves the piece of ginger in the middle which packs a very nice punch using the  method of chocolate eating  crunching and munching  gives a completely different impression the chocolate and ginger dont mix quite as well as they could perhaps the balance in quantity of chocolate and ginger is not quite right more ginger neededin spite of my tiny reservation above ive still managed to eat  the bag while writing this review and only sheer willpower has made me stop to leave a few for tomorrow my hand keeps wandering back toward the pack  shades of doctor strangelove and his automatic hand going out of controltheyre good very good and id take these in preference to the lindt any time high praise indeedlove the dr strangelove reference  some candy is just like that isntcreates an eating compulsionmy gran loved chocolate and ginger as a combination and every time i have one i think of her ernest hillier do a really good version the chocolate part of it is amazing
i picked these up from waitrose and as you might have guessed it was the bright yellow packaging with cats on that caught my eye having never heard of monty bojangles i had no idea what to expect but i can never say no to a bright yellow boxinside that box we have rather intriguingly a shiny foil bag its obviously designed to preserve freshness but it doesnt exactly scream luxury at youinside the bag we have g of french luxury truffles i put that in quotes partly because thats how the box describes them but mainly because theyre packaged in the uk not luxury and not really truffles the first ingredient listed on the box is vegetable oilbut the truffles themselves look quite appealing dusted in dark cocoa powderthe first thing to hit your tastebuds is the taste of dark chocolate from the cocoa powder that quickly gives way to the rich smokey toffeecaramel flavour of the truffle itself the texture is firm and ultra smooth feeling cool and creamy on the tongue  almost like a ganache made entirely with cream rather than something containing vegetable oilembedded into the truffle are lots of tiny little pieces of hard toffee which are equally tasty i could have done without them though as they are extremely hard and tend to grate the roof of your mouth while youre swirling the truffle around i think i can live with a little pain for the sake of this level of yumminess thoughmy head tells me i shouldnt like these but my mouth is telling me to go and buy more make of that what you willmy sentiments exactly i didnt want to like these as much as i did what with all the lard and all but then chocolates not supposed to be a source of nourishment after all so i forgave myselfyou can get these plain also orange and cookie flavours although i failed to see what cookies had to do with them sharp bits would have been more apt but you prob already know that unless you were waltzing round with your eyes closedjust had these truffles from their easter egg i love the truffles but the chocolate in the easter egg was far from quality very disappointedyeah i dont know what it is with chocolate makers putting sharp bits in soft centres im fully expecting to see a smooth milk chocolate with slivers of razor blade and broken glass soonwow those look so much like the trader joes french trufflesthey do look like the trader joe ones i wonder if theres a big factory in france making these things and just putting them in differently branded boxes
as i was staring deep into the candys heart and soul aka the filling to make a deeper connection with it i noticed that the very outer part of the nougat is different from the rest it looks more like cookie dough perhaps its the insulation compared with a  musketeers this nougat is less fluffy its more chewy and a bit more solid except for being less sticky its a little similar to eating stiff caramel not better or worse than the other nougat just differentso im sold  no longer will i look more harshly on the whipps than the other candy shelf finds the peanut butter cups are still better but candy is for fun anyway and variety so long as it tastes good makes it more funobviously long overdue but the cookie doughesque coating on the outside of the nougat is peanut butter 
now for the chocolate does anyone remember the pop rocks candy from the s it was rather a big hit when i was a child and came in a whole assortment of colours and often sickly flavours this bar from israels most wellknown chocolate family the cow label chocolate is loaded with this popping sensation as implied by the little fireworks on the wrapping  you can actually see the little bits of popping candy inside the chocolate and i must admit i was worried i was in for yet another sickly experience remembering the chemical flavours i used to love so much back in my more sugarobsessed daysall in all this is a pleasant experience the chocolate is nice enough not exactly gourmet but perfectly palatable while the popping candy effect is certainly fun even if it is a bit gimmicky kids certainly love it and i must admit it gave me fond memories of being an s child and was all in all rather good funoh thats interesting ill be reviewing something else that has popping candy for chocolate week next weekwe have a cadbury milk chocolate with popping candy in australia my kids love it it certainly is a most unusual sensationi bought one of those a few weeks ago its in my chocolate fridge i was waiting for it to cool off here a bit morei love these candy bars and always ask people to bring them back from israel for mei thought they were supposed to look like that lol
of course the chocolate was delicious and by the time i got there the crowds had already made a significant dent in the stock but i did manage to buy a few bars to take home and try myselfand knowing that simon would probably rather bite his own arms off than review a white chocolate i thought id review this one myselfas you can see it features the same packaging design by holly herself of course and format as the rest of the range and it really does look rather good those little holes and imperfections just serve to make it look like it was made with love by hand and add to the appeal for me unlike the snazzy pink foil that simons came in though mine was sealed in clear plastic i suspect the foil is more expensive and the plastic increases shelf life but i do much prefer foilwrapped chocolate it looks so much nicer and its easier to recycleas youd expect the chocolate itself  cocoa solids and  milk solids is very sweet and very creamy the main flavour here though is the cinnamon which i hadnt expected the cranberries themselves while quite big dont have quite as much flavour as i would have liked i cant help thinking a little bit more tangy zing would have helped cut through that sweet creaminessbut if youre buying a white chocolate that sweetness is probably exactly what youre looking for so while its not really to my personal taste its made with quality ingredients and white chocolate fans will love it  and its a good introduction to the rest of the rangeoh no my favourite thing cinnamon together with my least favourite thing white chocolate oh the humanity ive never had a white chocolate with cinnamon in it im going to have to see if i can get holly to ship me a few thanks for the link to the sitejust curious i noticed the bubbles on the top of the chocolate the holes on the top  did anyone else notice when eating chocolate does anyone pay as much attention to how it looks as i do or people focus mostly on flavor when it comes to chocolategjergji if it was a mass produced chocolate i would certainly have pointed the holes out but this is a handmade bar produced entirely by one person and i think it adds to the characterand knowing that simon would probably rather bite his own arms off than review a white chocolate i thought id review this one myselfnice  
mmmmmm i hear you say cashew  cherry a fabulous combo in a family block from the supermarket lead me to themdont get me wrong there is nothing wrong with this product its a nice affordable perfectly edible well made chocolate from a big company but it does not inspireit might have cashew nut but not big pieces little sort of crushed ground up lumps like we used to get in plastic packets to put on icecream sundaes back in  boringit might have cherry but not pieces of any kind i could really find not luscious maybe a tiny hint of flavour but nothing special boringcompetently made slightly nutty slightly fruity easily edible mediumdark and boring id happily buy this again to scarf down when feeling fickle and avoiding cadbury but i would not buy it to grab and enthuse about the taste sensation oh wow cashew nut and cherry because really on that front its a bit disappointingawesome chocolate and fast became a favourite  it seems to be disappearing from supermarket shelves though  please dont withdraw it yet its really nice
wel this is interesting this new range of after dinner chocolates from bendicks seem to be more than a superficial rebranding rather than just change the packaging a little theyve introduced this new bitter range of dark chocolates with a whopping  cocoa solidsas you can see this new range comes in handy trafficlight style packaging with each of the g tubes containing eight individually and colourfully wrapped chocolatesim going to start with the mint as thats the most common flavour for this kind of after dinner chocolate they have a pleasantly minty aroma which while noticeable isnt as intense as some other peppermint chocolates ive tasted the chocolate has a slightly matte finish and that comes through in the texture its not as smooth as a chocolate with a lower cocoa content but its by no means grainyit is very difficult to get a handle on the flavour though because as soon as you bite a piece off the mint flavour starts to take over there doesnt appear to be any natural sweetness in the chocolate but the intense peppermint sweetness of the thick fondant filling quickly counters any bitterness the overall effect is something that isnt particularly chocolatey but is genuinely quite refreshing in the red corner we have the bittergingers these are exactly the same size and shape and use the same  dark chocolate the fondant filling is the same consistency as the mints  a firm slightly crumbly slightly chewy consistency that works well as it melts at a similar rate to the chocolate the ginger is delicious if perhaps not quite as intense as the mints it also builds more slowly and subtly and leaves a wonderful warm feeling in the mouthfinally we have the bitteroranges with the added attraction of a hint of chilli as you can see from the photo this is the only one with a hint of colour  probably from the orange peel the flavour is of natural oranges and quite subtle theres nothing over the top here  even the chilli is just right  like the bittergingers it just leaves a nice warmth in the mouth once the chocolate and fondant have melted awaythose not used to very dark chocolate might have a problem with these but i loved them most chocolates that market themselves as bitter or intense have weird and wacky fillings but in this case most of the intensity comes from the chocolate itself and i find that rather refreshingits great to see high cocoa content chocolate being used in new products although i would have liked to see more information on country of origin and the kind of beans used on the packaging this range would certainly make an interesting addition to any dinner party  just be sure to buy all three flavours and let your guests discuss the flavour combinations the conversation could go on all nighti keep want to start this comment with good or nice or great but none of these seems strong enough or appropriate enough for what you just postedjust fantastic and mindblowing blog keep it upi a agree with the prior assessment your mints bitter orange are superb what do they cost in the usfd mwhere can i buy bitter ginger and bitter orange chocolates in norfolk today
as thomas said in his mail to me it is also our passion for chocolate and chocolates in general that made us go for this product together with the urge of showing the world that belgium is capable of more than producing the worlds most complex governmentof course we already know that belgium is home to some of the worlds finest chocolate makers which naturally led me to conclude that i was in for a treatmore from thomasthe reason why the site is currently in english only is because i worked for a multinational briefly with several colleagues from the uk each time i went on a work visit to the uk they asked me to bring chocolates from belgium  so i knew there was demand the uk is close by its a big market so its our mission to make these wonderful chocolates available to a wide audience were just starting off with the shop so we hope to get some uk traffic by the holiday season in belgium there are chocolatiers all over the place  not as good as frederic but still good enough for people not to look further than their local shop thats why we do not focus on belgiumone thing that is worth mentioning is that these chocolates were excellently packaged a stout cardboard box was home to a polystyrene box surrounded by soft packing material the inner box was taped closed and held the actual ballotin when i lifted it for the first time i was immediately impressed with the weight thats because m blondeel or maybe thomas himself had managed to cram in no fewer than twenty three individual pieces i shant go into detail about every single piece but its true to say that these are indeed top quality chocolates in the classic belgian mode with a few modern twists all of the chocolate used is smooth well balanced and full of flavour there were of course a few surprises among the classics and a couple of these are worth a mentionthere was a dark chocolate and spearmint ganache which was so alive with the most natural mint flavour i have come across in a long time the flavours sat together perfectly and were a shining example of why mint and chocolate should be paired rarely have i tasted it done so well thougha milk chocolate ganache with cinnamon held the balance between the smoothness of the milk chocolate and the warm spice of cinnamon perfectly as the shell melted away the centre liquified in my mouth releasing cocoa and spice notes that were reminiscent of chaithis slender square concealed a tangerine i believe centre with tiny pieces of zest which delivered a gorgeous citrus burst fresher and lighter than traditional chocolateorange pairings and dangerously moreishmore belgian tradition in the form of a snail shell there are a number of novelty shapes in m blondeels range was home to half a caramelised walnut surrounded by caramel the nut was crisp and freshtasting and in combination with the light liquid caramel and thick milk chocolate shell it had me smiling as i allowed the flavours to slowly spread over my tonguea white chocolate heart with a burnt sugar finish didnt really seem like it was going to be my kind of thing but it cunningly held a darkdark ganache centre with layers of thin crisp crepe very much reminiscent of a hotel chocolat or pascal caffet chocolate i thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this oneof all the dark chocolates i tried this one was the ultimate new taste the three discs are slivers of crisp nougat which sit atop a mound of caramel all of which is balanced on a chewy nutty base the fact that all of this is smothered in rich dark chocolate with a superb soft mouthfeel just makes the whole thing devastatingly moreish  in fact truth be told had i just received the chocolates i have spoken of i would have been very happy but here were many other great flavours  a blackcurrant ganache which was bright sharp and tangy classic belgian pralines coffee ganaches with light fragrant coffee aromas a number of pieces that made great use of nuts and morechocolateque is doing the rounds on the chocolate sites isnt it jim reviewed a similar lot of chocolates just the other day i guess it is one way to grow your brand via the internetim always on the lookout for cinnamon flavoured chocolates unfortunately they always tend to be rather bland and i can never pick up any cinnamon taste at all this one sounds promising though i dont imagine that these will be available in australia any time soon sadly have you heard of createmychocolatecom its a german company chocride that makes customized chocolate and they offer cinnamom and cinnamon cornflakes as ingredients which is a pretty awesome cinnamonny combination if you ask me the german online shop is pretty popular and they are launching in the us in january afaik i am not quite sure if they deliver to australia though
but at least this is different from just promoting chocolate as generically healthy the fact that its chocolate is secondary in this case it seems that the university of ghent in belgium did an experiment that showed chocolate to let you take in  of probiotics while milk and yogurts were only  what are probiotics ive always known them as the opposite of antibiotics instead of trying to get rid of the bad bacteria you strengthen the good so they help with the immune system and digestioneach of these boxes is a twoweek supply thats one fourteen gram bar a day presumably you dont want to be eating more when its for health benefits the rectangles are marked into four not to give you lines to break the chocolate along but to make it look bigger at least that looks like the function to me the milk chocolate isnt bad it tastes belgian nutty and creamy not overly sweet or anything just right its greasy though oh horror at least if youre sticking to the fourteen grams there wont be that much grease to build upthe dark chocolate is in the same plain packaging just a little bit darkercolored as usual im either tougher on the dark or its tougher to get right the first time i didnt even want to finish the small bar later it was okay its pretty sweet hence the brand name sweetlife but maybe not in an overwhelming way it falls in with the average dark chocolate crowdso if youre looking for a way to get probiotics by all means give the maramor an ohiobased company line a try if you like having chocolate as part of your diet but want to be getting something else out of it these would be good at  per box dont get them solely for the tastecomments are closed
there now doesnt that make you feel better want one difficult because although mr robern menz makes about  million of these things each year but they are not sold all that far and wide desperate expats resort to things like relatives to send surreptitious parcels of them around the worldive been known to make myself sick on fruchocs although its not the chocolate that causes the trouble and it does require scoffing down about a whole bagful in a sitting no that yummy peach and apricot centre does all the damage what kind of damage is left to your imagination mind you  i used to work with a chap who would go buy a bag from the local vending machine and eat the lot in about  seconds now he had the constitution of an ox but i digresshow how could the humble fruchoc be improved an impossible task a herculean effort perhaps infuse it with the finest nectar from the rarest flowers perhaps a shimmer of gold leaf as a coatingthese little babies are quite a bit harder to find than the regular fruchoc the chocolate is  cocoa and in spite of being packed in a plain plastic bag hung off the supermarket shelf they have been glazed with   whatever that is  which keeps them from having the white marks of chocolate that gets a bit knocked around so they come out nice and shiny the chocolate is sweet but not excessively so simple slow melting and the apricotpeach centre is the same sweet driedfruit softchewy texture that all fruchocs havestick a pack of these in front of family while they are watching inspector morse and they are all gone in a flashblissive never had original fruchocs but these dark chocolate ones sound like where i should start
this box  found in tesco  caught my eye because it epitomises everything i dislike about this kind of marketing the box is plastered with logos and health claims to a point where the packaging just looks cheap and tackyacticoa is a product of barry callebaut the worlds largest chocolate manufacturer which is specifically formulated to have higher levels of antioxidants annoyingly the acticoa web site itself makes yet more dubious health claims including keeps you young and fit and protects the brain seriouslymarketing hype aside whats more important is how they taste thankfully the answer is pretty goodonce you bite into the chocolate that initial bitterness is immediately counteracted by a sweet tangy fruitiness that is really rather nice the flavour is more orange than cranberry but its a natural orange flavour like fresh orange juice the cranberries have a wonderful texture theyre soft light and chewy and the overall effect is a little like a fruity chocolate covered jelly baby theyre really moreish i ended up having to hide the box in the back of the cupboard to stop me eating them in one sittingto sum up id like to see hadleigh maid tone down the health claims and design a prettier box because theyre a really tasty little snack and id recommend them on that basis alonecomments are closed
guest chocablogger michael edwards from canda takes a look at something localthese days however they seem to be reinventing themselves to capitalise on the current popularity of chocolate and that means adding a new range of chocolate bars including toffee crunch the aforementioned french mint and the mandatory  although surprisingly available with and without cocoa nibs and  my local shop didnt have any of the more exciting ones so i decided to stick with the  trying both versionsthe packaging is really rather dull and not very inspiring something that did help to keep my expectations down with just a slight difference in colour between the boxes for each bar the hermetically sealed foil inner packaging also reinforced that mass produced level of anticipation that usually precedes disappointmentthe taste doesnt quite deliver on that early potential though the flavour collapses far too quickly and while the chocolate melts away smoothly there isnt much left behind to remind you of what just happened thats why the bar with nibs gets the nod of the head  having a few crunchy mementos to bite away at really does help compensate all in all not a bad attempt and good enough to make me want to go back in to try out the other bars when they finally show up in my local laura secord shopplease 
guest chocablogger natasha faria from south africa looks at a local offeringwhich is exactly what this chocolate is achingly headacheinducingly sweet not too surprising when sugar is the first ingredient on the list and cocoa is sixth upon slicing it open it becomes clear that the picture on the wrapper is either an intoxicated artists representation of what chocolate should be or it is photoshopped to create the impression of a rich decadent chocolate simply bursting with yummy fillingsthe truth is a little different the filling makes up very little of the chocolate and there are not even biscuits in every square the chocolate shell is almost grainy and the vegetable fats and vegetable oil tend to leave a slightly bitter taste in the back of ones mouth bleh the fact that milk solids are a significant ingredient doesnt tend to help it too much in fact this makes me think of the easter bunnies we used to make at school to raise funds for whatever  in other words cooking chocolate it even has that reminiscent hint of peanut butter which is probably just the vegetable oil talking honestly i was looking forward to this as i though the filling was quite inventive trying the filling on its own provided a pleasant surprise however the very scientifically named biscuit bits according to the wrapper are nice and crunchy although calling them biscotti may be a bit optimistic the caramel filling is more along the lines of a caramel flavoured cream and together with the biscuits its not bad at all i think its safe to conclude that at r compared to cadburys r youre getting what you pay forby a strange coincidence i happened to have a bar of this in my stash i just opened it it really is incredibly sweet and theres some well interesting after tastes going onat last someone who can write in such a beautiful descriptive way that i dont even have to buy the chocolate to taste it lindt makes  cocoa chocolate divine this is a  blog keep it upmmmmmm just reading this i can taste it in my mouth so with a cheaptasting chocolate outer and delicious filling is it safe to say its whats on the inside that counts excellent first blogginggood article i was almost curling up in horror  you might say its reminiscent of cooking chocolate but actually it sounds to me like cooking chocolate might be better makes note to self time to review some cooking chocolatesjust like dom i also have  bars of this in my suitcasei buy it almost everyday for lunch and today i decided to have it with breakfastim crazy about it i guess the filling was what hooked me at first and you are right the perfect exaggerated wrapper is so attractive
i have to say i love the packaging design of this bar though the box got a little smashed when it was sent out to me i love the color palette a soft and dark gray eggplant purple with a splash of pink and silver then all the flowering vines with the leafy tree standing above the earth very nicely done the original beans designer at least has my praisetheir ceo lesal ruskey puts it as a way for the consumer to become engaged in the world around them and assume a leadership role in conservation through a super premium chocolate thats why when you open up the triangular flap on the back theres a green printout inside that explains the work original beans named for the prechocolate industry beans that grew in rainforests does preventing deforestation and the liketheres also a lot number to put into their site to see the benefits your specific lot is causing like another time i came across one of these lot numbers it didnt work not even the same company so i have no idea why this is so much for finding out about the trees my chocolate origin the congo saved each bar is supposed to plant one treeunfortunately the pr company forgot that arizona is hot overnight shipping doesnt cut it without insulationcool packs when youre in the s and s all but a couple of hours in the wee time of the night so my poor chocolate arrived in liquid form it was very good liquid though quite tempting in itself with such gentle richness but i had to stop myself and send it to the refrigerator to coax out a normal state its picture then only serves to show its medium dark brown colori think this is my new most expensive bar of chocolate at  grams im only finding it for  online though a couple of places call it a  bar im not sure id guess it from the taste its fullbodied if something sweeter than id expected tasting notes are mulberry cara cara orange and honeysuckle in that order at least i can only assume the orange is in the middle im not picking it up at all mulberry and honeysuckle definitely though whereas most of my pricier ventures have been extremely slowmelting this one is the opposite it liquifies so quickly in your mouth maybe that added to its hard time in the mail it certainly has a unique delivery in fact it tastes just like the box design looks fashionably sophisticated while still prettyit seems to me that youre paying for a cause just as much as a chocolate as long as you take that in stride i can see this bar fitting in with many peoples favorites after all it is good to be thinking about kindness to people and the earthcomments are closed
sacrilege end of review oh you want more ok thenthats a real word stop looking at me like thati do wish that confectionary companies would stop copying products that have been available on the market for years surely it isnt too difficult to produce something new and innovativei agree i dont think mcvities have any kind of trademark on jaffa cake but the colour design and lack of a bahlsen logo on the pack is clearly designed to confuse people
or albert heijn excellent zwitserse melkchocolade met stroopwafelsmaak in original dutchbeing a fan of both chocolate and the famous dutch honey waffles the ones that go on top of your cup of coffee so that they go all warm and soft in the middle i got really excited when i was given this bar in my minds eye or  mouth i envisioned the perfect combination of flavours and textures  because what could be nicer than a sticky waffle covered in chocolateboy was i wrong this thin bar is composed of what can only be described as cheap bland chocolate and some kind of sickly syrup that instantly leaves a bad taste in your mouth if only it disappeared as quickly as it appeared this is a far cry from the implied quality of either of those ingredients i am not sure what the crunchy bits are in the chocolate but they certainly werent any kind of actual waffle perhaps if i could read the dutch ingredients list id have been spared the disappointment i felt after eating this it tastes nothing like the waffles and frankly not much like chocolate either its just a hit of unbearable sickly sweetness that will stay with you until you clear your palate with something more well palatablei suddenly have the urge to melt some good quality chocolate over a dutch honey wafflemmmme too amazing how a negative review can still make you hungry bummer  the packaging looks so good too
the blurb on the box mercifully brief and unpretentious promises notes of cashew and honey it has a sweetness and a long finish naturally they are correct the honeyed nutty flavours come through as soon as this hits the tongue being so thin it requires no effort at all  no chewing require sit a sliver of this on your tongue and in seconds the rich semisweet cocoa flavours are upon you it has the same semisweet taste complex as the santander bar with a prolonged finish which holds the sweetness for a while then ends with woody slightly bitter cocoa highsthe mouthfeel is superb light as a whisper on the palate and packed full of quite complex flavours they really arent lying when they mention cashews either if youre relatively new to dark chocolate and want the flavour without the full body this is ideal similarly if you love to try single origin bars i would recommend this as an excellent example of colombian cocoaah thanks maggie  ive added a buy online link to the postdomori rulesit might be the best dark chocolate you can get from italyeverything lve tried so far has been really excellentsuprisingly little ingridients but superbmaximum tastewonderfull
as you can see it follows the standard chunky form factor one giant finger of chocolate wafer and filling theres no cocoa content listed but i can tell you that the bar comprises  filling  wafer and  milk chocolate i dont really know why this is important but it seems like nestl feel that quantity is more important than quality  at least as far as labelling is concernedwell frankly thats a load of old tosh because there isnt a hint of caramel here its fudge all the way downthe blurb also tells me that  kitkats are eaten every second that sounds like a challenge to mehaving said all that i kinda like it obviously its really sweet being roughly  sugar thats why they say its intense but its quite enjoyable the chocolate is okish the wafer is crispy and the filling is interesting its much lighter and less stodgy than the peanut butter bar i might not rush out to buy one myself but thats primarily because i still have four of them sat here on my deskhmmm ive tried the australian version of this and from memory it had the flowing kind of caramel and not fudge i may be mistaken as it was some months back i do remember that i liked it very much thoughoh i love these i cannot get enough of them i love chunky kit kats as it is and these are just another type to add to the stash in the office drawer mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmchristine id guess that the australian version is effectively a completely different product that just happens to have the same name at the very least theyre going to be made in different factories with ingredients from different supplierscalling all music fans  my name is leanne and i work alongside kit kat and thought you all might be interested in hearing about the new music promotion thats running on pack you can download mp songs of your choice for free all you have to do is buy a promotional kit kat with a special digit code inside register online browse the online library and choose your song the songs are yours to keep and can be used on any music device you can download up to five free songs so next time you buy a kit kat keep the code so you can log online and get downloadingkitkat is one of my favorites they are so crunchy i cant think about life without these sweetsi love them and there is no fuge in ittaking it srslyi cant say the caramel chunky in the uk is anything close to the quality of the uk peanut butter variety when trying the caramel chunky i found it to be harsh leaving a burning sensation on the back of my palate i gave it one more bite but could not finish the bar the wafer  chocolate are completely overpowered by the caramel flavouring this was not the case with the peanut butter which seems to blend with a nice balance you were still able to taste the wafer as a fan of the peanut butter kitkat in fact i would choose it over any other candy bar i resent seeing the new caramel chunkys in stores where the calm yellow peanut butter chunkys used to be even the new reflective wrapper seems to have a negative effect on the whole experience i have also noticed that the caramel chunkys are struggling to be sold at my local tos the opposite was true of the peanut butter versionif anyone from nestle uk is reading this  bring back the peanut butter chunkeeees  before its too latehi im american wass uphi am amercanhi american lilly im south africanyum o this  is soo yuuummmmmmmmmmmmmyyyyyyyy i love iti love these this sweet is the best thing in my life infact if i had to marry this kitkat chunky caramel i wouldi one tried it and it was delicious not as nice as cadbury crunchie but very nice

this strange baron chocolate turned up the other day  not my find the lady of the house was out and about and found it in one of the ultralowcost discount stores gocrazycheaplowaschips  or some such you know the sort  everything strange you ever dreamed of and everything under a dollar or two yes thaaaaaat kind of storea quick google search shows that these seem to show up in other countries too  i found a reference to them selling for  canadian each in similar lowprice stores  and getting good reviews too this is another chocolate from poland  i speculated before on this being some national industry this only seems to bear that outon the trying it side of things although its sold as dark chocolate it is only  cocoa solids which is not really very dark there is no milk at all though so i guess the rest is sugar and such like and it is pretty sweetso the conclusion is much the same wots it like then like the kinnertons  pretty good sweet but not ridiculously so nothing to rave about nothing to avoid either just a pleasant easy to eat chocolate at a wonderful pricebaron is a nd or even rd class choco from poland believe me yes i have no doubt its perfectly edible and very very cheap there are certainly better much better and there are worse if you want a cheap choc hit this is fine if you want to pay  times the price you can do a lot betteri am eatting baron chocolate with almonds it tastes okay it isnt hersey but oh welljust bought a  cocoa solids baron chocolate cost me  at the market and it was pretty good
now lets return to that peanut butter filling theres quite a bit of it spilling out almost liquidly when its fresh if youre like me on the other hand itll harden to a more regular peanut butter state before its gone still tastes good though its a very light tan color just a shade lighter and it would be offwhite very smooth especially in this aforestated freshness buttery taste finished with an explosion of peanuts given that the chocolate is thick very thick on the sides and the filling is soft the two flavors dont necessarily combine much they end up as separate acts in your mouth here i think is the reason they take me so long to finish you can get the chocolate and peanut butter together if you bite off tiny pieces from the thick shell while licking the filling treat it a little more like a lollipop or ice cream cone that makes it a captivating sweetso jealous these look amazing its a shame chocolate and peanut butter isnt as big in the uk as it is in the usthat does look amazingi love these treats at rocky mountain chocolatebut wish they were a little cheaper lolit really does have some of the best peanut butter filling and though i agree with you becca that rocky mountain can be pricey this is one thing i still find myself willing to pay for
i did rather like the choice of colour for the foil i might add i wonder if hollys customers are primarily female or whether she just chose this rather lovely pink as a continuation of the colour scheme for the packagingbased on this first encounter im very much looking forward to my next chocoholly bar which will be a milk chocolate confection she was kind enough to send a few thingsdid someone say free chocolate im therefree chocolate close to work i know now what ill be doing at lunchtime tomorrow maggie  holly i may come along too if i can find the timei love chili and chocolate and coconut so will definitely be trying this one
once removed from the shiny sparkly wrapper wispa gold looks quite dull theres no markings no fancy design or interesting patterns no nothing i would go so far as to say its the most boring looking chocolate in the history of everythinginside things get marginally more interestingas you can see the gold in question is a thin layer of caramel the tagline on the wrapper calls it a cheeky layer of caramel i have no idea what cheeky means in this context but judging by the caramel itself i would have to guess at really sweet and runnythe overall result is something thats quite different from a regular wispa you dont get that light almost velvety texture but you do get a little variation in taste and texture  something the original wispa has never had its still light enough that its not overly sickly and i managed to scoff my way through this g bar with easei was  when this bar was first launched in  so it wasnt really part of my childhood if it was part of yours then it will almost certainly bring back happy memories but i cant see myself craving another in the foreseeable futuregreat review dom i really enjoyed readin it i just hope that this relaunch is a success i really want to see the wispa mint come backyeah its one of those things id really like to see hang around even though its not really my thing in the same way id be devastated if curly wurly disappeared even though i havent bought one since i was  i love the original wispa bars because of their aerated texture and personally i think the addition of caramel completely ruins it you lose that great mouth feel and as you said it just becomes a slightly different version of the cadburys dairy milk with caramelby the way dom  is chocablog still hiring new people or have you already filled the vacancies do i still have time to applylaura longtime reader firsttime commenterand keep commenting we love comments i bought one of these this morning out of curiosity have to say i was a little bit disappointed the ratio of caramel and chocolate was perfect they havnt spared the caramel but i just couldnt put my finger on what wasnt right until i deconstructed my last inch of it and realised that the carmel has absolutely no taste what so eververy disappointing indeed ill be sticking with the pure wispa in future and getting my caramel hit elsewherei tell you what might be nice a dark chocolate wispa with seasalted caramelcome on cadbury i know youre listening reading this means i never have to buy one out of nostalgic curiosity how well i recall the lack of interesting flavours and dull dull milk chocolate i think if i was given one of these id be hard pressed to finish the blighter can you imagine cadburys ever going near sea salted caramel and good quality dark chocolate in one bar okay i know the posh dark cadbury chocolate i reviewed at the beginning of the year was good but we cant get that here never mind anything vaguely different or adventurouswe did have such a thing in australia once pretty much identical actually the cadbury crave it was discontinued a few years ago and now no one seems to remember it but it was a favourite of minewispa golds just come to australia under the radar its in coles  i just had my first bar  i love it  i dont think cadburys meant for it to come out here  would love to try the mint nownever heard of that one yumohand the dark sea salt ideanow i would love to try thatwhat a great idea domthe crave was my favorite candy bar when i went to australia years ago it never came out in the states and i have been trying to figure out where i could get some more now i can stop my search after discovering that they have been discontinuedmy life will never bee the samei was devastated when they took it off the market and i actually wrote to cadbury to find out why well obviously that didnt workwell after  years its about time its back and hopefully here to stay talk about excitement when i saw it yr old and was jumping up and down like a kidyeah i know a bit pathetici think wispa golds are gorgeous and outshine the normal wispa  i like the fact they are exactly the same as they always have been not smaller thinner etc as for the caramel tasting of nothing i couldnt agree less lol its delicious  lovely wispa   yummy cadburys caramel  winner i completely disagree i could eat wisper golds all day every day they are the best chocolates ever i wish that they would be brought back to australia i keep checking in coles every week to see if they are back please bring back wispa golds my family my work mates all my mates and myself are looking forward to them being back on the shelves mmmmmmmm tasty goods are my rightim in australia and found it at a coles in late march here in one of the suburbs of canberra  it was the only bar i can even have on my diet  then they removed itthe good news is the iga down the road from me is currently stocked with cadbury twisted creme egg bars imported from the uk similar to the limited edition wispa gold that i saw months agoi have reviewed these in more detail on my blog copy and paste link belowglutenfreesoyfreewordpresscomcremeeggtwistedaglutenfreesoyfriendlychocolatedelightps  dom if i could offer you a suggestion you might want to consider linking to cadbury uk somewhere in your blog  if their it technical staff are up to it theyll receive an alert and someone from their production team will probably most definitely read this post
these langues de chats a pun in itself langues de chats  are a french biscuit come in white milk and dark chocolate and i had been sent a tin of large dark ones and a tiny tin of  little milk chocolate ones the milk ones were given to a friends children with a demand for one word from each of them to describe the taste yummy creamy and lovely were duly offeredthis tin contained  dark chocolate praline filled langues each of which continued the comic cat theme to the lastas you can see the tin is a generous addition  definitely made to keep after all of the contents are long deceased each langue is individually wrapped  excelllent for little treats or stocking fillers perhapsonce id finished grinning back at the crazy cat face it was time to attackas you can see the praline filling is a rich creamy confection which is the colour of gingerbread its loaded with deep buttery nuttiness and compliments the lightly flavoured  cocoa dark chocolate coating perfectly im not sure these would appeal to younger palates very much but slightly older children might find themselves deserting sweeter less heallthy chocolate as a novelty gift possibly for  those who still prefer their dark chocolate adulerated or on the lighter side theyre a good choice however at almost p per chocolate theyre probably likely to be a gift rather than an indulgenceif youre looking for something a bit different for a present for someone particularly someone who likes cats then look no further i would hope that these flavours are available elsewhere in the galler range because otherwise there might be a lot of people who never get to taste themok now thats just bizarre
looking at the ingredients it looks like theyre still using the same  milk chocolate as well i guess when youve been in business for  years you dont rush into making changes even when you receive a negative chocablog review i know shocking isnt itone of my main complaints in that previous review was that that the truffles were just a bit bland for something so expensive and for the milk chocolate truffles i could argue once again that  for eight fairly basic chocolates is just a little over the topso this is another negative review rightnot a bit of it because while the milk chocolate truffles are quite simply nice the banoffee ones are to die for the moment you open the box youre hit by that unmistakable aroma of banoffee pie and they taste every bit as good as they smellif i had one criticism it would be that the truffle filling is a little firm but really all that does is prolong the deliciousness of the experience pop a whole truffle into your mouth and let it melt slowly and the chocolate and banoffee high will keep you going for at least as long as a piece of real banoffee piei can take or leave the milk chocolate truffles but ended up consuming the whole box of banoffees before lunch more like this please charbonnel you have my addressif i hadnt read your review about this chocolate i probably wouldnt have even wanted to try it  among us chocolatiers having a thick cocoa shell is a no no  thanks for the post ill try to see if i can get some in the uswow ive not heard about these banoffee chocs before but they sound absolutely delicious
the milk chocolate cocoa content undisclosed is fairly run of the mill stuff  pleasant enough but unremarkable the addition of the liqueur obviously means that any subtlety of flavour that the chocolate may have had and if theyre not telling us how much cocoa it contains then its unlikely to have been that sophisticated is overridden by the stronger fruitalcohol pairingits well its okay something a bit different to bring home from your travels which is exactly what it was certainly not worth repeatingcomments are closed
so what exactly is itwell starting on the outside we have milk chocolate of unknown cocoa content with a good helping of crisped rice nice enough but nothing special  and certainly not the most appetising looking chocolate creation ive seeninside things get a bit weirder the filling is best described as chewy coconut marshmallowy stuff i couldnt make out the greek translation but i bet thats the official descriptionluckily though its also very light and quite small so its quite easy to get through in one go without sharing sharing boo and i found myself really quite enjoying it not posh but the perfect antidote to a midafternoon sugar cravingnot a big fan of milk chocolate but this actually looks goodthis looks a bit like a chokitoive never seen a chokito so i can neither confirm or deny that if you do a search at google images for chokito you get a couple of cross sections that look similar to the image on the derby packetah found some you couldnt really make out the filling on this bar  it certainly wasnt as thick as the wrapper suggests i did try to do a crosssection photo but it didnt look very appealingits my favourite i love derby my sister is sending me all package from greece it has  chocolate bars inside its second week and unfortunately ive got only oneeeeee  its still playing with my mind eat or not to eat agrr best candybar ever this thing has been around since periclesmy name is derby so i was very excited to see these in greece while visiting this weekendjust had one as work a colleague brought them back from holiday awesomei liked that sweet any one can guide me from where can i buy more in englandfor trade enquiry in india state haryana
despite the new stripe in the corner my memory would beg to differ just how long can something be called new anyway a year maybe well ghirardelli it you say this bar is new i guess that makes it newchocolate in the s tends to have a progression of flavors but this one delivers a more constant fluid taste at the moment im really not tasting the bitter but it did give an obvious bitter hit before as compared with the  im getting warm baked chocolate notes i cant always identify my chocolate fruits so ill stick to the description for that part hints of dark cherries dried plums richtasting foods fitting for a dark chocolate midnight reverie reminds me of eating a cake frosting and all a nice cake mind you not a boring box or grocery store varietyi had a very tiny piece of the twilight delight while midnights taste was still in my mouth oh sugar a piece of sugar in my mouth wasnt expecting that it must be then that the biggest difference between the two is sweetness keep in mind that i wouldnt have noticed without the brief experiment but consider yourselves warmed twilight is casual depth with sweetness midnight is casual depth with much less sweetnesscomments are closed
when it comes to football and sponsorship i suppose anything goes even chocolate is not immunewhen it comes to football and me i couldnt care less a bunch of big burly blokes running around assaulting each other for a couple of hours pfftand when it comes to aussie rules football the mighty adelaide crows made it into the finals so it seems only appropriate to check out the official sponsorshiplogo emblazoned chocolate crows complete with colours on the pack and a meanlooking sort of crowslike chapon the inside the results are kind of different to the build upok these are chocolate covered jellylike things but i cant for the life of me see a crow resemblance in the shape can you they must have been cut to this shape after a night at the footy and a few too many celebratory tinniesgo the crowsyou have very strange looking crows in australia funnily enough i bought a packet of these and choccy thundas yesterday at the menz factory in mclaren vale for my parents they both go for opposing sa teams i hope they dont resemble the blobs you have pictured i may just have to open them up  have a little sample to see if mine are the same sorry mum  dadcrikey they look like something that comes out of a crow rather than the footy team mascothehe its like a rawshack test in chocolate sorry that should be rorschach test i probably should have googled the word first to find the correct spelling ive bought these before and i wont do it again  menz produces some yummy stuff namely fruchocs but these are not one of their finest products
my first was the salted caramel and it was an absolute delight deep molasseslike burnt sugars from the caramel that tang of salt and wrapped in a wafer thin dark chocolate shell a really excellent salted caramel which delivered bags of tastethe single origin madagascan trinitario chocolate delivered light fruity top notes characteristic of trinitario soft full flavoured cocoa with no bitterness at all and an easy almost citrus finish thoroughly enjoyable chocolate and very much in the posh choc mould a light crisp chocolate shell concealing a flavour packed whisper light centre lovely stuffi enjoyed these enough to want to try more of laudens chocolates a company making fine chocolate in yorkshire is unusual in itself and warrants further attention methinks and based on this showing i hav high hopes for some of the other flavours lauden offerwatch this spacei tried their chocolates at the summer good food show i loved their single estate chocolate along with their marc de champagne choclates
mms always keep me on my toes  no not because im overly sugared up and high as a kite on cocoa but because they like to release new flavours with very little fanfare normally theyre only spotted when one is trawling up the confectionery aisle at the supermarketthis is how ive found the previously reviewed the delightfully welcome mms dark which are becoming a rare sighting the equally nice mms mint virtually extinct so maybe i was the only person who enjoyed them and the execrable mms mint crispy advertised by pamela anderson who was inexplicably flown out here which have most deservedly been droppedlo and behold i spotted a bright orange packetso how did these orange ones tastedelicious  crackly crunchy on the outside before releasing a zing of orange chocolate that dissolved before the next handful of whites and orange discs were thrown in  they even had a pleasant orange odour when the seal was ripped into and with the chocolate being a minimum of  cocoa solids it paired up extremely well  hint to mms  maybe this would go well in a dark chocolate mm as welli hope this flavour sticks around because theyre a good addition to the mm stable  just dont fly out a permatanned paris hilton to launch them here in australia okaythese do sound goodi may have to go searching for sometheyre worth it  i mean yeah theyre mms so arent likely to be sprinkled atop a matt moran masterchef dessert creation yet but theyre goodi remember trying these mms in their very own chocolate shop in las vegas  my daughter was in heaven  mei was totally mesmerized by the colorful display of chocolate  wall to wall literallyi love orange and chocolate so will definitely keep an eye out for theseive always loved the chocoorange combination this ones a winner im eating it right now hope it sticks around longer too me too kristel because ive noticed that the dark mms have disappeared sobcanada actually has  chocolate mms on the shelves on an ongoing basis but we tend to miss out on all the other variations didnt they make a mint version in the us last year too i really wanted to try thosei have once tried mm mint before loved it sadly it extincts just found this blog entry because i am about to get mms orange d after having read this i really look forward to my bosss return from australia my daughter bought me some of these orange m  ms in n carolina and i absolutely love them but i cant find them anywhere in ohio
as you can see the underside of this block is studded with small pieces of freeze dried raspberry like the box they are bright pink in colour and give each chunk a crispy texture when you bite into itthe raspberry flavour is wonderfully intense building as the pieces hydrate in your mouth this isnt one of those generic fruit flavours its unmistakably raspberry and tangy almost to the point of fizziness as the pieces meltaccording to the pr blurb from thorntons this will be available for a limited time how long i dont know so at  its definitely worth sampling if you happen to be passing your local thorntonsi had to wait until i stopped blushing before replying to this wonderful review we are honored to be spotlighted on chocolate blog your words are as smooth as chocolate
as you can plainly see what we have here is another award winning thorntons product proving that the company is indeed making great strides in reinventing itself as a purveyor of quality goodsso what of the brownies well as you can see on the package theyre a combinaton of cake fudge and chocolate heres what they look like out of the packettheyre small but perfectly formed they look moist and inviting and the chocolate coating is both generous and of suitably high quality these little brownie bites deliver everything youd expect i had my first lot with a good quality vanilla ice cream and they were excellent theres enough of everything to let you know what youre eating and the three principal flavours of chocolate sponge fudge and milk chocolate are perfectly balancedperspnally i feel mini brownies are a rotten tease id prefer full sized ones pleasenever been a fan of store bought chocolate desserts but these actually looks good  perhaps ill break my rule and give it a trybrownies are so easy to get wrong especially out a packet but i tried these for the first time a few weeks ago and they are wonderful  lethal though if youre calorie counting  mini just makes you eat morefirstly simon this seems so well local for such a welltravelled chocoholic like yousecondly i want those  why isnt thorntons branching out in australiai usually wouldnt go with store bought brownies either but i think id make an exception here i could almost lick my screen they look that goodthese are the most beautiful cakes i have ever tasted i am your biggest fan i buy them at asda and end up eating the lot emmmmmm xthe choclate brownies are soft an choclaty when u bite into it then u get this amazing melted choclate at the firm base of it they are to doe for once i went through  packets in one daythese brownies are ruining my life i have a serious addiction to them they taste amazing amazing ive put on so much weight in the last months i cant resist them ive tried i just cantsom help
compared with all the cocoa puffspebblescrispies this cereal is targeted at a more grown population gourmet speaks of indulgence in quality instead of in your inner child and the in my opinion random mention of inulin fiber introduces health benefits usually not in the foreground of childrens cerealsonce its poured out it looks like theres a little less chocolate than in the picturetasting some on its own it isnt very good its frankly quite the opposite its dull and awkward sugar is its first ingredient with butter fat soon following it is meant as a mix though where it does succeed and it is better than other offerings it also turns out that theres enough for every spoonful i really wouldnt want any more than that the flakes are the thicker kind used in healthier cereals full of nice crunches of grains they keep the chocolate grounded enough that it isnt really a sweet cereal chocolate is still a heavy food so i certainly wont be making this a staple cereal its more for switching out to every so often for variety and another good way to get away with chocolate for breakfastbummer  thought for a moment that breakfast cereal might be a good option but it looks like its back to the cheeriossounds to me like i should stick with cocoa puffsmy wife just told me that this cereal is being discontinued at least in the los angeles area that was very sad news as ive been eating this cereal for several months also the chocolate tends to settle at the bottom so if you just opened the box and poured the cereal out thats why you didnt get much im looking at the bottom of the box my mom didnt want go figure and probably my last ever and it has lots of chocolate im eating an extinct cereal
safeway supermarkets aka woolworths in australian states other than victoria have introduced a brand of fun sized chocolates in several varieties that are shameless copies of big sellers and are considerably cheaper than the similarsized bags produced by cadbury and nestl  at first glance none of the names are appealing but the one being scrutinised today is vaultat first i assumed that because they were funsized bars vault meant that it would give you the energy to leap up high in the air and vault over your obstacles and so forth but it seems as though it is instead meant to be a treasure unleashed from a safe whateveringredients panels can often leave a bad taste in my mouth and todays was a tad depressing  whilst it was good to see that nearly a quarter of the bar consisted of peanuts it was bad to see cocoa butter languishing distantly behind the usual villains of sugar and glucose syrup ie double sugar condensed milk and vegetable oil  the chocolate itself is said to contain at least  cocoa solids and was quite acceptable in this whether its edible on its own remains to be seenfat wise these little fun sized fellas still pack a punch  six grams in each with  grams of those being saturated fat  that means if they ever put out a full sized bar at say  grams it would be packing roughly half your daily fat allowance of  grams and half your saturated fat content if cholesterol is a problem  best stick with a mere single fun sized one thenwoolworthssafeway go figure i walk down the block to buy my food at safeway here in virginia holy multinationals batmanperry i think woolworths safeway etc are really just brands that get soldlicensed to different companies around the world here in the uk we used to have both but no longer have either of themwhat did it taste like lolperry woolworths and safeway are the exact same company here in australia  in fact its only here in victoria that theyre known as safeway but theyre starting to brand themselves as woolworths to catch up with the rest of the countryjames it tasted exactly like a snickers which is a bar i happen to like very much indeed   i just think a direct copy is a little bit cheeky of them  surely there are other combinations to try under your own brand name
slab time againas per usual with hotel chocolat slabs i knew g was going to be way too much for me so after taking these photos this particular slab came with me to be shared out at a bank holiday barbecueit is not a toy and should not be treated as suchfor a simple fruit and nut slab the design is quite spectacular closeup small pieces of brightly coloured fruit and nuts peak enticingly through the milk chocolate i imagine this is done simply by sprinkling the fruit and nuts into a mould before pouring the chocolate on top such a simple thing but to be able to see the actual fruit makes a huge difference so much nicer than burying it deep inside the chocolateand of course it tastes as good as it looks im not a huge fan of fruit  nut im more fruity than nutty but my friends at the barbecue clearly were sat round the table chatting in the sunshine the pack got passed around small chunks got broken off and the bulk of it soon disappearedi think most people were more impressed by the size and presentation of the slab than the product itself after the initial wow factor it was devoured with little comment but there was certainly no negative feedback from anyone the chocolate was smooth and delicious the nuts were suitably crunchy and the fruit suitably fruityinterestingly hotel chocolat also do a  dark chocolate version of this particular slab the purists might prefer that but im quite sure the riffraff i hang out with at barbecues will be quite happy sticking with the milk chocolate versioni think the riff raff were quiet because they were enjoying it so much i looks fantastic the dark version must be exceptionalwhat a great idea of the packagingstill what kind of fruit was in there
i was unchained today and allowed into the supermarket so i came home with chocolatey goodies as one doesi also noticed that the standard tim tam comes in a g pack  these novelty versions are the same price  but you only get g in a pack  a cunning plan indeed when you can supply  less product and charge the same pricecome pm it was time  time for the testthe classic tim tam has been around forever and aussies are renowned for scoffing them in vast quantities and drinking tea through them oldest son is capable of drinking a glass of milk through one something which i believe requires considerable effort how would this comparethe smell on opening the pack  is rich and sweet mainly sweet the chocolate is not especially dark and its pretty soft lots of milk in this one i busted one open  a real tim tam has two biscuity layers and some sweet chocolateymousseystuff in between with a slathering of chocolate all over the outside this crush thing has only a single biscuity layer and quite a lot of the soft chocolateymousseystuff with a few chunks of something yellow shoved in here and thereeldest son bit the ends off took one look and said its not a real tim tam that about sums it up needs two layersand it tastes sweet it is very sweet and there is no way you could drink your tea through one of these as a sort of a version of the real thing its actually not bad better than i expected the first was not really enough to do a decent taste test a second was required to confirm the impression a third was not possible  too sweetthis is the only special version of tim tam that ive tried and i quite liked it i agree that its very sweet but also quite moreishah theres a couple of other flavours that i liked  in spite of myself but ashleigh surely the double coat was just as good as tim tam darki have to disagree that they are too sweet think i ate nearly the whole pack in one sitting ha ha ok had help from a kid too i have so far enjoyed all the flavour of tim tams nothing can ever beat an original but there is also nothing wrong with adding other flavours into the tim tam familyyour article was excnelelt and erudite
rather than hand made and slightly exotic in some cases chocolates burnt sugar sell funky little boxes of their sweets something which has enabled them to get good distribution deals these should be available in department stores and possibly supermarkets quite soonthe packaging markets these fairly and squarely at women best enjoyed with  a red velvet chaise longue and a foot rub isnt terribly macho after all is itthat in itself presents something of a conundrum some of these caramel chunks are big no bigger than that a proper chunky mouthful keep these in the fridge and pop a big chunk and youre likely to be rendered speechless for quite a while insert your own tacky speechless women gag here should you feel the need aiming them at female consumers and then making then the size of small house bricks i exaggerate a tad i confess seems a little strange to me after all its not terribly ladylike to be seen with your cheeks bulging in an alarming geometric fashion or is it there again what do i knowthe chocolate coating is a good dark  cocoa blend with a good texture and a very pleasing cocoa sharpness which precedes the caramel sweetness in good style the caramels themselves are indeed gooey warm summer afternoons are not good reviewing times rich creamy and very satisfying should you require that particular comfortas chocolate coated caramels go these tick all the boxes not too posh to make them unaffordable not in any way weird wacky unusual or challenging a good quality version of a perennial favourite and as such worthy of attention from those who enjoy such things in other words if you like chocolate coated caramels youll love theseim still laughing at you being speechless after eating a chunky piece straight out of the fridge lovely imagery simon
so how does it taste well if youve ever eaten a christmas tree youll know exactly what its like you havent well id better describe it thenthe mastic aroma is noticeable from the moment you open the wrapper and thats just intensified as soon as you put a small chunk on your tongueit tastes like pine needles or how i imagine they would taste mixed with aniseed and eucalyptus its spicy fragrant and  once you get used it  really quite delicious its one of those flavours that hangs around in your mouth for an hour after the chocolate has melted but all it does is remind you that you want another chunkthis is definitely worth picking up if you happen to spot a bar in the wildthat sounds incredible  ive never eaten tree flavoured chocolate beforethat does sound rather interesting my mums off to greece tomorrow  maybe i should request somehttpwwwmastihashopnycomdefaultphppnameitemviewprodidcatidlahere is another alternative for chocolate with mastiha mastihashopny also has milk chocolate bars and chocolate bites with mastiha
back to the golden block in my hot little hands  whittakers dark chocolate tends to be a bit on the gritty side but their milk chocolate delivers a much softer and creamier mouth feel  trying some of it filled with runny caramel on a rainy night in was an exciting prospectas you can see whittakers blocks consist of solid chunky rectangles that would definitely pack a painful punch if used to wallop someone what a waste of good chocolate that would be and promise a satisfying feed rather than a gourmet tastebefore biting into it i erroneously read the back ingredients panel and found to my dismay that the caramel has  amongst the expected stuff like glucose condensed milk flavour and syrup  the rather unappetising confectionery fat  another question what kind of fat is confectionery fat  is it called something else on other labels to make it sound betterthese niggling queries were soon thrust aside when i tasted the flowingly sweet and distinctly honeytinged caramel  deeee licious  love chunks is a caramello king from way back and reckons that cadbury still edges out whittakers but im not so sure if thats just loyalty or a superior palate because id certainly struggle to able to tell them apart if blindfolded   whittakers creamy milk caramel packs a very flavoursome and sugary kick that needs to be eaten with a drink of coffee tea water or milk to rest the tastebuds and allow you to reach for moreit also eats very well as in like a quaffing wine  it goes down far too quickly and a  gram block disappeared in one evening between two consenting adults  oooopsi had a bad experience with caramello when aged about  or  or something like that as in ate a large block in an evening and spent the next  hours throwing it all back up again i havent been able to touch its since and that was about  years agoyoure on your own in this oneits probably important to note that the review links to the us caramello made by hershey and thats probably very different from the australian one  which i believe is more like our dairy milk with caramel but still different sounds like ill have to look out for this oneyoure right dom  aussie caramello is made from cadbury dairy milk and whittakers is a very very close copywhittakers have now released a dark chocolate version of this in nz and i hope the aussies get a chance to try it i had to get a a block sent to me a kiwi in london when i heard about it for anyone who has ever dreamed of a dark caramello or uk dm  caramel it really is something else great with black coffee milky drinks chilled or naturally on its own im surprised the combo has never caught on much before as dark chocolate hard caramels are commonplace and generally a disappointment i usually feel ive been conned with a thin coating of chocolate into eating a toffee whittakers liquid caramel in dark chocolate is a kind of luxury version of this theyve liquified the centre for you so that the bitter chocolate and sweet caramel get to meet and the payoff is very good the only other examples of this i know of is in the caramel in cadbury old goldcontinental chocolates box ausnz and a memory that trebor in the uk did something like this in the pick and mix range and long ago in chocolate logs
the caoba bar named for a tree that shades cacao plants is the only milk chocolate in the range there are also four darks and one white its still pretty high up at  which can make for a lovely chocolate but this ones different somehow the ten squares neatly stamped with the el rey logo smell rather like a hersheys bar um it probably tastes something like hersheys too    all grown up it has that strong milky caramel sweetness but embracing chocolate instead of grease i wonder if hersheys would taste like this if its production got more attention theres also the same innocent marshmallow flavor note in there as in amanos montanya bar also made from venezuelan beans the mouthfeel is nice with all the softness of a milk chocolate but a slower melting that seems to be the biggest influence of its higher percentage i might not have guessed it to have reached  contentits a nice bar above the average even if i wouldnt call it king of all chocolates still some sort of royalty maybe it makes a good option when you just want a sweet straightforward milk chocolate but still dont feel like going onto the candy bar leveldoes anyone know whether el rey chocolate is obtainable in australia eighteen months ago in caracas i became very attatched to the gran saman blocks now i am back in melbourne and completely unable to find themthe url is chocolateratingswordpresscomyes  you  can  buy  in  australia  i  contacted  elreycom  and  they  have  just  sent  a  big  order  to  arrive  in  dec  the  company  name  was  christos  but  i  am  still  waiting  for  a contact  number
it has very light almost fruitlike top notes with an underlying rich full cocoa flavour it isnt the most complex of chocolates but what it does have is a full rich cocoa flavour with creamy mid tones and a berrylike top note with a very pleasing soft mouthfeel the finish is clean and i could cheerfully have  continued tasting until the whole bar was donevalrhona seem to be raising their profile here in the uk and with little special offerings like this they would definitely have mine  provided they dont charge silly moneylooks like good chocolate  have to look for it here in the usrichyou may have heard that valrhona discontinued palmira just over a year ago i have one kilo of  palmira plantation  remaining in my cool room which will become bonbons sometime this spring beautiful chocolateill miss it
the box is packed with an assortment of milk chocolate truffles and micro slabs at least thats what i call them of solid milk chocolate of different varietiesthere are two of each chocolate so this is perfect for sharing and perfect for greedy chocolate reviewers like meso lets see what we have herethe slabsthe trufflesso there you have it this is a quality box of chocolates but to get the most out of it youre going to need two things  a very sweet tooth and a friend to share them with if you have both those its worth giving a go but they are very rich and theres a lot of large chocolates here  if like me you try eating them alone youll almost certainly end up in milk oblivionyuuuuuuum oh to be a chocolate reviewer how can you hate the honey milk chocolate and love the caramel milk chocolate thats just weirdbecause honey is disgusting and caramel is yummyi dont really like their honey choc either however there are fans out there  my partner loves it to bits i really liked the gianduja crest and i found the macadamia bite delicious  maybe because im nuts for nutsi love the cinnamon crunch chocolates  hotel chocolate make them in milk and white varieties but i love to see a dark chocolate versioncan i be a review too can i can i i wanna try these so bad in the meantime i tried their exuberantly fruity box and it was a charmyum any of you care to review itcan you be a review you want us to review youif you can package yourself up neatly in a cardboard box and post yourself to london i would be happy to review you yesoh thats not what you meant  i saw that too late after id posted it ill try to package myself see what you come up with when i knock on your door 
their very informative website has as an englishlanguage film clip that states that germans are second only to the swiss for sheer volume of chocolate eaten averaging  kilograms a year  vivani are justifiably proud that their products are made from organic ingredients and they pay local growers a fair price for their cocoa beans  this second fact might go down a bit better if there was the official fair trade logo on their producthowever the means used to get their hands on them vivani manufacture their chocolate straight from the cocoa bean most from ghana i think and use more cocoa butter so that they dont have to include lecithin  a thickener that is often geneticallymodified and most certainly not organic neither wrapper has anything in english so im assuming that vollmich schokolade mit knackerbrot und zimt is something to with little caramel crisps in the crisper bar and mit knuspriger espressocremefullung is chocolate biscuit cream  there isnt any nutritional information on the wrapper either so im content to remain ignorant about fat and sugar content especially seeing as i ate both bars in one sittingwhatever the translation they are both rather scrummy  the milk chocolate has  cocoa solids and is a lovely europeanstyle creamy version that was all too quickly eaten and enjoyed with my second cup of coffee for the morningto be honest the flavours for each bar arent vastly different just pleasantly sweet and crunchy with a toffeeedge to the crisper but with bits in it barely visible to the naked eye  there was a noticeably more creamy filling for the espresso but only the faintest hint of coffee  if blindfolded id struggle to identify the differenceswhilst theyre nothing earthshattering they hold their own alongside the bigger more mainstream chocolate bars but ill certainly keep my eyes open for vivanis more gourmetsounding blocksid love to see us chocabloggers surveyed as wed be way waaaay over that amounthi kathah thanks mariangelaive seen these at a local cheese and wine store but the one i picked up was the g bar of dark chocolate with caramel crisp it was absolutely amazing the closest to it i can think of is the lindt excellence caramel as they are both thin bars with little caramel bits but this one was a deliciously rich dark chocolate that balanced the sweetness of the caramel really recommend it if you see it kath  sadly the one i bought was the last at the storerats on your recommendation alone hannah ill keep on looking
im a little confused why this bar doesnt appear to be fair trade or completely organic when theo markets itself for being fair trade and all the  chocolates were anyway this venezuelan cocoa bar is the darkest in theos origin collection at  im no strange to upper ranges but the only  ive had was by e guittard others have stuck to the s or gone closer or up to  this bar is bigger than the s at  grams instead of  broken into six of the large rectangles this time it isnt quite so mirrorshiny but still healthylookingtheo says it offers  cacao content without any of the bitterness typically associated with such a high percentage dark chocolate ive formed my own opinion on that statement the initial hit is dusty earthy and yes kind of bitter though in a flavorful way about halfway through cocoa flavors come into domination like a rich rich chocolate dessert theres a bit of spice in the aftertaste the mouthfeels  just a bit stickier not so smooth and clean than i like but it worksthis is one your mouth needs tempering for only then is the nobitterness quote true i enjoyed the second piece much more tasting only thick chocolate by the third or fourth piece i even started reacting to it as to sweetness enjoying the delicious moment the flavor becomes so much a part of your mouth that cutting it off prematurely would hurt as much as cutting off your hand i think im in love with a chocolate again and theo passes the test againi love theo chocolate  i went on a tour of their factory in seattle last weekend  i have to admit however any chocolate over  is too bitter for me  ill have to try this one someday
for raw chocolate this bar is very zingy the underlying cocoa flavours are topped by a very bright tingling citrus note from the berries the finish is definitely more cocoa than fruit with the blueberry and acai providing a palatecleansing climax to a soft rich mouthfuli liked this enough to be interested in trying some more next time i pass a health food shop i shall be keeping an eye out for more mood foods bars particularly the banana and hemp seed onecomments are closed
according to the  pages of pr bumf that came with these six chocolates ooh la la chocolaterie was founded in  by professional chocolatier antonia corpwhich is nice but unfortunately after having spent several hours reading through reams of marketing nonsense i discovered that they had neglected to tell me what the chocolates they had sent me actually are sure theyre pretty but thats not really enough to base a review onfortunately after several weeks negotiations with the pr company  email exchanges several high level meetings and a top secret prisoner exchange i managed to get the details out of them so what we have here is which apparently is part of the christmas collection quite why ms corp is promoting fresh handmade christmas chocolates in august i dont dont know i can only assume that its another part of the pr blitz  trying to get us bloggers to write about them in plenty of timethankfully the chocolates themselves are all pretty good  at  for a box of six chocolates they need to be the flavours all work together quite nicely but there isnt really anything hugely exciting theres a little bit of spice but nothing too strong the spiced chai and ginger chocs would have to be my favourites here with the sherry and raisin coming bottom  the flavours immediately brought back memories of cheap s chocolate liqueurs  not really my thingi did have a slight issue with the textures of the fillings they are smooth but just too thick to be luxurious if im paying nearly  per chocolate i really want a softer silkier texture than anything in this selection providesat the end of the day this is an interesting little box of chocolates the flavours are pleasing but the texture and finish isnt up to the level it needs to be at this price pointi hope  was an exaggeration  pistachio is underutilized in chocolate here in the us  too bad to since it has such a distinct and wonderful flavorive tried them and thought they were absolutely fantastic perhaps shes taken your views on board and improved them
first off the starters blocks is the whittakers  weighing in at a meaty  grams it packs a not too shabby  cocoa solids  it has a fine aroma that wafts up invitingly when the foil is opened and the ginger is spread throughout the block in small crystallised chunks  the overall taste is very nice and satisfying interestingly despite ginger comprising  of the total block and being made from in order of volume sugar ginger and icing sugar the result is sweet but not too sweet  maybe the spicy bit in it is what moves it from being potentially far too sickly into highly enjoyableingredientswise theres nothing too unusual there and the fat thunders in at g per g  not surprisingly the sugars make up g per  grams  good thing i didnt inhale the entire  grams in one sittinglindt prefer to keep their excellence blocks to a sleek  grams which i suspect are designed by evil and thin marketers to leave us punters wanting more of it  like the whittakers block it is also packing  cocoa solids  this is a relief to me on both counts because i think that  chocolate would not highlight the sweet pepperiness of the gingerunlike the whittakers there arent any chunks of crystallised ginger or even the powdered stuff  the ingredients panel describes it as natural flavour from ginger and no i dont know what that means either  the lindt squares are much flatter and smoother than the grainier whittakers and the taste is truly delectable  the absence of chunky bits means that the flavours effortlessly dissolve with the chocolate revealing a peppery fruitiness as well as a distinct spectrum of fresh ginger and spices  the extra smooth factor is revealed in that it slaps you with  grams of fat per  grams but slightly less sugar than the whittakers at  grams per  gramslindt again show how to tackle a traditional dark chocolate partner in a different way that still celebrates the union but elevates it to something better still  in terms of quality and flavour it easily beats whittakersthats not to say that whittakers isnt good because it is  both will remain regular fixtures in my chocopantry  whittakers for value but lindt for qualityi have to agree here ive tried both of these and i like them both if you hadnt already gathered im a ginger nut in the land of oz thats a biscuit aka cookie so this is a really bad jokethe lumps of ginger in the whittakers are really nice and let you know you have the real deal the flavour aint bad eitherthe lindt is a really nice chocolate which i was determined to hate because it lacked the lumpy bits i couldnt do it its good really nice of course it it had lumpy bits it would be betterhmmmm i just cant imagine ginger chocolate without the lumpy bits but if two chocabloggers agree then it must be ok another one to add to my must try at some point list this list is getting longlindt never disappoints and i am definitely going to keep my eye our for this oneits worth finding the lindt just because it doesnt have the lumpy bits ie its different  and delicious
the name in particular is something i find appealing perhaps its the inner geek struggling through but the idea of a big bar of chocolate wafer being called bartek is somehow appealing either that or its the name of a course at the local adult education college about the properties of reinforcing bars in concrete constructionwhatever the name might imply the contents are pretty good we have a decent wafer of about  layers the whole thing is roughly  cm x  cm  so a decent size it has a nice coating of chocolate over and the layers are glued together with a very pleasant slightly sweet chocolatey cream on mine the chocolate coating had been knocked off in one or two places so presentation was not quite as good as it could be but for a cheap snack who caresperhaps the only disappointment is that on biting in the wafer is not as crisp as i think it should be however the overall package of the wafer the filling the coating and the generous size means that on  out of  points everything is done right on one point its not quite where it should bethe other important thing to note about these is that they might seem generously sized that does not mean they are suitable for sharingill keep on the quest for the perfect chocolate wafer right now though this one has to get the top rankingif u are looking for a chocolate wafer that is not coated in chocolate you can try to get your hands on the wafers from loacker you can get them from malaysia and singapore not sure if they have them in the uk or australia they come in bitesized bits in a resealable bag absolutely addictive dhibartek is diminutive of bartholomewhave you tried oreo wafer sticks theyre not too bad for a quick snack and best of all portion control you can get them in the biscit section at coles and they have chocolate chocolate mint  white chocolatei like the name bartek he sounds like a bloke who wouldnt mind if you threw up in his car the kind of guy who can tap a keg and catch the cricket ball when its hit for six into the crowdthe sort of bloke who would catch the cricket ball in his teeth im a serialcommenter its probably because i have an opinion on everything ani love the bartek bar it is the best yeah sebras got right  grzeski are yummy 
yet despite suffering a case of organic overload these biscuits caught my eye in tesco inside the g box there are eight biscuits half dipped in  milk chocolatenow im not much of a biscuitcookie person so its been quite a while since ive had anything like this but in terms of both taste and texture these reminded me of a chocolate hobnob biscuitthere really arent that many sultanas per biscuit here  maybe one or two per biscuit so i dont think they add much more than a slight chewiness to an otherwise very crunchy biscuit the cinnamon flavour is quite subtle too only really coming through when the biscuit has gone  and annoyingly forcing you to have just one more every timethere really isnt a lot of chocolate either and thats unfortunate because its rather nice but its also so thin that it tends to melt all over your fingers before you have a chance to stuff it into your mouththe net result of all this addictive cinnamoniness and melting chocolatiness is that the only way to eat these is quickly this box disappeared in around  secondsin summary  i wish these had thicker chocolate and there were more of them but theyre still a deliciously yummy way to spend  secondsnever been quite a fan of green  blacks chocolate though i have to admit that these chocolate biscuits look quite decenti hope we get these in australia at some point they sound pretty tasty to me
why nestl didnt register names such as the obvious bubbly to protect their product is beyond me but its taken cadbury many years to either develop a good enough rival or to somehow circumvent intellectual chocoproperty rules in order to finally release their own versionas you can see its the faithful glassandahalf of full cream dairy milk chocolate with a nonthreatening  cocoa solids  theyve divided theirs into a mere five segments instead of aeros mystical number seven and at  grams theyre being sold at the same price as their other  to  gram bars  sighcasting my qualms about being unfaithful to aero aside it was time to try the imposter  bugger  its very nice  slightly sweeter chocolate than the nestl version perhaps but theyve got the famous mini bubbles and fine texture inside just right  i would struggle to tell the difference in a blindfold test for either the original or the mint varieties  five segments are frustratingly too few  why didnt they go one better than nestl and put eight bad boys inside insteadkudos to cadburys i guess but unless its on special ill stick with aero  the original  that is unless cadbury can come up with different flavours worth tryingbut more importantly i want to know which is best bubblewispa or aeroi say wispa i wish we had wispa in australia  i remember loving it when i tried it many times when i lived in london way back in i saw those cadbury aero things in woolies yesterday but today they were gone  both boxes from the shelves either everybody wanted to try one or aero is now kicking up a fussim liking these cadbury barsi hate mint chocolate i could only bear to eat tim tams mint biscuits so when i bought the cadbury bubbly in mint for my bestie and i was forced to take a bite of it i was pleasantly surprised now im hooked onto it damn i like cadbury bubbly but i dont think it holds a bar up to aeroaero bubbles are i think lighter and the block softer so crumbles nicer and the chocolate is thinneri like to nibble the chocolate off then eat only the bubbles and you cant really do that with the cadbury versionits a good second ill buy it when its on sale and cheaper but otherwise im an aero galim with zoe  cadbury bubbly is nice but there is something about aero that make it my number one choice  theres just something about aero maybe a higher fat content that makes it melt so beautifully in your mouththis bar is closer to the original  chocolite they all copied themchocolit is the ultimate   was the ultimateaero is sick but not as good as cadburys all off cadburys sales are good inclyding twirl safe bruv innit lol but the only choc i hate is turkish delight that is bear nasty othewise choclate like galaxy and cadburys are ace  do u agreeperhaps blueberries could find their way into cadburys bubbles soon i remember a cadbury bar in the s with orange and lemon pieces in it was this an experiment with friut  i have havent seen any more since i recall at that time my mother had been to visit the cadbury factory in bournville and was given this bar as a taster with lots of other choc goodies we thought we were in heaveni tried it in ramadan and it was amazing   im not a big fan of mamlsralhow but i loved it  alah yewafghoom  also my mom wonder never accept eating choco or marshmellow with the arabic coffee bs when i bought it to her she fall in love with it   alah yewafghoom ya rab
a box with chocolate inside is a wonderful thing to find at your door when you get up in the morning even if its already expected in my excitement i had to get the photo shoot done and try some before anything else it seemed like a sign that the chocolate was for breakfast but who wants a review taken on an empty stomach so it sat there taunting me all morning while i found other things that needed to be done firsti cant stop eating it where is my selfcontrol suffice it to say that my lindt prejudice is overglad to hear it deannaactually i just assumed that this classic block had already been reviewed its always been a favourite so im not surprised you had it for breakfastyum i love the raisin nuts and chocolate mix
the chocolate sticks themselves have some unusual flavours theres a saffron stick a cardamom stick one flavoured with yuzu a japanese citrus fruit with a grapefruit tang  ginger vanilla and coconut and finally strawberry and balsamic vinegar a fairly eclectic mix in their own right but then there are the inksthe three tiny pots are home to another set of intriguing flavours kalamansi juice a lemon like fruit sweet orange and cocoa nib  and matcha japanese green tea and poppy seedheres a video of m galler himself talking the viewer through the concept and contents of the boxit only seemed right and proper to share this rather splendid looking box of chocolates so i enlisted the services of a lovely japanese lady selected for her ability to authenticate the matcha and yuzu flavours after exhaustive testing we concluded that not only the oriental elements authentic but that the whole thing is an absolute marvelthe flavours used to fill the sticks are subtle yet strong and at times utterly sublime from the  musky tang of saffron to the citrus zing of the yuzu by way of a laughterinducing cardamom stick which concealed its flavour in popping candy this is a box of delights for the adventurous palate highlights included the vanilla and coconut stick which was so milky smooth it almost tasted like milky bar chocolate and the amazing strawberry and balsamic sticknaturally all of the flavours go extremely well with the inks and theres a lot of fun to be had offering a new combination to your cotaster it can become almost like a game selecting flavours for someone else to try and seeing their reaction i was reminded of doms review of the hotel chocolat set that came with a blindfold well to my mind this would be much better suited to a game of blind tasting by candlelightwhether youre planning a quiet night in for two or looking for a memorable climax to a dinner party i cannot recommend this box highly enough it could be a sophisticated treat to be enjoyed with a coffee or the source of sensual entertainment for lovers and  i loved every minute of it and not just because of the company its not cheap of course but if you were looking to impress then this will do the job admirably just buy one nowa coworker who was a vegan at the time got this as a gift from one of our clients from germany she couldnt eat it so naturally gave it to me unfortunately it had melted  resolidified a bit but it was quite an experiencethe following year a good friend visited europe and brought back a huge  ounce box of galler chocolates and i realized how awesome this must have beenreally inventive box of chocolates
the soft coeur is advertised as a massage bar for couples its made with honey and cocoa powder making a chocolate honey centre which you can apparently smooth over the other person or yourself if so inclined they say the experience is quite sticky though i personally didnt find it that much different from some of their other massage barssoft coeur smells very sweet  a candy smell rather than chocolate smell its quite a rich bar and like all massage bars needs some warming up before you can see what it doesapparently youre meant to break it in half and use the brown chocolatey centre for the massage as well as the white cocoa butter bit i must admit i found that quite weird to work with it smears brown on the skin and your hands in a manner which i didnt find entirely appealing although it is perfectly edible and smells lovelysupposedly that is actually the point of the bar and its meant to be similar to the experience of using actual chocolate or honey on the skin i guess if youre into that youll find it quite fun and significantly less messy than the alternativethe cupcake was a bit more problematic for me to test as its for oily andor teenage skin whereas i have sensitive skin i did however find a friend with the right skin type who also happened to be a fan of everything chocolatehere is what she had to say about the experiencethe mask smells amazing the minute you open the jar once youve worked out that its a screwtop and doesnt just pull off its like lovely thick minty chocolatey gooey mud which is quite cool on your skin and feels as if it may contain menthol it doesnt though it does contain both peppermint and spearmint oilit was very tricky to wash off  i had to sort of scrape it off it made my face feel really nice and the pores almost invisible so it obviously works my face tingled for a while afterwards  probably from the peppermint oil  so this mask would probably be a bit much for sensitive skin typescomments are closed
somewhat annoying the wrapper doesnt give the percentage of cocoa solids in the chocolate but it does give the percentage of milk solids  and the percentage of cookie pieces in the bar as a whole  in this day and age manufacturers really should be giving us these numbers so we can make informed buying decisions before cramming it into our faces without reading the label anyway of coursethe front of this bar is divided into these rather sexy curvy chunks with a single letter g embossed upon them this is obviously designed to further enhance the sexy indulgent image that mars like to promote galaxy with and i think it does the job quite wellthe top of the bar may be smooth and shiny but the underside is studded with the outline of lots of small pieces of cookie as you can seethe problem is that the crunchy texture invites you to bite but the pieces are too small and you end up almost having to chew it but chewing isnt exactly the most indulgent way to consume a creamy milk chocolate you could wait for it to melt but then youre just left with a mouth full of small biscuity rocksand that cookie doesnt add much in the way of flavour either the galaxy chocolate completely overwhelms any flavour that may be there but having said all that this is still quite a moreish bar  providing you can get through it all without doing yourself an injury if only those cookie pieces were a little big larger or softer i could easily see myself picking one up againfrom what ive heard this particular variety of galaxy is only available in tesco so id be interested to hear if youve found it elsewhere i have managed to find this at my local co op as part of a  for a pound promotionmy local spar sells itthey sell small bars in the newsagent next to my work  i have to agree with your comments although i didnt get any painful bits the cookie is more of an annoyance than adding anything special to the bar i love galaxy fruit and nut thoughthis bar is available everywherewell there you have it i guess its not just tesco then it was just in tesco but it was so popular they decided to sell it everywhereas usual galaxy wins head over heels against the cadburys similar version with biscuit incallum my local iceland store sells boxes of  milky way crispy rolls for i personally thought it was delicious i mean if you let it melt in your mouth or just chew it its lovely all the samehas any one made a cheese cake useing galaxy cookie crumble wife saw one but we have not used galaxy cookie crumble or even seen itcocoa solids  minimumwe had the cheese cake at work a colleague made it and it was so moreish  have got the recipe and will make it just as soon as i can find the chocolate i live in the middle east and supplies of things like this are few and far betweenhiive bought it in my local sainsburys and the corner shop  love iti think the cookie goes well with the bar and adds a bit more excitment
the thing i enjoy about being a chocolate reviewer is that even though i have to run and power walk as often as possible so that i dont resemble a human lindor ball it does make me feel as though i can treat myself after a particularly punishing runbear in mind that id been for a run earlier that morning and had not eaten any breakfast before rushing out to do the grocery shopping the banking and search out some obscure hardware parts needed for love chunks handyman tasksthus my eyes were fixated on the tapas tasting plate  it didnt say for two people it just had things in divisions of two so i assumed it would do the trick in providing a midday meal for a hungry chocabloggerwhen it arrived it left me momentarily  and quite uncharacteristically  speechless  oh my cocoa loca lordy looin addition to my chai latte yes i was feeling a bit poncy that afternoon we havedark chocolate chocovic icecreamtwo triangles of densely moist and muddy browniesnaturally the melted chocolate and icecream selections also include dark and white chocolate and there are six other divine hand made chocolates to choose from as welli ate the icecream first and it was as rich and mousselike as id hoped  the churros were crisp on the outside and softly cakeish in the middle and tasted superb on their own  when dipped into the chocolate they were even better  the catanies are already a personal favourite of mine and were thoroughly enjoyed as were the brownieseverything was top notch quality and wickedly delicious  and yes i ate everything except six catanies that the waitress put into a cute little cardboard box for me to take homeand yes i felt utterly full and sick afterwards and didnt need any dinner that night  but it was worth itand the napkins motto really speaks to me  better to have enjoyed it and made a mess than never to have enjoyed at all  absolutelyohh that sounds yummy  hey how far is that from the melbourne airport she asked only half jokingthat looks absolutely delicious thank you this has givin me some ideas for my next chocolate dessertchocolate tapaswhat a fantastic idea  its a guaranteed sugar high  thanks for posting itkathy theres a few in melbourne now  highpoint fitzroy acland st kilda knox qv in the city worth a taxi ride surelyhealthychocolate youre welcome  just make sure you invite me and have a treadmill nearby to use afterwardsno worries  fudge addict  the catanies themselves are worth the trip and therell be separate review on them soonthat looks so fantastic must try this soonomg this is wonderful just reading it makes me drool over my keyboard thanks kath fantastic review and delicious subjectchocolate tapas what a concept what would you pair that with 
another visit to my local butcher means its time for more strange foreign imported chocolatey goodness or so i thoughttodays pick of the crop is original biscuit ressana raspberry which the box proudly proclaims to be a biscuit with fruit rapsberry jelly a promising start just ignore the carefully whitedout price label that i could not removethere was a very strong berry smell when i opened the pack that must have been it for the berries though i think they escaped at that point in terms of presentation we have a small biscuit with a splodge of sweet stuff on top and a thin smear of chocolate from one biscuit to another the splodges are in different places  some in the centre some way offset to the side the box picture and the reality are not quite in alignment according to the label the berry jelly comprises  of the product and the chocolate is  further the chocolate is supposed to be  cocoa solidsthe splodge of sweet stuff is not the nice red berry colour shown on the box its more of a pale pinkbrown its also quite a thick jelly so it has a texture closer to rubber and the only real flavour is sugar similarly the chocolate is just nothingy ive tried in the name of science eating a few of these upside down so the chocolate hits the tongue first this makes a marginal improvement with a hint of cocoa and berry flavour coming through you have to search hard for it though i dont know how they do it but there are not many things where the chocolate is there in name but not flavourand finally the biscuit has a curious texture not crisp not soggy either but somewhere in between it sort of melts awaydont get me wrong  these are perfectly edible but im sorry to say they just dont float my boati think you were expecting a little too much from a macedonian imitation of the legendary jaffa cakei was just going to say that these look like mutant jaffa cakesfirst thing that came to mind was  theyre jaffa cakesthe real ones remind me of the black rubber bath plugs and maybe they tasted about the same too
back when just a few years ago i found most plain dark chocolates a little boring a bag of individual squares became my friend i discovered how easy it was to bring a square with me during the day to savor slowly at some pointreturning to it now i find the aroma underneath the light gold foil reminds me of chocolate chips i guess ive habitually been using ghirardelli chocolate chips long enough now that it was bound to happen ghirardelli manages a unique flavor in their dark chocolate this one is described as highly aromatic with mocha blackberry and dark cherry notes throughout the sweetness and bitterness of this bar hold hands like a cat and a dog they shouldnt get along so well but since they do anyway they end up so similar as to be nearly indistinguishable the delicate smoothness gives a gentle touch with a thick though pleasant aftertaste left after it melts id forgotten how nice it islooking at the name i can see how it fits though its four in the afternoon right now and twilight is still a ways away the soft colors of the fading light the scorching of the sun taken away though its heat lingers the comfort of another day at its close even with a touch of restless anticipation for the morrow oh yes and its delightfulsounds like poetry for the palatethe very best kind of poetryghirardelli is an ok product i am just shocked that in their own locations product is extremely expensive vs walmart costco etc we should not contribute to support a bunch of lazy abusive europeans managing this company here in america we have great american chocolate companies ghirardelli is not an american company
nestl have repackaged their club dark chocolate range and some of my favourites sob didnt make the transition  farewell dear mandarin club cappuccino and mild  creamy  it was nice knowing you  but a new player has arrived cashew nut and cherry  will it be able to fill in the large void left by those venerable club stars that went before itfirstly lets talk about the packaging  both nestl and cadbury have switched from plasticpaperfoil wrappers to a thin cardboard box  however unlike cadburys envelope flap at the backwhich can be opened a few rows sneakily snapped off and then put back on the shelf only to be purchased by an innocent unsuspecting shopper ie me  the nestl back flap is less likely to disguise the treachery of tampering handsthis difference may seem minor but its pretty annoying to get home plonk down on the sofa ready for some mainstream chocolatey indulgence to find that some stranger ie not me has touched the chocolate and you have no idea what else theyve done with those hands let alone to the chocolate  erkanyhooo  back to nestl clubs new flavour cashew nut and cherry  when the foil is ripped away a richly sweet berryish aroma does waft gently up into ones eager nostrilsyes its delicious  very much so  smooth creamy even though its a dark chocolate and the lovely chewy cherries and crunchy slivers of cashew are expertly partnered together  the chocolate is a lovely smooth and sweet introduction to dark chocolate and the recipe has recently changed to include butter oil to make the darker chocolate smoother in texture  also its very addictive  their treatwise label on the back suggests a serving of  grams but its too easy to discover that half the block  grams is gone before you realise it  damn their easysnap rows of chocolately heavennutrition panelwise youre looking at  grams of fat per  grams and  grams of sugar per  grams but hey do we really care if were happily enjoying itthe red cherry pieces are nestls usual optimistic description seeing as theyre actually concentrated apple and pear puree with  cherry puree but they do taste nice  theres also a few shreds of dessiccated coconut following closely behind the cashew nut pieces which adds to the interesting texture and perhaps makes the cashew crunch go further  whatever the case its a beautiful blockstill can club cappuccino or mandarin come back toowe munched our way through one of these recently and i have to agree its pretty nicetoo nice  not good for dieters or those wanting to lower their cholesterol because those squares or rectangles really are easy to snap off insert into mouth enjoy reach for another square and its all gone before you know it  sighsounds delicious  where do you find themin every decent aussie supermarket  find some now and youll thank me later i check every week to see if club cappuccino has reappeared  sadly it has been deleted my husband and i had withdrawal symptoms for this delectable coffee chocolate we havent found anything to replace that oh so satisfying melting taste of heaven
you guessed it  its fake twix timehelpfully the tesco web site lists the percentage of chocolate  caramel  and biscuit   figures which are also listed on the wrapper of this bar and im excited to tell you that the ms bar contains a whole  more milk chocolate than a real twix and  less biscuitto be frank id be hard pressed to tell this apart from a real twix i think perhaps the biscuit has a little less flavour but if i was given this sanswrapper and told it was a real twix i probably wouldnt question itbut like the other bars in the range the sole reason for its existence seems to be to fill up shelf space with something that has the marks  spencer logo on it but if im going to ms its unlikely im looking to buy a twix or would even be able to tell thats what this is from a glance at the wrapper and if im specifically looking for a twix im probably not going to go to ms to look for onein fact the only people i can see buying these are chocolate reviewers and people curious about how like a real twix it is like its siblings it turns out that its not bad but now ive established that i have no reason to buy it again and now ive reviewed it you have no reason to buy one at all sorry mssome people do most of their food shopping in ms and so their versions of branded chocolates are useful  or if you are running in to grab a sandwich and want something sweet to go with it then these fit the bill  most of us do not go out to search for a specific chocolate bar  they are an impulse purchase and so ms are right to stock themthe above comment is right i used to shop exclusively in ms and sometimes you just wanted a chocolate bar so that was i a young and constant shopping in ms but for a while now theyve been filling shelf space with branded goods other than their own its blasphemous not only to the regulars but to the workers hopefully a fad which will passif they had to ship in other brands why not something off your blog rather than the big sellers you can get anywhere else why money
the way thorntons are going well soon be spoiled for choice when it comes to good quality milk chocolate both this and the tonka bean are excellent examples of hat can be achieved without pushing the price of the product out of the reach of the average consumer why anyone would ever want to buy a bar of cdm with this sort of chocolate around is beyond meif you havent raided your local thorntons yet and youre partial to some good quality milk chocolate id make a point of visiting them soon your only problem is probably going to be which three to choose for the moneycomments are closed
the biscuit itself is a rather plain affair but maybe that is what is needed against the buttery chocolate because it is very sweet  and moreish  the ingredients panel doesnt state the cocoa content of the chocolate but my guess is that it would be around  and has that classically european cream taste to it  which is a good thing because it makes me sip my tea faster and then have another bite of the biscuitthey look a lot like the le petit ecolier biscuitsyeah theyve been advertising them on tv recently here in the uk toothere is a very similar type of biscuit sold at tesco under their own name and lidl also have a type of these under the brand name of sondey probably one of their own brands the lidl ones have sailing ship on them cant remember what the image on the tesco ones was
once you get inside this bar though there is a difference that will be immediately apparent to hardcore bounty fans rather than the crisp white coconut in a real bounty the filling here is dirty yellowish in colour and a little offputting im not entirely sure how they made coconut go yellow and now that i think about it im not sure i want to know eitherthe taste is a little different too the coconut here is sweet and a little artificial tasting the flavour is more like a liquorice allsort sansliquorice than a bounty its not offensive but one of the main reasons i like genuine bounty on a summers day is because the coconut is refreshing rather than overly sweet  and i just dont get that herethe milk chocolate coating is just average theres not much of it and it tastes pretty much the same as the real thing hopefully if youre buying a copy of a very ordinary chocolate bar youre not expecting to find fabulous chocolate anywayonce again i have to wonder why ms felt the need to produce this in the first place i know they have an aversion to stocking anything but their own brands but this is really taking it a little far ive no objection to every day chocolates either but surely it wouldnt take that much more effort to come up with something originalcomments are closed
the milk chocolate honeycomb was first up as the one i was most curious about turns out its cinder toffee not honeycomb yeah i guess real honeycombs not the best thing to be munching on they couldve added honey in though whatever is or isnt added however i like them the toffee tastes like caramel and cotton candy caressed by a flavorful  milk chocolatethe milk chocolate black currants are a nice change from the usual cherries and cranberries fruity and sweet with only the smallest tartness i wonder how theyd be in a dark chocolatenext up the milk chocolate toffettes are very very small the only comparable thing i can think of is mm minis but these are even smaller dont take their size for granted though as they pack in a lot of sweetness and a slight buttery flavor they also tend to disappearingthe dark chocolate mintettes are natural mint fondant encased in a rich  dark chocolate theyre not too great the mint flavor is boring and bland and the chocolate is too gooeytasting to over please i think i like godivas version of the same format better though its been a whilelastly are the cocoa dusted coffee beans made with costa rican peaberry coffee beans the milk chocolate is a low  but its very think which is good when youre dealing with whole coffee beans i also very much like that its milk chocolate as that helps tone down the overall tastetheyre all nice offerings the mintettes excepted but i found them in a sale pile and the normal price is  thats  for each  gram box thats too much even for a gifti have to agree with whats been said before the quantity is low and the quality isnt high enough to make up for iti saw these at a gourmet shop a few weeks ago and was tempted  mostly because the individual boxes were on sale it was the honeycomb that caught my eye  now i wont botherum they kind of remind me of the kangaroo and wallaby droppings we saw on our last holidaykath thats true but that seems to always be the case with anything chocolatecovered honeycomb is a british name for cinder toffee because of the air bubbles inside it is kind of a confusing name admittedly though i think this company was scottish where its actually known as hokey pokey
newmans were established in  but were acquired by chocolatier firm ernest hillier in   they apparently also have a cherry coconut and plain coconut bar in this treat range so ill keep my beadies open for those in futureback to the nutty caramel  its a fifty gram log thats rather generously covered in milk chocolate that comprises of a minimum of  cocoa solids  it smelled nice and sweet and seemed like just the thing to have with a cup of tea for a midmorning sugarfestthe caramel may look like the inside of a chokito but its not as suck out your mouth and make your fillings shudder shockingly sweet and is also studded with bits of peanut and rice crispies  the inside is described as rice crisps and peanuts floating in caramel which is actually a bit misleading because the caramel is far too thick for anything to float like a feather in it  instead the nuts and crispies are more like forcefully entrapped but thats not necessarily a bad thing in this particular case  newmans nutty caramel treat bar is delicious  sure its no uberposh choc thats handmade by ecuadorian virgins on the south side of the remaining rainforest but its uncomplicated honest sweet easy to munch and satisfying  it vaguely reminds me just a bit of my favourite toast topping which is crunchy peanut butter and honey but with a more burned sugar after taste again this is a good thing  one fifty gram log gives you nearly eleven grams of fat half of which is saturated and  grams of sugar so you know its naughty but also very very niceooooh cherry coconut i want to try one of thosehah  and another devotee of crunchy peanut butter and honey oooooh oh oh im the only one in my house who likes this and i feel left out can i come and live with youi wanna find myself some of these newmans things and try them sounds gooooood
a while back i reported on a journey to our central food market where i picked up a range of goodies this is another from that haul at the time i had no idea what i was buying it looked chocolatey and i havent seen it in a supermarket thats good enough for metoday about am id just come back from a trip to the bank a cup of tea and something nice was called for elevenses those who remember their paddington bear books would of course know what im on about time to open something from the stash and see what its likeeach of these little morsels has a very soft chocolate coating even in a cool room its slightly sticky  tacky to touch which feels a bit unusual and is slightly offputtinginside the layers of gingerbread a fruit jelly and marzipan are quite clearly visible how they are kept separate and how the gingerbread does not go soggy are a bit of a mysteryeating these is a mix of flavours and textures this starts with the chocolate  sweet and not very strong the marzipan is powerful the fruit jelly is sweet and sticky and the gingerbread gives the whole lot a bit of body and a subtle flavour it all certainly delivers a sugar hit im not a huge marzipan fan nor a huge sugar  sweet fan in spite of that i found these to be quite pleasant and ive been delving back into the pack  to confirm my original thoughts purely for scientific purposes of courseif you like your marzipan seek these out theyll put a smile on your faceoooh i love domino stars thank you for reminding my that german supermarkets will traditionally stock up on seasonal candy next week beginning of augustjoy to the worldwe got them around xmas in netto supermarket i adore marzipan and chocolate and gingerbread id never thought of putting them all together thoughi have a sad sad feeling that im going to have trouble finding these christine  i think you are in australia hope i got that right try the german or polish delis in the big groceryfood marketsin melbourne  go hunting at the victoria markets i cant guarantee youll find them there but you never knowin adelaide i found them in the central marketother cities i dont know enough to suggest where you might tryor you could go hunting online ill be hunting at the queen victoria markets in melbourne  i love marzipan and these look rather nice when combined with chocolate jelly and gingerbread
as you can see once you get past the wrapper it looks exactly like a mars bar theres no cocoa percentage listed on the wrapper but i can tell you the top ingredients are sugar glucose syrup sweetened condensed skimmed milk and vegetable oil so you can guess that the actual cocoa content falls somewhere between not much and practically none just like a real mars barits been a long time since i had a mars bar but the taste seems pretty close to the real thing too its very sweet very sticky and after two bites quite sickly in other words it replicates the mars bar experience very wellmy initial impression was that there was less caramel her but having looked back at some of my old mars bar photos they actually look quite similar hardcore experts might be able to tell the difference but i doubt i wouldso for p you have a g bar that looks acts and taste exactly like a mars barmy question is this whyms are known for quality foods theyre a step up from other supermarket chains what on earth are they doing copying something as mundane as a mars bar i dont know if marsmasterfoods were involved in this or licensed the design  i have to assume so because its only mars products that have been faked  or if its an unauthorised copy but thats not really the pointadmittedly i purchased this in the ms simply food in marylebone station where its obviously meant to appeal to passing travelers who want nothing more than a quick snack but i still find it a little mind boggling that they would put their name to this while the rest of the chocolate industry is slowly becoming more aware of quality marks  spencer is putting its good name on what can only be described as junk foodive had one of these i actually prefer real mars bars  a sentence i never thought id writeidk if this is adumb question but why dont you guys like mars barsi like them
considering that these blocks have travelled by shipping container from europe to australia on the high seas been unpacked in a canberra shop purchased and wrapped in an postpak and sent on to melbourne theyve survived remarkably well  hachez cocoa darriba is their range of mild superior dark chocolate that all contain at least  cocoa solids and have a range of flavours  as you can see the chocolate is still glossy remarkable considering the miles its travelled and beautifully dark almost blackthe strawberry  pepper on the left smelled faintly of strawberry when it was unwrapped and snapped cleanly  in the mouth it is the strawberry flavour that emerges first but not overpoweringly so  it then allows the fine dark chocolate to come to the forefront and enables the strong cocoa content to be fully noticed and appreciated  a few moments later a slight peppery tingle makes its presence felt with some crunchy green peppercorn pieces to nibble on after the chocolate has disappeared  these two blocks are really really good  neither are overly sweet and have real ingredients that highlight the quality of the dark chocolate used and the flavours chosen by hachez enhance rather than fight the main ingredient  thanks hannahim so glad they were winners i certainly enjoyed my side of the deal 
some time ago prior to a dose of what may have been swine flu which rendered my palate inactive for over a month the people at organic meltdown sent over a brace of their bars for my attentionthe first bar was a  dark chocolate bar with raspberry and rooibos teaas soon as i popped a piece in my mouth i knew there were raspberries involved the light fruity tang is tempered by the rooibos and assisted by a little orange oil it has a distinct yet subtle citrus zing which weaves its way in and out of  a rich yet light chocolate the cocoa flavours are light and the chocolate is smooth in the mouth with a clean finish which leaves a hint of summer on the tongue i enjoyed the smoothness of the chocolate as well as the flavour raspberry and chocolate are not an uncommon pairing but they arent always done well and this bar delivers good fruit as well as the allimportant chocolatebar number two was a more straightforward  cocoa bar the rich almost earthy aroma hints at the flavours to come like its predecessor this bar is smooth on the palate and it has a very upfront slightly acidic start note which mellows as the piece melts on the tongue once again it leaves the mouth clean and ready for morei found myself liking both of these bars for slightly different reasons the raspberry bar was very much a taste of summer  light and fruity with delicate flavours very much a lazy afternoon chocolatethe dark bar presented good flavours and mouthfeel coupled with a similarly smooth finish its a perfect everyday dark chocolate made all the more attractive by its fair trade organic treesaving credentialsthe main point about these products is of course that they offer the conscientious shopper products that give the producers a fair cut of the proceeds support organic farming and promote conservation fortunately they also taste pretty good as well it would seem that waitrose stock them in the uk along with a handful of health food shops but for more detailed stockist information consult the web sitecomments are closed
my one complaint is over the grains of sugar that disrupt the chocolates smoothness in a few cases it can be a nice aspect but it doesnt belong here still not a huge deal its very enjoyable though being usda organic and fair trade itll set you back around six dollars for  gramswhat is a cacao assi was thinking the same thing  you may want to change it to cocoa mass p ive tried their dark with cocoa nibs and it was wonderful  only problem is it was a gift and i cant find it anywhere for myselfoh dear im a great editor arent i fixed hehe i didnt see the typo but i figure that cacao ass is what you get from eating too much choccie yes but its also known as happy assi thought the grains of sugar made it even betteri have just tried this and generally agree with deanna i dont really like the grains of sugar very muchit is kind of growing on me
rainer reckons that handpoured chocolate might take a while before aussies get into it presumably because it  ahem  might remind them of a cow pat instead  i then pointed out that melbas chocolates which are based in the adelaide hills in south australia actually do make chocolate cow pats that sell like hot cakesas you can see this cow pat is rather pretty actually with a generous handful of cranberries thrown in which makes it seem as though they make up considerably more than the relatively measly eight percent stated on the ingredients panel in my opinionon first taste the milk chocolate is very nice  it is creamily smooth and sweet and eventually i started chewing more intently to release a cranberry or two   erk  the bitter tang of the cranberries rather forcefully cut through the pleasant chocolately start with a jarring discordant note for a few seconds before eventually easing off and blending in a bit better with the chocolate  it was like eating a sour orange  doable but not entirely desirablei like the idea of what theyve done here but im just not sure that the two flavours are a completely successful pairing  this could be a much better match if the cranberries were combined with a dark chocolatehowever the momami website mentions a few other fillings that are also available in their handpoured milk chocolate and they all sound a great deal more appealing  caramelised and roasted hazelnuts roasted salted almonds honey and cornflakes and currants which looking at the photograph more carefully is the automatic translation from german and is likely to be the cranberries ive just tasted  i would be much more keen to try the other flavourshmm are they cranberries or red currantswell it says cranberry on the packet but you poms know your berries a lot better than we aussies or those translating for us do because they do look more like redcurrants dont theyand are redcurrants as tart in taste as these little fellas werepretty confident theyre redcurrants cranberries are bigger than that arent they eep that would be pretty sour but i want to try ityep its on the website the currants are carefully dried so that its original fruity aroma is preservedthe fine aromatic taste of our chocolate cocoa combines with the fruity acidic redcurrants an incomparable taste experienceah there you go  no wonder theyre described as acidic tooisnt a hot cake a polite euphemism for a cow pat anywaywhere can i buy momami chocalat  cafe and hazelnusskrokant
pesek zman was and is a mass market bar the packaging is functional and the logo instantly recognisable to anyone in israel  its indeed the sort of thing you would grab to have as a snack rather than serve your guests after dinner or give as a gift each chocolate finger is branded with the logo though which i thought was quite a nice touch for an otherwise completely blandlooking barthe first thing i noticed when biting into the bar is that its quite crunchy the squares from the original bars have a much softer feel until you get to the wafer itself which i do believe adds to the sensation when eating them and makes them feel more indulgent having a softer bar makes it easier to savour the taste as if youre really taking a time out to enjoy the chocolatethis is still a good treat that can certainly hit the spot with or without a hot drink the bigger size does have an obvious advantage of offering more chocolate though for the true pesek zman experience i would still reach for the original smaller sizecomments are closed
oh woe is me i weakenedi finally broke open this pack that ive been saving since late last year when we brought it back from the far side of the world one of the few remaining chocolates left that we smuggled past border guards through grumpy airport security past customs and sniffer dogs not quite hidden in shoes but the stash was spread amongst several items of luggage  on the grounds that if some were confiscated the rest might not be foundso i approached this one with a  mixture of curiosity and perhaps a little respect result ive been hugely surprised on the upside this is a fantastic creation from lindt the chocolate is a dark  with a rich earthy aroma when you open the pack the liquid filling is not bitter at all but is sweet and carries a hint of cherry the chilli hits a bit later and when it does it brings a gentle lift to the flavour with a tiny bit of zing its baby bears chilli juuuuuuust right through huge selfcontrol ive only eaten two pieces the rest better watch out though their numbers are all nearly upzees cleffer chermans you zee zay haf zees vundervull sssssschocolades zat ze rest of uz juzt dream off zoze nize peepl from lindt zay make all zees type off ssssssschocolates zat uz eeenglish zpeakers are not good enuff to buythe edelbitter range seems to be limited to germany and im rotten with jealousy and rage  whats not to like  with varieties like this one sauerkirchchili  sour cherry  chilli orange zitronebasilikum  lemon  basil and blaubeerlavendel  blueberry  lavender these are some pretty impressive flavour combinations i only managed to bring one home id love to try the rest and to see these sold further afield  like down in the bottom end of the planet where skies are blue it doesnt rain enough and cadbury rules the supermarket roosti love the lindt chili bars and can only believe that the addition of sour cherry would make it fantastic  wish we could get it hereperhapsby golly it does look like much the same thing strangely enough the one you reviewed says chilli on the pack but does not leap out saying cherry how oddseems like lindt are marketing the same or a very similar product under different names in different countriessadly we dont seem to get either of these down under mores the pityi have seen lindt excellence cherry and chili blocks around but not in the past few months so maybe it was a special christmas release or somethingbut lemonbasil and blueberrylavender  wow  please lindt can we have these available in australia  pretty pleaseyoure wrong its also available in spain and its deliciousunfair
the chocolate is dark for only  with a strong chili smell it feels velvety building slowly up to the spice of the chipotle that starts to coat your throat but wheres the lime i cant really taste it but it seems like its essence is in the stinging aftertaste its similar to the addictive feel only youre happy to just stick with the lingering taste instead of quickly having more if you do keep on eating your mouth already seasoned to it then the spice isnt so much of a shocker and you can taste some of the chocolates sweetnessi didnt even know that world market had their own chocolate line i havent been there in months but it seems like i had better go check it outi did a review of the triple berry dark chocolate bar and felt it was delicious you cant buy the organic dark chocolate bars from their website which is really a shame
in case you didnt know tonka bean isnt something that was used to make tough toys for tough kids back in the s it was in fact once used as a cheap substitute for vanilla presumably back when vanilla pods were hard to come byat  this bar is definitely at the top end of the milk chocolate scale but it has surprisingly delicate flavours the cocoa flavours are very light and the tonka bean adds an underlying vanillanut combination with a gentle hint of spice which makes the overall taste extremely moreish its quite sweet in fact its over  sugars but somehow the sweetness doesnt detract from the flavours the lightness of the flavours is reflected in the mouthfeel while its packed full of lovely light cocoa flavour it doesnt cloy the palate at all eating one chunk just leads to another and theres no overload as the mouth is left clean and ready for the next piecei have a sweeter tooth than you but this is definitely my new favourite milk chocolateit sounds utterly divine  dare i say it but ive been craving milk chocolate over dark chocolate lately heresyi did not know that about the tonka bean ill have to check my local import store to see about finding thorntonshi guysi wonder though if the guys at thorntons know about this or they should put it in their label or somethingcoumarin does not thin the blood  it is processed by a major us drug company into a drug with a similar sounding name which is a blood thinner coumarin itself does not  it is a toxic substance used in great quantities just like many other comment household spices   but coumarin as a blood thinner is a myth   also see here for a better explanation httpwwwtheatlanticcomlifearchivethetonkabeananingredientsogoodithastobeillegal
i recently met up with mark attard from san churro wwwsanchurrocom and discussed our mutual admiration for spanish chocolate genius ramon morato hes as nice as he seems theres no act in his friendly public persona why there are other top notch chocolatiers in countries other than belgium and how san churro wants to make great chocolate but without the wank factor that sometimes intimidates people   what impressed me most is that san churro only have eight handmade chocolates available at any given time to celebrate the season and the effort put into sourcing top quality ingredients and creating wonderful flavours  as it is now winter here in australia their latest batch of eight is the el fuego dentro meaning the fire within   they had me at eltime for sampling  the pachamama is a combination of milk chocolate peanut butter and sea salt and is in marks words like a grown up version of peanut butter cups  the salt adds a delicious additional layer of flavour and just made me want to reach for another and another and another  this is definitely the best peanutbutter chocolate ive ever hadthe avellana is a milk chocolate and hazelnut praline with tiny crunchy nougatine pieces sprinked over the top  this is intended for traditional gianduja lovers but has more depth and interest than that  mark says its like a comforting friend in a time of need yes can you guess hes a marketer as well as caf owner but if so this ones a truly top mate thatll not only provide a shoulder to cry on but also give up their bed so you dont have to sleep on the lounge and insist on you having the last of the boutique beers in their fridge superbginger choc man is that revered combination of dark chocolate and ginger but reminds me more of gingerbread than the usual crystallised ginger  it has a slight kick to it which just makes it go down even better with a cup of hot black tea nicely donecaramelo latte  this heavenly blendn of milk chocolate caramel and coffee is a dessert morning tea afternoon tea and late night supper treat all in one  the coffee isnt too strong the caramel isnt too sickly and the milk chocolate sings to them both  beautiful beautiful beautifulthe only white in their current batch the besos del amor is a decadent mix of milk chocolate and baileys covered in white chocolate  the baileys liqueur is easy to spot without being overpowering and the overall sweetly creamy effect is dreamy rather than icky  its a rare day when i can say that this is a white chocolate that id gladly have more ofthe pear perfecta is the closest most dazzlingly delicious pearfilled chocolate ive ever eaten sorry lindt  the confident fruit flavour oozes into your mouth as soon as the soft dark chocolate shell cracks open with a teasing hint of cinnamon creeping in before blending into a chocolately pear dessert in one heavenly mouthful  if only they grew on trees jamaican heat is the ideal way to introduce folk previously afraid of chilli in chocolate towards the warmer side of the spectrum  this is a gianduja milk chocolate and hazelnut blend with some smooth jamaican pepper  youll notice a pleasant tingle but not a mean bite and will want to eat another one  or twothe azteca was left until the end so that my tastebuds wouldnt be too overwhelmed to fully appreciate the other seven  this dark chocolate and chilli starts off as a tingle before working its way along the tongue towards the back of the throat and becoming a more insistent hot force  its not unpleasant but certainly makes its presence felt  chilli heads will love itsan churro the monk would most definitely approve of all of these  it is a privilege to be able to chat to someone with a real commitment and enthusiasm for their product and then also to be able to genuinely say that the chocolates are all sensational flavours with not a dud amongst them  cielo en la tierrachristine i cant remember but ive been back a few times since this review and havent been too shocked by the pricesorry kathy  and to make it worse they are all wonderful
the fig one despite its bright color is the best out of these four im not convinced yet of the plain chocolates worthiness but as choclatique seems to center more around fun designs and flavors they have over  intriguingsounding flavors i guess that isnt of the greatest consequence anyway theyre a bit overpriced at about  each but theyd make great gifts though the angles and colors of this set initially look very unique they do succeed in being entertaining intergalactic chocolatesthey are beautiful almost too perfect to eat
the milk chocolate used in this bar is a fairly hefty  and it does have some promising flavours however these are soon obliterated by the overpowering and slightly sickly coffee flavour contained within each square  when i say sickly i mean just that eating more than a couple of squares in succession would have been too much for mea glance at the ingredients gave me a clue as to why   fat and  carbohydrate  hardly healthy stuff thendont know if youd agree simon but i think the coffee can go well with the chocolate when the coffee is subtle and used more to lift the flavour than to contribute what i mean is if you can tell its coffee there is too muchthat and keeping the fat and sugar a bit on the low side 
just recently the lady of the house and i visited the adelaide central market in our small town this is the place for fresh food and strange things many of the stalls sell chocolate goodies there are chocolate fountains and so on but chocolate was not the purpose of our visit we actually went to buy olive oil and some really nice properly cured ham and grapes and olives and cheese but i digresswe might not have set out to buy chocolate but the place selling that really nicely cured ham was also selling strange imported chocolate as you do i couldnt resist lousy willpower i didnt even really check what i was buying it was chocolate i hadnt seen it before what other reason does one need okaytoday im not even trying to translate the polish im just eating so the first thing impression was mint the aroma is quite strong causing me to take another look at the pack ah hah mint leaves pictured that explains itbased on appearances this should be a mint chocolate bar with a few segments just breaking one off for a taste should donope fail this reminds me of a giant after dinner mint  the kind that were such a big thing about  years ago i have no idea why this is marked with the lines inviting your to break it into segments or pieces because it does not so much break as crumple into pieces leaving a sticky white minty goo everywherethe minty goo is not unpleasant there is just rather a lot of it its very minty and sweet and it gets everywhere this then is not something for sharing unless you are sharing it with a main squeeze or a very good friend if you get my drift my intention was to try a piece and get the rest of family to cast an opinion but it made such a sticky mess that i had to eat the whole thing myself what a shamethis is sweet sticky minty and very retro the chocolate gets lost in the mintiness so its purpose really is to act as a carrier between the mint goo factory and you unlike the old after dinner mints this is a lot bigger imagine about  of those mints to a single pack and once you start you have to keep going  or share intimately if you like mint seek this out if you dont then donthii found the minty one a few times but it was not widely distributed in poland unfortunately its only easy to eat on cold days when the mint goo inside gets a bit firmer it looks yummy to me  sticky and gooey wont put me offi loved the original one with its subtle alcoholic flavoured filling it was one of my favourite snacks at school i didnt even know they still make them  ill have to keep my eyes open for danusia when im in poland 
it was my husband and daughter who visited this place on an outing together  they liked the chocolate mousse pie so much that they phoned me to tell me about it  actually taunting is probably a better word because they didnt buy any to bring home nor any of the chocolates that they tried and loved there eitherthey use belgian and swiss couverture as the base for all of their desserts and chocolates and have dark milk and whitemilk blends on hand to try  two of them are callebaut belgian but i couldnt guess the swiss one  ill just have to revisit and keep tryingwe didnt have time to stay for coffee or cake so i chose a selection to take home and tryill definitely be returning to try the coffee the very famous mousse cake and to find out more from ross the owner chocolate maker and generous giverout of free tastingsthe eggs look so much like the hotel chocolat onesill have to trust your judgement on that maggie because i sob have never sob tried the hotel chocolat sob oneshttpwwwgastronomydominecomuploadedimagesmilkchocolateeastereggjpg
the fistsized fudge cupcake looks like its just bigger than a regular cupcake upon slicing it open you can see that the inside part is softer and creamier i think the huckleberry is only in this part though i could be wrong its hard to resist fudge this ones almost like frosting with the soft filling im glad to see that whoever made this the tag actually doesnt say didnt succumb to using artificial vanilla consequently the plain fudge has quite a strong vanilla tasteand something reminds me of honey the huckleberries considering the other items the fudge was next to theyre obviously the defining factor here id imagine they were grown close by too now the honey honey is sweet right but its sweetness is a flavor in itself and its golden its very flavor is smooth and heavenly its the same sort of thing going on in the fudge only translated to delicious huckleberriesnow i sit here cutting off bit after bit with my knife contemplating how much of a sugar rush i would get if i ate the whole thing at once maybe id better not dont make any special missions to cambria for it but it is an enchanting town so if youre already there this is a nice fudge to pick upcomments are closed
inside the box the square looks just like the others in the range  although theres no gold or silver foil here back to the same old rather cheap looking plastic wrapper unfortunatelyclick on the photo to enlarge it and you might be able to make out the odd tiny fleck of strawberry a little disappointing perhaps  that is until you turn the bar overthe underside is packed with fairly substantial chunks of brightly coloured freezedried strawberry significantly more than i was expectingthe chocolate is smooth creamy and quite sweet with just a hint of strawberry flavour its quite nice in its own right but theres no escaping the big pieces of strawberry in every squareas with all freeze dried strawberries they initially have a slightly cardboardy texture that comes to life as they hydrate in your mouth as they become softer they release that tart tangy hit of fresh strawberries on their own that would be too much but with the sweet milk chocolate they work really wellthe way to eat this bar is definitely to let each square melt slowly on your tongue the flavours and textures both change as the chocolate melts away and its really rather nicei think thorntons has a thing or two to learn from little old canberra in australia  a local chocolate maker here has just brought out a  dark chocolate bar with freeze dried strawberries and sichuan pepper after tasting its complexities and scrumptiousness i dont think i could ever be interested in a milk chocolate with only strawberries poh i dont know i think milk chocolate and strawberries go pretty well but that could just be because its what im craving today or this particular hour at leastah but see if you have a milk chocolate craving thats when youd opt for the curious chocolatiers new caramel milk chocolate with pecans which i plan to have this afternoonit sounds like i work for them doesnt it if only just a bit excited that theres an innovative chocolate bar rather than just truffle maker in canberra
so as the lucky recipient it was my task to select my ten from the forty on offer there were a couple of new twists on familiar flavours and a couple i thought id try as benchmark chocs i also tried to mix up the flavours  although i avoided chocolate covered fruits nuts and coffee beans and all of the marshmallow and fudge which accounts for a whopping forty percent of the catalogue and included only white and dark chocolate because frankly the milk chocolates werent as interestingthe rest of the tin contains a little book  a few sheets of paper with some chocolate facts and recipes a rather unconvincing scratch and sniff notepad and a certificate from the chocolate foundation confirming me as a chocoholic ho humso what did i choosewell from the white chocolate selection i took a whiskey truffle and a womersley golden raspberry with geranium trufflethe golden raspberry and geranium truffle was rather lovely an initial burst of floral sweetness reinforced by the white chocolate was quickly followed by the slightly tart and tangy raspberry cutting some of the sweetness and rounding off the whole thing with a very enjoyable burst of summer fruit flavourthe whisky truffle was a more complex affair a balancing act between the sharpness of the whisky and the sweet white chocolate im not a great fan of scotch whiskey but i did find this promising unfortunately it  didnt quite develop enough for my liking with the whiskey not quite reaching its full potentialmy dark selection began with a lemon truffle it delivered exactly what was promised  smooth lemon flavour in chocolate well balanced not too tart and a smooth filling with good mouthfeelthe mint chocolate was according to the catalogue one of the best mint chocolates weve ever tasted and therefore a definite candidate for tasting mint and chocolate like coffee and chocolate is so often done badly that its probably a public service to track down a half decent mint chocolate this one packed a proper minty punch almost to the point of overpowering the truffle centre the mint was there from the first bite and lingered long after the filling and shell were gone possibly a little over the top for some but definitely minty without being too sweet and sicklya plymouth gin truffle was chosen to see how they fared against cocoa beans gin  tonic bar and im afraid on this occasion i wasnt overly impressed there was some flavour there described as delicate in the brochure but perhaps a little too delicatea womersley balsamic cherry vinegar truffle had me intrigued as soon as i saw it it had a quite unusual slightly tart flavour to it as balsamic chocolate tends to and to be honest i would have liked to have had a second one to hand to continue the flavours in order to see how they developed  it was definitely an enjoyable combination but i wanted to build on the experience and see whether it went fruity or vinegary when concentratedthe raspberry womersley naturally with lavender truffle was outshone by the raspberry and geranium truffle with white chocolate lavender is something of an odd flavour still and this combination just didnt offer the refreshing burst of citrussy floral top notes that its fellow had delivered earlieri had my forebodings about ordering both the dark chocolate violet cream and the rose cream but i havent had a rode flavoured chocolate since another cocoa bean bar and i used to love parma violets as a child so my final two selections were certainly going to deliver big on flavourthe violet cream wasnt too unpleasant but still conatined way too much sugar for my liking and the violet flavour quickly overpowered any chocolate that might have been attempting to impress my palatethe rose cream was both the wrong choice to end on and the perfect choice had i started this tasting with this little dayglo pink monster it would have been abandoned as soon as id bitten into it i can only describe this as resembling the distilled essence of an old ladys chest of drawers a screamingly pink filling which packed an almighty wallop of overpowering rose flavour which obliterated both smell and taste in seconds i couldnt get beyond the first bitehaving seen the price of this selection      id be more inclined to visit a good chocolate shop and pick your own fresh ganaches and truffles the extras arent particularly informative or useful and i cant help but feel that the chocolates were not at their best after theyd been sent to me by post you could buy a dozen handmade truffles in a lovely ballotin for about half of the price of this set and youd be guaranteed better use of flavour and better ingredients i can see how moon estates have spotted a gap in the gifting market for something like this but i dont think the vital part of the deal  the actual chocolates  justifies the pricefor that price i would hope that these were actually made on the moon out of moondust and sunbeamsmy son bought me a name a box chocs for christmas i have not received them yet i have emailed moon estates and out of this world gifts but not received one reply my son is housebound and i thought this was a lovely present but now i am not so sure especially now i have seen how much he paidjust remember that its the thought that counts and he must have thought youd really enjoy themgot chocolates on the  january  very nice too  had to phone customer services though bit worrying when they state delivery in seven days thankyou simon i did enjoy them it was a lovely christmas present and at least they gave me the title of lady on the address which i quite likedyou have caused me to reitnhk my cooking habits young lady i follow you on twitter and thank you for following meif you get the chance check out my work  vineyardfauxcom and

first off was the one in the green wrapper  crunchy mint dark chocolate  as with them all it is sugar freeagave syrup is used instead and contains  cocoa solids sourced from a single origin satipo peru  when opened it emitted a deliciously inviting dark aromasecondly the purple wrapper  activated almond and purple corn dark chocolate  now thats a flavour combination that ive never heard of before  purple corn is a type of maize that is used as a syrup here and supposedly chocfull of antioxidants and other good things  the almonds are soaked in water to help activate their valuable nutrients  somehow theyre dried and roasted again to regain their crunch so theres a fair bit of work involved in just the added ingredients in this bar  and it does taste crunchy as well as dark complex and earthy  it is lower in sweetness compared to the crunchy mint bar but that allows the almonds to shine throughfinally the red organic goji and camu dark chocolate bar  this one is my favourite  the goji berries arent inedibly dry and chewy like some ive tried in health food shops either on their own or covered in chocolate or yoghurty stuff but are sweet toffeeish and combine lovingly with the  chocolate   plus at the end is an inexplicable whitepepper tickle on the taste buds which is intriguing and delicious this is the sweetest of the three bars and it was gone before i could say ooops ive just had three bars or  grams of chocolate in one sitting  which in my chocoworld is a positive thingthe chocolate mint one sounds good i do not know if i would like the other two or nottheyre all worth a try because theyre so different to whats out there and impossible to compare it with anythingthey sound interesting but what bothers me is that they are considered sugar free when they contain fructose agave syrupand corn syrup
my friend and colleague don has been visiting from australias deep north  in this case its not as far north as one can go but townsville in tropical far north queensland land of bananas tea plantations coffee australias own cocoa plantations and gingerit looks like they must make the chocolate ginger themselves  the pack lists no ingredients no nutrition info just the name very similar to some other chocolate ginger ive had before from north queensland i hear that a lot gets sold through local markets  chokky ginger is something of a local cottage industrythe best chocolate ginger i ever had came from a similar area and i rated it  out of  perhaps thats because i remember it better than it really was ill get some more of it one dayto make a really good chocolate ginger it must be root ginger its needs to be crystallised or better a good glac it needs to be big it needs a dark chocolate coating which is not sweet  there is plenty of sweetness in the ginger and there needs to be lots and lots of that coating use a thin sweet milk chocolate coating and its horribleto check i therefore had to chop on of these little suckers upunfortunately the photo does not do justice the piece is so big that you can only just fit it in your mouth we are off to a good start the chocolate is dark and very thick  about  to  mm the ginger is big juicy and luscious chopping it up inspires confidence then i tried it the chocolate has an interesting taste it reminds me a bit of something a little smoky and it melts very slowly not too sweet is it compounded not sure dont care i like it  the ginger is fabulous  sweet spicy chewy and complements the chocolate really wellim really pleased with this one the shop has a web store i might have to order some for delivery in the mail im giving it  out of sounds pretty interesting i do like chocolate but ginger i can only stand in small amounts perhaps i will stay away from this chocolate ginger heremy friends think im crazy but i love ginger  ginger and chocolate together have to be a winning combinationooooh chocolate and ginger are a wicked combination the more ginger the better big lumps iz wickid goodthough the lindt excellence ginger thats just appeared is not too bad either im hoping well have a complete review here soon  i think one of the other contributors has it in the pipeline so im waiting to see the reportthe best chocolate ginger ive ever had is from organic timestheir organic chocolate ginger is delicious the ginger is spicey but toned down by just enough sweetness from the crystallisation their chocolate is devine they use rapadura sugar which has a rich caramel tone and its really one of the best chocolates ive ever had too
then i spotted this new oneusually the argument for slightly downsizing something is due to the ingredients being more expensive to obtain and therefore rather than increase the price and upset their customers they decrease the size so that whilst it looks the same as the other varieties youre actually getting less for your moneyhowever when you open the pack you can see the usual familiar filled squares of cadbury dairy milk which on the ingredients panel makes up seventy percent of the total block  the remaining thirty percent is the berry pannacotta flavoured filling  oh so the berries and the pannacotta mix must be unusual or a bit expensive thennot according to the pack  the ingredients  in order of volume are milk sugar vegetable fat cocoa butter milk solids cocoa mass etc with the chocolate itself containing a fairly low  cocoa solids  i dont see anything here that constitutes an expensive ingredient  surely vege fat isnt a budgetbreakerperhaps my niggling over the invisible  grams the size of an individual bar is minor but its not as uncommon as you think  but how does this tastereally nice darn it all  yes its just a fluffy pink blob of strawberryish filling inside thats been flavoured with whoknowswhat kind of artificial chemical components but with the classic dairy milk chocolate its sweet seductive and results in making you automatically snap off row after row to chomp suck and swallow not a sensible square after squareand darn it twice but if i did happen to lose all sense and reason and control and end up inhaling the entire block in a hard afternoon at the computer then id be rewarded with a whopping  grams of fat  oopscompletely agree about cadburys cynical shaving of g off their blocks im sure people understand that prices of raw ingredients have gone up but they should either just increase the price or introduce obviously smaller versions trying to pass off a slightly smaller bar as the same is just meani noticed that the other day mind you i was in the throes of pms and didnt care i polished off my cashew nut block in one night i havent been that bad for a whilemind you i wanted to hold off on trying the berry pannacotta until someone else did d cheers kath next time i run out of choccie ill have to try some of this stuff fat and all maybe i should invest in a running machine or something incidentally have you tried lindts dark ginger block it tastes like ginger beeryes i have kathy  i have tried the lindt ginger   ive eaten it loved it and submitted a review for this blog  i wont reveal too much but i loved the fact that it had a peppery fizzy taste rather than the usual chunks of ginger in itand yes the berry pannacotta is ideal for those pmsrelated stay at home on the couch dont wanna share moments well i do like cadbury dairy milk once in a while mabe i will try this just for the difference factortried this and have to say i was singularly underwhelmed  could only taste the chocolate and a vague bit of strawberryish stuff in the centre not a patch on the creme bruleefair enough fiona  the creme brulee is indeed magnificent and youll leave more berry pannacotta for me another sugar and fat filled cheep tasting release from cadbury with  sugar cost to cadbury for the g about c  g of mostly cheep fats lets say about c  a tiny bit of cocoa about another c and some flavonoids and packaging best guess c so c production cost to  on the shelves this is not about making good chocolate this is all about profits sorry to be so harsh but this is an ongoing trend to make cheeper chocolate and rely on marketing to help us make the switchhi there i would like to subscribe for this weblog to obtain latest updates thus where can i do it please help
i truly feel bad about this i got this unique bar while on vacation so i kept it nice and wrapped up for a week but on the return drive what happens i realize that the heater is on and the bag the chocolate is in is sitting right in front of one of the vents tragedy didnt make me very happy but oh well i thought it is a  gram bar and since the finer chocolates are usually hearty as pioneers it should be okay tastewise at leastthe looks did suffer most horribly hence my attempt to hide most of the damage in the picture by only showing four of the sixteen squares but a deep and chocolatey smell emanated from it bidding me continue on evidence of the stone ground process is in the chocolates grainier more rocklike look though it still has a good breaking sound inside your mouth you can feel the small bits of chocolate and sugar just as i was considering that they distract too much from the flavor i started to get a soft banana flavor so my assumption was a little off the funniest thing though was that i was reminded so much of biting into mexican hot chocolate minus the cheapnessgoing with my reminder of hot chocolate tazas flavored chocolates are made in the traditional disc shape theyre labeled to be eaten as is or made into hot chocolate i actually made some with this bar just to see how it would turn out very nice like the chocolate itself it has the strength of the historic blended with sophisticated quality and comfortable familiarity worth looking into as something thats different while still easy to catch ontois it indian nameim not sure where the name comes from taza does mean cup in spanish though so maybe they were thinking about hot chocolate again when they named itthis looks like a very interesting product  the sort of thing id like to get my teeth intomaybe chocs away isnt such a bad idea after all   yum this sounds good ive had enjoyed lindt  and enjoyed and will give this a thoughtwell seeing as you have oh so many fans i just watned to say thank you again for sharing your awesome married life with all of usif i do get picked it would be a great belated birthday presentyou guys are wonderful and wish you all the bestkeep bringing much more joy to all of us readerss
gallers philosophy of chocolate making seems to be very much along the lines of one eats with ones eyes first because the presentation of this product is nothing short of superb the box is a curved wedge of blue which flips open to reveal twelve discs of chooclate each adorned with a series of stripes in aquatic blues and greens they are lovely to look at thats for surethe chocolates themselves fall into four categories we have a white chocolate covered disc with fleurs de sel de gurande from brittany and arguably the finest salt in the world more white discs with wakame seaweed then two lots of dark chocolate discs  a set which contains black hawaiian salt and another which contains nori which normally comes in sheets for cooking and sashimi makinginteresting stuff then and certainly a good way of getting my palate going after over a month of being unable to taste properlyso where to beginthe good news for me at any rate is that the white discs conceal a rich dark chocolate filling and the fleur de sel de gurande disc had a sublime balance between the three flavours as the white chocolate rapidly gave way to the filling my mouth was flooded with the rich chocolatesalt combination its mouthwateringly good  as the sweet white chocolate mingles with the dark filling the palate is treated to a beautifully subtle set of flavours which you just want to go on for ever a great blend of tastes and a very auspicious starthaving done salty i decided to stay with the white discs and attempt a wakame chocolateas before there was a dark interior lurking under the white chocolate shell only this time the flavour it delivered was decidedly different the chocolate flavours were much more pronounced and held a slightly sweet mildly tangy note from the wakame never overpowering but obviously present the blend of chocolate and seaweed had me savouring this one right down to the last swirl of the tongue around the mouth excellent combination again and done very wellwhen it came to the dark discs i decided to repeat the tasting orderhaving enjoyed the fleur de sel so much i was looking forward to the sel noir dhawa what could black salt offer and how would it taste the answer was oddly enough darker rich dark chocolate flavours blended with a richer tasting deeper salt tang having tasted quite a variety of salted chocolates of late i am happy to report that this one is right up there with the best a wonderfully smooth filling teases the palate with rich saltiness as the dark chocolate releases its flavours the combination is devastatingly moreishthe finale for me at any rate was the nori chocolatein a similar vein to the wakame chocolate but obviously with much richer dark chocolate flavours the nori disc held another delicate balance of flavours i would have been hard pressed to identify the seaweed flavour as seaweed but it adds a soft subtle almost floral sweetness to the overall tastethese have all the classic hallmarks of posh chocolates from the unusual packaging to the beautiful design of each piece and finally in the subtle and harmonious blend of slightly avante garde flavours jean galler has created chocolates that are a delight for both eye and palate a wait of a couple of years was worthwhile and im looking forward to trying more galler chocolate very soonthese look fantastic and sound like they taste awesome but at that price ill need to save up my money firstit seems to be good and fantasticoh i definitely have to try a couple of those on my next trip to brussels they sound absolutely awesome so thanks for the tip 
his book ramon morato chocolate was awarded the best  chocolate book of the year and he recently appeared at the melbourne food and wine festival  i made sure i had prime seats and was intrigued when he told us that he was using chocovic in his recipe and also proceeded to use a bamix whipper to add extra air and zest that was something id never seen done before to melted chocolate his broken english and humour immediately endeared himself to the audience when he said chocolate is a mold like a dark tshirt it is easy to combine with other clothes other ingredients sorry for my english  when asked by an audience member where he found his inspirations he replied that it mostly came from reading old cookbooks and seeking new ways to update them we dont invent the nothing we rediscover he said  the delicacy he ended up producing for us was his famous macaroon hamburgerusing cocoaflavoured mararoons with caramelised sesame seeds as the buns the meat was a delicious chocovic dark chocolate ganache  sliced peach formed the cheese with mango shreds as the onions fresh mint for lettuce and a fresh berry coulis for the ketchuphe was inspiring enough for me to immediately head to the chocovic stand to buy some of the chocolate  they had four flavours on offer as part of their selvaticas  exotic tastes range that celebrate the lush rainforests that most of their cocoa is sourced fromtheir first block jaina is white but contains  cocoa solids  this presented a quandary for me  is it chocolate or not  on very first nibble it tasted like all very sweet white chocolate but as the seconds ticked by the distinct added tang of yoghurt was also present  the wrapper told me that it has aromas sweeter than vanillascented milk full of the promise of melted caramel you can taste at the base of your teeth  you sense the combination of sugar and acidity  nicely saidi really enjoyed this  for a white chocolate  and found it surprisingly moreish  i could manage about four squares or  grams which is half the block but no more because of its sweetness and thats saying something for someone who can polish off a  gram family block without the family being presentthe second block nayarit is a milk chocolate with  cocoa solids and informed me that as it melts between the tongue and palate is reveals three distinctive flavours in turn sweet bitter and saltythats a pretty big claim for a mild milk chocolate but the tasting did reveal it to be surprisingly complex again with a yoghurt tang to add intrigue  the chocolate itself doesnt have the classic silky smooth easymelt texture that you associate with say swiss chocolate but has a powdery texture that does indeed hint at salty flavours amongst the sweetboth blocks are unusual and cant be directly compared to standard white and milk chocolate  id love to see what ramon makes with these two blocks but maybe ill have to save up for his cookbook to find outhi kath do you know ifwhere this can be found in melbourne might have to send my brother on a mission for me hannah if you visit the san churro coffeechocolate shops ones in fitzroy and ones in highpoint i know off the top of my head they stock this range of chocolate and use it as the base for their own handmade chocolates as wellthanks kath ive heard of the jaina white with its yogurt inclusion before and have been intrigued im hoping to visit my brother some time in august so will have to add the san churro shops to the chocolate itinerary can anyone confirm these are the ingredients pleaseazcar manteca de cacao leche desnatada en polvo leche entera en polvo mantequilla anhidra emulgente lecitina de sojaif so it contains butterfat unlike most premium chocolates i was also looking at chocovics nayarit  cacao and the ingredients i found on the internet said aroma not vanilla so if anyone can confirm this it would be a great help to me
where to start with this one firstly the plastic pack is reminiscent of so many other cheap nasty things that come in similar plastic packs the picture on the front conveys another product with nuclearreactor inspired red colour first impressions can be misleading though as we are about to findopening that plastic pack leads to the first big surpriseyes inside is a small cardboard box nicely printed these people take things seriously after all and inside the box we have two squares of chocolate coated yumminess each is about  cm squarethe size does not seem much but it turns out to be just about right the picture on the outside of the pack still had me worried though is the inside really glowinthedark red a dissection is in ordernope the picture on the pack has a colour shift if there is any colour there at all its a very pale pink tingesadly both of the children dont like td which means i get to share it with the lady of the house and shes not super keen on td either  so yippee i get the big pieceomg you and i are like spiritual twins  i also seek out the cherry ripes and then the turkish delight in a box of mixed chocolates  freaky no
they were doing a roaring trade the day i was there so i quickly grabbed three blocks  dark grand marnier dark almond and dark mocca and a handful of small barsi wasnt prepared to shell out a further twelve dollars for the rather tackylooking chocolate museum but would love to hear from anybody who has been inside  was it worth it to see a  piece chocolate mosaic of dame edna a chocolate village with working trains a one tonne block of chocolate and a slowgrowing chocolate stalagmite or would i be better entertained by chewing one of my own legs off  sadly whilst the chocolate is belgian callebaut in fact what hes done to it has been very disappointing  the grand marnier and mocca blocks dont have fillings but have been infused with some kind of flavour that makes them taste overly fake and renders the oncereasonablechocolate into a cheap tasting product that i couldnt finish  the almond block was similarly uninspired and very stingy on the amount of actual nuts includedthe individual bars were fine  just ok  i guess its hard to mess up milk chocolate if its got nice fillings included like cherry caramel honeycomb or nuts in it but im not under any illusion that panny or his creators are any creative genuises in the world of chocolate or able to produce any groundbreakingly unique additional flavours or be stocked by city supermarkets any time soon  no but theyve got a great location  the sole chocolate manufacturer on an island that teems with cashedup visitorsive tried the grand marnier one before and found it a bit lacking as well not keen to try any others after reading this review either i went through the choc museum which cost  for my family and took us only an hour to go through  walking slowly thought it might be worth as wed get lots of complimentary chocolate  was i wrong  lucky to get three pieces the museum was entertaining enough which starts off with an interesting display of history and gadgets used making chocolate thats followed by some puzzles and the dame edna piece a tonne piece of choc then room with a long conveyer where you can make your blob of choc and see the innards of the factory theres a cutesy animatronic display which will entertain anyone under  you can then pay  to see a bar of choc made through a machine that makes sounds like the everlasting gobstopper machine oh theres also a wall of choc the tips over every couple of mins wasnt tacky at all but it is also a tad overpriced for what it is  especially when theyre scoungy with the choc then we paid another  for a small bag of truffles and a bar of choc its nice choc but is it any better than what you can get at the supermarket not for mine best bit for me  the lamb curry at the cafe  and you get a huge serve and it was fantasticamazing service amazing chocolate it was great that everything was halal and also i was able to pray in a room upstairs which was fantastic because its usually hard to find places which accomadate muslims and our prayer times 
the first two products i tried are a lip balm and a shower gellush products are not cheap the whip stick costs over four pounds and the sonic death monkey is about the same for a g and sold in bigger bottles still  if youre looking for a touch of chocolate goodness that lasts longer than a bar of chocolate then you could definitely do a lot worse than these
with the temperature here in london hitting c its possibly not the best time to be reviewing chocolate but i had this sat on my desk and i wanted to try it so i had no other choice but to review it toothis g bar is an organic  dark chocolate and as you can see  its divided into  small chunkswhen you pop a chunk into your mouth you immediately realise why the coffee flavour is intense really intense if the chunks were any bigger it would be too much but as it is each little chunk is enough to give you a short sharp coffee hitthe flavour is so strong that its difficult to taste the actual chocolate but the texture is smooth no grainy bits here and on a hot day like today it melts away quickly on the tongue there is a slight fruitiness at the end but theres really not much sweetness i found it just a little too strong for my tastes but even so i did find myself eating chunk after chunk without even realising i was doing it its certainly a nice little pickmeup for an afternoon in a warm officeif youre not a coffee fan then youre definitely not going to like this  its a basically a strong cup of black coffee in solid form if thats how you take youre coffee then id definitely recommend giving it a go it was a little too strong for my tastes but its clearly made with some quality ingredientsi love green  blacks and i love coffee chocolate  if anyone finds this in australia please let us knowid disagree with you on the intense coffee flavour  i was actually very disappointed after buying some of this a few weeks back and wont be buying it again gb get a big fat fail from me im afraid  although their maya gold is sublime grumpytart  not sure how you can not think this has an intense coffee flavour its probably the most intense coffee chocolate ive had  just found a couple of other reviews that confirm my opinion i dont know why you didnt get that coffee hit but i stand by my review maybe i got a dodgy bar  but all i could taste was dark chocolate this is on my review list looks fab i hope the coffee hit is as strong as you decribe itjimi wonder how it compares to conscious superb espresso barthirding the plea for anyone to let us know if this is available in australia ive been longing for an affordable coffee dark chocolate  love the michel cluizel but its too expensive too buy regularly and ive tried the lindt coffee intense several times but honestly cant taste any coffee at all  coffee lindtoh ill definitely give it a try  im a fan of strong coffee aromas and flavours so i think this one will be just right for me is it available in the shops already or did you get a sample somewherejust found this in my local corner shop felt like we hadnt done any gb for ages so i bought it
in these days of bright and shiny wrappers its nice to take a break with the simple wax paper necco uses the dusty with what white powder i really dont know quartersized wafers that make sounds like poker chips when banged together also feel like remnants of a bygone era and their taste it reminds me of a chocolate malt from a vintage soda fountain yes that does mean that the chocolate taste is more artificial than not but can we really expect more chocolate is the third ingredient coming after sugar and corn syrup which must make up the bulkand thats all there is to them very simple even for a candy but thats why they stay such a simply endearing sweetoh yeah  i have loved these for over  years i just wish they werent so good as i only buy them half as often as i like because i eat the whole pack without pause though i commit at the time of purchase to savoring them loloh my good god they look horrible where can you get them i really want to try them they look horrible but you really want to try them well i hope you do end up liking them they can be hard to track down its hard to tell who sells them ive seen them at antique stores or old west towns    i found this particular pack at a gas station you just have to keep your eyes open or you can google them it looks like there are a few places that sell them online
these beauties include the  amacado from peru the  el cuador from ecuador a  from tobago and a serious  tembadoro from trinidadrightio  the  tembadora from trinidad in the caribbean  the cocoa from this area is grown in small plantations but rausch are working with the university of the west indies to continue their work on the worlds largest cocoa genetic database  nerdy but important  this is a really laidback dark chocolate without the usual salivasucking bitterness that can tend to assail the first taste  instead it gives hints of dark earthy soil coffee and fine dusty cocoa  it is dense in texture and slow to melt but a very mild introduction to a chocolate that being  is in serious dark side territorytobago  is a near geographic neighbour of trinidad yet the flavours are quite different  whilst it too is fairly mild for something so dark it is much drier on the palate  i needed a drink after just one segment and there was nowhere near the complexity of flavours that tembadora has  whilst there is no bitterness but the overall effect is a bit too gluggy and heavyel cuador  is very very nice  there are a lot of  chocolates out there and this one can stand proudly alongside the best of them  it has a sweet smoky flavour with hints of wood dried grasses and tobacco  can you tell ive done a tasting coursethe  amacado is named after the region in peru that has with nearly  families growing the cocoa as part of a cooperative   this one tastes remarkably stronger than  and thats meant in a good way  clearly the cocoa is top quality  of all four this is the one that melts most easily allowing some sweetness to emerge and then a whisper of coffee  this is my favourite  excellent cocoa taste with a generous inclusion of cocoa butter to allow the flavours to come through with bells oncomments are closed
chocolatecovered pretzels are their biggest item  but they also throw in some other things like fortune cookies the merry packaging of the one laurie sent me is pretty standard as theyre designed with occasions in mind birthdays baby showers etc in this particular case i do love all the pink frills against the simple silver chinese takeout box nestled inside on pink paper shreds was a caramelcoated chocolatedipped fortune cookie protected in its own wrappings you do get that birthdaysense undoing so many curled ribbonsthe regularsized cookie is tempting with a very thick coating of caramel chocolate chocolate chips and sprinkles it doesnt just look like lots of chocolate either its a very dominant part of the taste theres just the right bit of caramel to set off the crunch of the lightly sweet cookie my fortune was success is at your fingertips  open your eyes maybe if they added something about chocolate in there too  chocolate is at your fingertips or maybe notit seems like the fortune cookies usually come in pairs which makes sense one isnt quite enough given the prices youll want to keep them for their intended purpose as party favors or gifts instead of just getting them as sweets for yourself but they suit that purpose well enoughcomments are closed
and then this warning this product may contain traces of bee pollen and propolis which can cause severe allergic reaction and may contain traces of dairy and peanutsexcept its all capitals and fairly shouts out and the grammar is lousy and what the heck is propolis turns out its a bee resin and the really weird thing is the ingredients dont list honey what is going on hereso im a little miffed and off to a poor startmy supermarket pack turns out to contain  gosh smaller packs each containing  things that look a bit like a sesamestudded biscuit with a bit of chocolate layed over the top in cutesy line unusual how the chocolate comprises the claimed  i dont know because it certainly looks to be substantially lessbreaking one we see that there is a heck of a lot of sesame here it smells vaguely of honey and looks like the sesame seeds are held together with some kind of stuff  which is probably sugar there really isnt a lot of chocolatein spite of my whinging its actually not bad ive just demolished one of the small packlets from inside and find it all the rather moreish sweet and with a decent whack of sesame flavour the chocolate is really there as a bit of a bonus it contributes little if anything to the flavourthis is nothin like that halva but im still pleasantly surprisedoh i love these things they had them on sale at not quite right a few months back for c each and i stocked up all gone now im afraid id bought them a few times as well  firstly to review for this blog but then i kept munching on them and forgetting to review them theyre dangerously moreish and easy to gobble up before realisingi ate these like crazy while in australia and brought some back to the states but am running out does anybody know where i can find these over here  colorado in particular or a website where i can order themjoy
the main difference is of course the format paul youngs caramels are large individual chocolates with a lot of caramel whereas the chunks of this bar are smaller with a higher chocolate to caramel ratioi would like to mention the packaging briefly too which i wasnt overly impressed with i dont know if this was wrapped differently for the goody bags but clear cellophane stuck together with sellotape doesnt give an overwhelming sense of luxury  even with the addition of the best british chocolatier tag the chocolate in this bar is listed at  but it tastes darker and richer to me in fact id go so far as to say its a little too rich for my tastes it is very very nice but i would have preferred just a little more sweetnessand the same is true of the caramel inside the flavours are great  a slightly smokey caramel with just the right amount of salt but its just a bit too rich for me meaning its quite difficult to get through the whole bar in one go without sharing and i dont do sharingas you can see from this photo the caramel is thick enough to withstand being cut with a knife if id done the same with one of pauls caramels i suspect the caramel would probably be all over the table carpet and me before id had a chance to take the picturemy overall impression of this bar is that it really is quite delicious but having tasted paul a youngs sea salted caramels on more than one occasion anything else is only going to come a poor second even something as good as thisarggg ive gotta stop reading the salted caramel reviews it makes me quite jealous i do believe that this caramel is going to be too much whetting and delectable for choco mongers
there isnt any information that states what percentage of cocoa solids are in it and the segments are rather large  like eight easter eggs  i found  after a bit of intensely pleasurable experimentation  that the best way to enjoy one of these eggshaped segments of mousse noir is to sample the chocolate itself first by nibbling all the corners off  it tastes like  percent cocoa solids to me sweet creamy and a nice introduction to darkthen when your fingers are starting to melt the chocolate and theres no corners to hold bite the egg in half and allow it melt on your tongue slowly and langorously  youll find that the mousse inside is dense rich and creamy  as it should be the lush chocolate coating lingers a little longer than the filling heightening the lovely experience and tickling the taste buds  then when it is all gone eat the other half and repeat the pleasure the ingredients and nutrition panels are fairly brief but i was surprised to see hazelnuts and soya flour there as neither were detectable by my palate  camille blochs mousse chocolat noir isnt super bitterly dark or super scarily posh but a really genuine top notch block to enjoy at home on the sofa with a hot cup of tea a decent dvd playing and your better half the look of the chocolate is so appealing mouthwatering oh that does look mighty deliciousits so  good dangerously good
i received a sample of each of their three caramels starting at the white chocolate end of the spectrum we have the carrot cake caramel the top is white chocolate over a beautifully dark orangecolored cocoa butter caramel with pecan pieces and carrots it has a definite carrot cake smell and tastes like thats what youre biting into the caramel is nice and chewy like a heavier cake the white chocolate lends sweetness to the mixture and while the pecans are soft enough that theyre not very crunchy they do add a pleasant taste and texture i found myself sad as i closed the box on the two remaining carrot cakes but there were more to trythe passion fruit caramel is dipped in milk chocolate ive finally realized that i dont like passion fruit yet it was perhaps all the more clear after making this discovery that this is a highquality product though the bite is too much for me the passion fruit has a strong  tropical fruitiness its a very fresh flavor their flavors are meant to work as one unit but what i can taste of the chocolate and caramel as individuals is goodmoving both up and down the chocospectrum is the black forest the caramel has amarelle cherries and  dark chocolate but is dipped in white chocolate which is in turn sprinkled with bits of dark chocolate these all seemed to have extra trouble pulling away from their papers maybe from the extra melting quality of the added chocolate anyway this one turned out to be my favorite i usually do love chocolate caramels since caramel is already a fun thing and having chocolate only makes it better theres a standard tartsweet effect here with the cherries and white chocolate with the dark chocolate bridging the gap between them i think theres a little too much white chocolate but once it melts away you can still reach the richness of the dark chocolate its just how any good dessert should be yet so often isnt you dont want the taste to go away so you settle into a chewingsucking combo to get the most out of it one piece can go such a long wayamella has come up with a way to reminisce over other edible experiences while still embracing a new take definitely recommendedim confused by these is the cocoa butter used in the actual caramel or is it that the chocolate coating is real as in not using some sort of vegetable oil fillers i looked at the ingredients and the cocoa butter is way down at the end just above salt  so i wasnt sure if the cocoa butter was for the coating or the actual caramelsorry didnt mean to submit that so quickly anyway i tasted them all and while theyre nice theyre very expensive compared to other artisan caramels  but i give them props for the unique flavorsthe cocoa butter is used in the caramel itself separate from the chocolate coatingas for price they are up there but i dont have other artisan caramels to compare them to so in itself i think theyre worth itthanks i am always looking for more choices for dipping itemsits a name sake what can i say luv it luv it luv itoh these sound so nice unfortunately i can never sample them as i live in england and i doubt they could be shipped here
im not sure these earn the epithet of luxury artisan chocolates after all theyre a couple of quid a box and theyre sold in tesco and i think we all know that isnt the sign of a true luxury artisan product dont weopening the box revealed half a dozen quite attractive looking truflles made with a  cocoa dark chocolate shell which houses a dark truffle centre filled with chopped cherry a quick sniff upon opening the box confirmed that there were indeed cherries and natural cherry flavourings around which was a promising signi think these are more your posh pocket money present chocolates something to buy your first serious girlfriend or a slightly upmarket mothers day gift from a small child or teenager artisan they may not be but theyre not half bad for the moneyor in my case weekly shopping staplei love these chocs but for some reason theyve disappeared from the face of the earth and the memory from childhood is correct believe it or not it was cadburys roses they used to have a black cherry cream oh and walls did a black forest cornetto in the s as welli also have a issue with black forest gateau and anything cherry related
oh what promise these start with a name like orange bliss means something special something out of this worldhowever im sorry but a maker called ultra fine foods doesnt have much of a ring to it and i find it puts me off a bit the name just seems a bit pretentiousso i was looking forward to trying another orange choc creation sadly i have to report these chaps are a disappointing the chocolate is fine the orange isnt by this i mean the orange just isnt thereclearly somebody else is trying to muscle in on the act by making an imitation they failedthese little chaps are about the size shape colour and construction of the fruchoc but the execution has not quite made the grade the chocolate as i said above is ok good in fact but the fruit in the middle is just plain ordinary nothingy the test is simple suck on a fruchoc and let it melt slowly until only the fruit in the middle is left chew it flavour  lots now suck one of these orange bliss things let the chocolate melt away the fruit in the middle has a strange texture im too polite to say what it makes me think of then chew it no orange nothing really just stuffwe are having no trouble ploughing through the packet and the kids pronounce them to be ok but these are nothing specialhow dare they presume to even consider competing with the venerable frochoc
lovely shop assistant siwei had thoughtfully written a kind of tictactoe inspired diagram that listed the flavours id selected just in case id forget when i got home  i hoped it wouldnt be necessary as surely chocolates that arent exactly cheap would be easy to tell apartjust to be sure though they arei very carefully cut each one of the nine little art works in half not only to photograph but also to share with my husband love chunks and daughter sapphire who always know when its time to hang around nearby  however i need to apologise to dom because my greed and need were too great to stop and take any further photographsfirstly the negatives which to be honest arent really negative  yes the luxury truffles milk and dark and the dark chocolate truffle sound nice but heres a shoutout to posh chocolate makers everywhere  please stop dusting them in cocoa  all it does it leave dust marks on my front mess on my fingers and fill my mouth with dry and bitter dirt before any nice chocolate flavours emerge  so three out of nine here were already little dust bombs with two looking more like something my dog tends to leave in our front garden that overrode the actual chocolate inside oh wellluckily the rest of the six were just fine  the four stand outs  and ones ill be buying more of were the dark chocolate with raspberry  fine dark filling with tiny raspberry seeds to remind me of the quality ingredients praline with roasted coconut  a triumph with the coconut shreds producing an extra crunchy toffee flavour dark chocolate ganache with lemon peel oil delicious and delicate and praline cream with peanut butter  a sensation of milk chocolate peanut butter and a pinch of saltiness that was utterly deliciousthe dark chocolate ganache with spices was nice or ok  nothing earth shattering and the milk and white chocolate mousse got the same reactionin summary i can see that ill just have  yes have to dear reader  go back and try them all so that i can formulate my own collection of stand outs  all without cocoa dust of coursei agree the peanut butter one is one of my favourites as well the only other one ive tried from those youve listed is the dark choc ganache with spices i seem to remember not picking up much of a flavour with that onethats right christine  the spice one wasnt as full of flavour as it should have been in my opinion the lemon peel and the raspberry flavours were stand outs though and ill be buying them again thats for sure
my experience with these little things has been confusing i had one at first and didnt like it at all a couple days later i thought they were rather good so let me try and balance out these two opposite experiencesthese chocolates have very much of a warm walnut brownie taste to them especially with the inner filling this means that theres lots of chocolateyness and lots of sugar so it follows naturally that the degree of liking will depend on the person and their mood sometimes youre in the mood for simpler pleasures sometimes youre not then there are the people who dont even like to waste their time with things like this but for a small pleasure like the brownies they remind me of id say hersheys did a nice enough jobi was at someones house recently and they served hersheys kisses filled with some type of berry filling not sure if it was raspberry or strawberry now  my experience was similar to yours  they were different and i thought wowthese are good  when i bought my own bagthey didnt same as goodmaybe like you say it depends on the mood
as you can see its darker than milk chocolate but lighter than a really high cocoa content bar might be the smell of it is very toppy  all citrus and light wood aromas with a slightly sweet note in there this is further amplified when tasting the chocolate melts very quickly flooding the mouth with sweet citrussy high notes i had the distinct impression that there was quite a lot of sugar involved as well but the packaging doesnt give a breakdown of content by percentage texture and sweetnesswise it reminded me of the seeds of change dark chocolate i recently reviewedits certainly not as deep tasting as a high cocoa content dark bar and the more complex cocoa flavours are somewhat obscured by the sweetness but it was certainly popular with my randomly selected tasting friends i personally found it a little too sweet on my palate and found myself wishing for less sweet and more cocoa it was pleasant enough but not outstanding enough for me to want to rave about it to all and sundry perhaps it would work well as a bridge between milk and dark  a gateway chocolate to use someone elses terminologytheres no official uk importer for this product i picked it up in belfast but i have a feeling that other delis and health food stores might stock it i would certainly be interested in trying a darker colombian bar sometime to see if the cocoa flavours are any more intense when concentratedhello simon
the caramelised macadamias add an interesting flavour too they have just a hint of sweetness and a touch of salt with a very slightly burnt flavour coming in at the end theyre finely chopped so theres no large chunks to contend with and they add just the right amount of crispy crunchy texturei can certainly see why this won an academy of chocolate award  it really is rather good  and the fact that its available somewhere as accessible as thorntons means that anyone should be able to get their hands on iti dont think you can go wrong with macadamia and if you add a pinch of salt it has to be good ill keep my eyes open for this little bardo you know if theyll be releasing the milk tonka bean bar that won the silver it sounds highly intriguinglottie i do know and the answer is yes theres  new bars being introduced and the tonka bean is one of themi am incredibly utterly completely and allencompassingly jealousdo thorntons have any stores here in australiaanyoneim in agreement here  very moreish little bar with a great combination of flavours easy to see why it garnered an award i too am looking forward to the tonka bean barlottie i reviewed the strawberry limited edition just last night it should be published fairly soon i wont tell you what i thought of it yet but am interested in your opinion djames are you the chocolate mission in disguisebought this and the tonka bean milk chocolate bar today very much enjoyed the macadamia bar but i think the tonka bar has the edge it took a lot of self restraint not to finish it in one go but im proud to report i still have two squares left
if thats not worthy enough theyre also developing three other projects for communities that include harvesting gubinge no i dont know what it is either in broome western australia finding and installing a cacao press for the mayan network in xoconusco mexico so that they can cold press cacao licor into powder and butter and finding a similar press for the cacao growers in peru to increase their capacity and include more growers in their collectivewe decided to try their raw organic plain chocolate albeit with lucuma and maca no i dont know what they are either but they sound like two guys i went to high school with as christian had given us a taste of algave syrup and it was a pleasantly thin dark sweet treacly liquid that they use instead of processed sugar  being australian and usdacertified organic also lent it extra greenie credas you can see the chocolate doesnt have the standard glossiness of commercial varieties and instead has a slightly powdery coating  biting into it the differences were made even more obvious  the cocoa and other powders were evident giving it a taste similar to a dense chocolate brownie or flourless mud cake  it wasnt overly sweet so the cocoa could feature clearly and be appreciated as a single ingredient  overall the taste was cool like a tiny million little bubbles were being activated causing a refreshing mouthfeel that felt like the tightly compressed ingredients were gradually coming loose as they relaxed melted and separated in my mouth  stay tunedinteresting review id like to see fairtrade and organic ingredients featuring a lot more in mainstream chocolate but its well worth seeing what chocolate can be like when those qualities are taken to an extreme like this in terms of health effects i wonder how the extra cocoa butter fat balances out against the extra antioxidants and reduced environmental damage also the good karma of buying something so right on must surely helpoh dear sophie you should probably check your facts before resorting to calling things twaddle or do you get food poisoning every time you eat raw fruit or veg and lets not get into the millions of bacteria inside you that you need in order to survivethe beans in raw chocolate are not roasted thats the whole point
for generations israeli children have been split on the issue of the perfect chocolate spread one of the main contenders has always been hashachar haoles offering back when i was a child no packed lunch was complete without a sandwich spread with the above as teenagers we took it along on our school trips and started each day with some coffee and a sandwich made out of digestive biscuits and a generous helping of this spreadeven today when the market is full of posher alternatives hashachar haole is still the spread of choice for nostalgic israeli parents who pass on the love to their children it is you can say an institutionbut what does it taste like and how does it compare to other spreads on the market i figured its time to revisit my childhood obsession and find outsadly having tried it i must say that hashachar haole is rather disappointing in todays standards its neither refined nor indulgent in flavour but just very very sweet id say  pure sweetness and  chocolate flavour this is not surprising considering the fact that sugar seems to be the main ingredient in this spreadunfortunately there is also a strange aftertaste involved that is rather sickly so i found i couldnt eat more than a tiny amount unless i spread a it quite thinly on something large enough to mitigate the effectluckily in spite of its thick consistency hashachar haole spreads easily and effectively on sandwiches of both the bread and biscuit varietythe verdictif youre used to more upmarket spreads you probably wont like this one very much its a basic product designed to satisfy childrens sweet tooth in the simplest and quickest way possible its a relic from simpler times when all that was required from a chocolate spread was to be brown and sweet as such it does work to this day my  year old brother would happily demolish a jar of the stuff as a snack if he were allowed to do so  being kosher parev or parve hashachar haole is  also suitable for vegans and those who are lactose intolerant as it contains no dairy ingredients thats about as far as it goes though the rest is pure nostalgiashimrit i dont doubt for a second that the spread is too sugary and sickly for an adult palate but you guys ate this in your school lunchtime sandwiches  whoah that sure beats my vegemite and cheesei grew up on this and my mom still finds it in ny and sends me on request to tx   i looked at the photo and noticed why the taste was off  when i grew up in israel way back when there was only one kind of spread now the brand has   the yellow top one you reviewed is parve meaning no milk products in it therefore it not even real chocolate  if you want to sample the one that is famous and most popular then find the whiteclear top one and review that  that one is the original and still taste the same as when i was a boyi like it very much but the problem is how to access it in my country because its not even easy to get in the market infact the product is amazinglet me also recommend their kosherforpesach bakers chocolate  look for it this time of year and stock upwho the hell are you shimrit are you kiddin me this is the best chocolate in the whole world it is an awesome chocolate what are you talking about i gave it to friends and roommates here in ny one was a french guy they were literally mesmerized they did not believe it they were overcome by taste and flavor of this amazing chocolate i dont know what youre talking about you ate the parve one which is really nothing to rave about but try the regular the milky one then youll see what it means heck i grew up on this chocolate spread i got used to its taste but not having tasted it for a while then eating it again  it was a heavenly experience i tell ya but you really gotta have the milky the dairy one not the parve the parve is no good i agree but the milky one with its vanilla smell and all the aroma that it reeks  its something to really rave about dont confuse anybody here trust me that chocolate spread is like something  if you havent eaten from it yet  is something like youve never had in your life trust me  pure sweetness and  cocoa what else do you want with it thats exactly what chocolate is sugar and cocoa theres nothing healthy about it but its a desert its a delicacy if you will what else do you want it to have its sugar cocoa and flavors thats all i dont understand
the milk chocolate no cocoa percentages are listed on these three tastes like carob just a little and i kind of like the dusty touch though the carobhaters may not it also has a rather delicious sweetness lingering on the edges i quite like it i think you can tell this ones sugar free though but if it tastes good whats so bad about thatthe dark  well its an alternative he seems to be the child of dove and carob and hes a little  odd but if you give him a chance aka a second piece he kind of starts to grow on you at first it doesnt seem to have much depth then a roundness comes out in the flavors thats rather intriguingthere were also four caramel truffles two milk and two dark the milk is somewhat strangely the one in the darker color as i unwrapped it i considered how most caramel is almost pure sugar and likewise probably tricky to get right without sugar its the gooey sticky kind of caramel they went for and it ends up as simple as a rolo  more like candy yet still enjoyable i think im even liking not having all the sugar in the dark truffle mr carobdove and the softertasting caramel have a funny combo theres an almost salty taste i think the milk worked better but this ones decent enoughsugarless is what amber lyn set out to do and its obvious thats what they do best definitely worth looking into if you need or want to stay away from sugar theyre also gluten free carb conscious and preservativefree they have a wide range of flavors too so youll have plenty of new ones to tryas someone whos had to be on a sugarfree diet before id say these are some of the better sugarfree chocolate bars on the market  however try out the flavored ones theyre better than the plain ones  their milk chocolate orange is delicious  i like these because they use a high grade of malitol sugar alcohol sugar alternative which doesnt give me any side effects like the cheap stuff used in say dove their sugarfree chocolate makes me pretty sickgood review except for the fact that i would have to disagree with you on the carob comment  i grew up drinking carob milk and eating carob  these chocolates do not taste like carob  i think the chocolate bars are ok but i love the coconut truffles and dark caramel truffles  ive tried a lot sugar free chocolate and these are by far the besthi anthony i havent tried this with added baking soda thuogh i have seen candy recipes using sugar that called for it its on my wanttoexperimentwith list honey candy is a bit different than sugar candy in that it tends to be softer no matter what i do outside of refrigeration at least in my experiences so far i certainly havent tried all of the recipe combos out there thuogh   am still learning when it comes to candymaking
sounds like my kind of confectioneryfurther reading told me that the chocolate is made from the finest cocoa to give a rich aroma to create an unforgettable eating experiencenow i dont know what youre thinking at this point dear reader but it struck me that the contents of this packet were going to have to be quite something if they were going to live up to this kind of hypenow i have to say that you cant really fault moserroth for presentation the chocolate minibars look the part alright so far so good but as we all know the proof of the pudding lies in the eating and that is preceded by the smell test and this im afraid to say was where things started to go downhillas you might expect theres a good strong citrus tang but little in the way of a rich aroma  popping a piece into my mouth had me reaching for the packet to check the ingredientswhysugarjust under half of this chocolate is sugar  g of every hundred in fact a lot of sugar what that does for me at least is to destroy any chance of appreciating the cocoa flavours no matter how fine the cocoa may besorry aldi but its not a winner i do wonder whether this would be popular in the us thoughits not the worst thing ive ever tried but calling it finest gourmet chocolate is a huge misunderstandingyeah it looks nice but i didnt enjoy it either but then i didnt enjoy aldis choceur chocolateit wouldnt work for this girl in the us i prefer my chocolate dark at least  if the bar is half sugar i wouldnt eat it id toss it not everyone in the us likes sugar bomb chocolate thanks for the warning on this bar thoughthe chocolate doesnt look like it was tempered properly lighter specksi am in san francisco usa but i always go with my local mom and pop shop aida opera candies in burlingame check them outyou guys are picky this is very good chocolate not the best by any means but veryvery good for the money i was impressed and have been sharing it with family for quite a while now extra sugar or notits good stuff for the price if you are reading this and you havent tried it yet go for itthis is by far the best chocolate product that aldi has to offer i absolutely love the slivers of almond and soft pieces of citrus embedded in this wonderfully crafted chocolate a great product for an excellent price i recommend all chocolate lovers to try this one outim not as rich i could afford to pay for crap next time i buy a better price vs value rating 
cadbury have now also revamped the packaging and the cheap looking plastic wrapping is gone  replaced by cardboard and foil taking another leaf out of the lindt book even though it doesnt contribute to the contents just having the packaging look a bit less cheap does automatically make this feel like a more upmarket productoh dear im a little disappointed firstly opening the pack and checking the back reveals what seem like lots of nuts and the pack does state almonds at  of the totalbut its just not very nutty its kind of sweet  and thats borne out again from the ingredients list where the dark chocolate is only  cocoa how is that dark what happened to the  the number  ingredient is sugar  and it shows this is inoffensive  theres nothing wrong with it and the rest of the family think its not too bad but they do agree that its sweet we all agree that almonds dont have a particularly strong flavour so getting it to be really nutty might be difficult but it should be better than it isafter some of the others in the range have lifted the bar  this one is a bit of a disappointment unless you like sweet then youll love itah yes of the old gold only the one actually marked as  plain is   the rest are   still as you say theyre runofthemill alwaysreliable inoffensive and affordable kind of like the quaffing wines of the chocolate worlddamn i love dark chocolate and almonds too at  i think ill give this one a misshunt down one of the others if you can find someone who brings in polish chocolate get a wawel gorzka krakowska its good really goodrevamping the packaging included resizing the bars from g down to g but keeping the price the same an effective  price increase  cadbury and a lot of the other manufacturers in australia are desperate to sneak all their underhanded price rises in before december when unit pricing laws mean stores will have to display how much everything costs per kg regardless of the size of the bars g g  or ga complete underhanded con and there has been a consumer backlash against them as a resulti have to agree that and changing the formulationi must try and get a before and after block and do a side by side comparison  if my local supermarket still has any of the before blocks lefti have to admit though that cadbury is off my shopping list nowi am eating it right now and i agree that its too sweet for a dark chocolate i prefer ones with really bitter tastei was also disappointed when the first ingredient listed was sugar haha thats great that you were honest i got the email from them but the  offer  didnt aeappl to me at all i think their marketing people whilst its good that theyre thinking of talking to bloggers just have it all wrong send it to us and if we like it we can talk about it but entering a comp if we write the most gushing review about it is just wrong just my c of course
rauschs plantagen plantation range was developed in  to highlight eight different but key cocoa producing regions producing blocks of singleorigin chocolate with varying cocoa contents for keen chocaholics to try  the cocoa contents range from  to  but im trying the first four in the range todaythe first thing that struck me was how beautifully packaged they are in colour graduations to indicate the increase in cocoa content from the mild  to   their envelope frontopening also reminds me of the winning wonka bars from the original  movie  very enticing indeed and hinting at the richness hiding withinundressed the chocolates still look gorgeous with a distinct change in colour the higher up the cocoa scale  starting from lightest to darkest we havebut how do they tastethese are all uniquely delicious together or separately  im really looking forward to trying the next four in their range  i love this jobi live in the usa and a friend of a friend from austria brought back a box of these chocolates you reviewed they are lovely ive never had chocolate as good as these in the usa my favorite in this range is the  then the  so so deliciouskristin oliver from premier food and beverages told me that they have huge containers of bite sized samples and that its always the  that goes first in their staff roomare these chocolates  eggfree meatfree gelatinfree
the consensus was that yasminas winning cocoa electric chocolates werent actually that great but weve been lucky enough to get our hands on some of kates choc damour chocolates so we thought it would be fun to give you our own impressions of what her team came up withthe first thing i should say is that this product obviously isnt actually available so we dont have real packaging instead ive had to resort to using a screen grab from the tv to show the packaging designto be frank i didnt think much of the brand they came up with its quite bland and has been done many times before  and much better i much preferred yasminas  cocoa electric both in terms of the packaging design and how theyd positioned the productbut of course whats really important is how good the chocolates are so lets take a lookso all in all we have five fantastic chocolates  as good as you would find anywhere  and probably better than you would ever find on any supermarket shelf the team came up with a great balance of flavours and used some quality ingredientshad these been real the problem would have been the price at  a box its unlikely they would have been able to get into the supermarkets in the first place but any cheaper and they would have had to compromise on ingredients and the result just wouldnt have been the sameas to whether kate should have won with these chocolates well thats a tough call yasmina had a more interesting brand but used cheap ingredients to keep the price down its debatable whether anyone would have bought the chocolates more than oncei wasnt overly keen on the brand kate created for something aimed at both men and women it was overly girly and the for him for her to share strapline she came up with for choc damour is just plain wrong nobody would want to share these with anyonegreat blog im so jealous that you got to try these exclusive chocolates i agree that kates chocolates sounded a lot nicer but at the end of the day it wasnt an interview to be a chocolatier in my mind yasmina was by far the strongest candidate for the jobid rooted for kate all series i was so upset when yasminas cheap chocolate won through i didnt like the idea of kates chocolate brand ellira doesnt share chocolate but i thought the ad was hilarious and the chocolates sound ohsodelicious lucky you for trying themthanks james  ill subscribe to your blogthis batch was actually made just for us by paul young and biked over this morning if you really get into blogging about chocolate seriously youll find that the uk chocolate industry is a small and friendly community so its quite easy to get to know peopleand the best advice i can give would be to look into getting some help with reviews  or you will get fat 
first impressions arent bad an interesting looking bar of milk chocolate with a nice shine and an unusual ripple pattern to itbut as it turns out thats not necessarily a bad thing because the turkish delight in this bar is quite awful its nothing more than glucose syrup and some pectin with some artificial flavouring and beetroot for colour its horribly sweet and more liquid than solid so it just ends up coating the insides of your mouth with its nastiness i found i had to have a glass of water after each chunk just to be able to taste anything else againurgh sounds horrible the frys seems to be treated as something fairly ordinary but i think they are not actually too bad and clearly a lot better than what you have just enduredas much as i love chocolate i dont think it should be paired with turkish delight i love the traditional kind dusted with icing sugar  preferably with nuts but this is becoming harder to find these days sadlyits sad when you have low hopes and even then youre being optimisticwhat id really love to see is turkish delight covered in dark chocolate  anyone know of such a thing available in australia
i had to pause for a second when i saw that sugar is also the first ingredient on the dark chocolate its a  how can that be but cocoa butter and cocoa mass which both count towards that total are separated so it works once you taste it though  the sugar is just a little too apparent appropriate to being the first listed ingredient cutting back on it wouldnt hurt now i dont think this chocolate tastes bad but i dont see very much gain in it its another dovealike darkness without a real chocolate experienceboth chocolates do have a smooth and gentle melting though so ill keep my hopes up for the sugar frees if it was between these two id reach for the  first unless plain dark chocolates are to your tastes which i know is the true in some casesi agree  the sugar free line tastes a heck of a lot better
they reminded me of stubby little binoculars about cm long and my two little cotasters my daughter carly and her playdate juliet were keen to try them with a glass of milk straight after schooltheir verdict mmm can we have some more please  these delicate little wafer rolls were most definitely moreish  the milky sweet chocolate was naturally the first end a proud chocablogger elected to bite into and it melted away rapidly to allow a second sensation of crunching through to the delightfully crisps layers of wafer  simple scrummy and satisfying  within two minutes the packet was gone  that says it all really   the texture contrast between the smooth chocolate and the crispy wafers is just wonderful oh i do love these little thingiesi knowand its morning tea time as i write this and i should go for a mighty long power walk in seardch of more of thesethey are so yum just thinking about it i want one more just onemmmmm tastey by juliet fraseri have to agree these cookies are absolutely delicious my sister brought them home for me from some polish deli around here in new york and i was stunned how good theyre in fact i am on here typing about them and googled them to buy more lol
this bar is further proof that it is possible to get ones hands on premium quality chocolate at less than premium prices of course were not talking master chocolatier material but this milk chocolate is certainly  cut above your average and at a very reasonable pricethey look so wonderfully regal  nice to see that even a dark side devotee like yourself simon can appreciate a milk every now and theni stopped eating milk chocolate a while ago because it seemed to me that it was mainly fat but  jd gross chocolate sounds like itd be a good try however the best madagascar chocolate that ive ever had is madcasses dark chocolate i think it was the  kind the one that i tried id suggest for you to try it it has the type of flavor that no other chocolate has  true deliciousness  madecassecom is the site if you want to check it outyou guys never fail mei agree with above commentsmy favorite madagasca bar is the hotel chocolat  meneva plantation from the purist rangewhich i cant seem to find anymore a friend brought back some chocolate when she visited germany last year and this madagascar  chocolate bar was one of them  i absolutely love chocolate and this was one of the best chocolate bars i have ever eaten  i grew up on german chocolate  my oma sent me packages of chocolate at christmas and for my birthday so i know good chocolatethe only problem is  i cant the madagascar chocolate bar anywhere here in vancouver canada  i looked on the back of the package and it has the lidlcom website but you cant order the chocolatedoes anyone know if and how i can order this chocolate online  i just have to have more of itthanks so much for your helpchocoholici finally got to try it a week ago and it was wow just how i like a milk chocolate bar to be  very creamy with the taste focused on the cocoa best bar to be found at this pricethe  madagascar is the best choc i have ever tasted but lidl have stopped selling the g bars and it is now only available in their boxes of mixed percentage choccies woe is me we must campaign to get it reinstateddoes anyone know how to get hold of the manufacturer
at only  grams each theyre ideally positioned as a snack for sensible dieters not me or for children me at least some of the time so i thought id try em both together  the mint pattie only slaps me with  grams of fat whereas the coconutladen golden rough slathers another  grams onto my thighs but ive dealt with bigger boys than these two  plus i have a treadmillsadly the mint pattie was even worse  what do they say about not being able to go back  it tasted like a flattened mintie or an ultra stale marshmallow soaked in mint essence before being steam rolled and then coated as thinly as possible with a smeary oily layer of compounded chocolate  maybe its for the best that they arent generous with the chocolate  ingredients include chemical delectables such as emulsifier  gelatine food acid emulsifier  enzyme invertase with traces of wheat starch  yum yumah kath we sail in the same ship in life stopping off at old ports we used to visit to revisit old memories however like porta viata in the love boat its never the same captain stubin gopher and isaac are all retired and julie just doesnt seem to do it for me anymoreso it is with food today instead of love boat chocolate we now get mostly csi chocolate dissected analyzed and regurgitated into something that is meant to be entertaining but lacks any romance or real substance dont even get me started on low fat no fat yoghurt this is true crimeif wagon wheels and golden roughs and mint patties were sent to fantasy island for a weekend they would find themselves again rediscover their roots and come back to us with mr roarke smiling and nodding appreciatively at their miraculous transformationsighbeautifully said oliverthere appears to be a huge shortage of golden roughs at the moment cannot find them anywhere have they gone out of production i used to love mint patties sooo much bought a few lately when i have been travelling but devastated  pathetic thin no marshmellowly feel small small small  what happened product should now come with its own microscope so you can see it  however the price goes up  wont be buying anymore killed the childhood favourite nestle dont you knowwhen it aint broke dont fix it but you broke it now fix it you greedy buggersmint pattie all the way   golden rough 
i wouldnt normally consider buying this but my hunt for every day chocolates that we havent yet reviewed is becoming increasingly difficult my latest excursion to waitrose resulted in this and two other bars but upon returning home i discovered simon had already reviewed them after three years of eating chocolate for a living my memory is starting to fadei have to admit it was the bright orange wrapper that attracted my attention this timehaving said all that its still a rather tasty bar like the old jamaica version its really quite moreish and im almost ashamed to admit that i finished off this g bar on my own those fake orange pieces do actually taste quite orangey and the fake dark chocolate is overly sweet but quite ediblei wont be buying this again but thats primarily because i know i would just stuff my face and then feel bad about it for the next week if you can live with that then go buy somei love chocolatei loved it unfortunately i cant find it anywhere in midwales hence im looking online if it is cost prohibitive due to pp ill have to do without it as id eat a bar every day if i had to buy loads at a time
the block is only  grams so comparable to your runofthemill lindt but priced a bit higher the cocoa content is only   a bit light on for a dark  noir but i guess it scrapes in  and there are plenty of others out there similarthe actual breaking of a piece of is most impressive  some chocolate just wont snap even the really dark ones this does  in fact its quite solid and hard to break and makes a great sound when it does the aroma is not especially pronounced  so there are not really any hints there but on tasting  the orange kicks in and complements the chocolate very well the chocolate is rich there is no bitterness at all and the sweetness is noticeable but not objectionable for a  chocolate this is quite exceptional i was expecting more sweetness the lack of it is quite an achievement and the orange is neither too strong nor too weak like baby bears porridge its juuuuust riiiiighti kept going back for more samples while writing this this is very moreish im looking forward to racing back to foodland to get a few of the other products in the kaoka range when i get em ill report backkaoka almost reminds me of cloaca but this version sounds far nicer to eat thank you for your comments about our dark orange chocolatekaoka team
but i found them worth looking into since summer is essentially here now theyve had to spend most of their time in the refrigerator lest they turn into a hopeless peanut butterchocolate soup the milk chocolate seems a decent quality it makes up a big enough percentage to tell it isnt just here for the idea the filling is like fresh peanut butter with that oh so tempting saltiness thrown inbeing about the size of an ear of corn though still with their peanut butter cup shape its easy to lose track of how many you eat well the nutrition facts do call twentyseven one serving which sounds like a lot but thats only about fortytwo gramsnow looking at them i thought they might make nice chocolate chips so i had to test out the theory everyone agreed that they added a depth to the cookies especially with their slightly bigger for chocolate chips that is size either way you eat them im quite happy with this find and if its too hot that you think theyll all melt and stick to each other before you get home you can always rescue them by eating them all in the car after getting your groceriestime to head to trader joes  thanks for letting us know about themi love peanut butter and these are amazing  i try not to buy them too often because i just gobble them upthey sound evilly delicious  wonder if theyre available in australiasorry kath theyre only available in stores not online and trader joes only has stores in the usput me on the list of folks traveling to tjs this weekend  i find most of their products to be very good  thanks for the tip
we were accompanied by justines three year old daughter annabelle who immediately pointed to the chocolate hippopotamus on sale and said thats what id like  she then sniffed the air and said mmmm smell it mummy shes a smart kid that one because the air was filled with the heavenly scent of dark chocolate and cocoatim coowner with his wife ingrid came out for a chat when he noticed me whip the camera out and start snapping wildly  weve just won four silver medals at the royal sydney show he said proudly  interestingly threeoutoffour of those silvers were for categories where the judges did not award a gold medal for any of the chocolates in contention so they were obviously a very picky bunch  lizzys chocolate creations has been operating for over twenty five years using belgian chocolate in all of their handmade creations that are lovingly made at the back of the shopwe took some back to justine and annabelles for tasting  annabelle was sent off for an afternoon sleep with the promise of being allowed to try her milk chocolate hippo upon awakening  with the room a tiny bit quieter justine and i geared up to taste these little beautiesthe lemon tart truffle was first my only tasting rule being to start with the lightest and end with the darkest  this tastes like lemon meringue cheesecake said justine and i agreed  very fine white chocolate with an almost liquid cream centre flavoured with lemon zest  superbthe milk chocolate truffle earl grey tea was next  the tea flavour came through strongly enough to be appreciated but subtlely enough to pair up perfectly with the milk chocolate these are definitely my cup of tea justine said it makes you suck the gaps between your teeth to get more ill be going back to buy some of these me tooas with the rose the lavender infusion also was relatively odourless and took a bit longer to make its presence felt on the palate justine was relieved this is like the lovely oldfashioned lavender thats growing in my garden not the fake chemical stuff they use in loo spray  i didnt notice the floral at first just the smooth dark chocolate until the lavender started to emerge as the truffle filling melted on my tongue  delicately delightfultim slipped in a couple of dark truffle chilli bombs as a bonus and a clever way to pack a punch at the end  justine didnt agree this is pain chilli not nice chilli chocolates supposed to be fun not a horrible surprise that kicks you in the guts  i liked it  it got progressively hotter until it took over the dark chocolate and left a pleasant tingling  remind me not to use too much chilli if i ever cook justine a currythese are all gold medal contenders in my opinionactually i think you did stop at a crack house disguised at a chocolatier  i would be in serious trouble if this place were any closer to miami   sounds absolutely amazingthe chili bombs sound intriguing  do they sell in the ussounds like a place ill need to visit soon  could be a nice girly outing with mum a fellow chocoholic  did you notice any cafes nearby that sell good coffee to go with it or do they have coffee there as wellthey have coffee there christine otherwise in the street parallel whose name escapes me cos im a bogan from flemington had a really great cafe with topnotch coffeebrilliant  thanks kathive never tried turkish delight it sounds very interestingit is  if you like floral flavours such as rose lemon myrtle and violet you will love itkaththat does sound interesting im not sure ive ever had floral flavoursi want to try thatthese are the greatest chocs ever and we miss them terribly  they used to be our local and we made the mistake of moving away  try the ganache hearts  we had them on our wedding cake and they are divine  a fabulous shop and lots of yummy things to try  we still get our fix  just not as regularlyi only discovered lizzys relatively recently strange and annoying as my grandmother lives just around the corner and the family visited her at least annually but im extremely glad i did the whole store has a warm personal atmostphere that actually felt real not manufactured even though the store was fairly busy when my girlfriend and i went in the staff still took the time to make careful recommendations and to answer all my questions about the stores history etc i wish i could remember what i tried there but it was over a year ago now  trip to melbourne coming up soon though
its been a short while since i tackled anything a bit wacky and a quick rummage through the inbox unearthed this little gem  a french dark chocolate bar  cocoa containing espelette chilli pepper and grapefruitas it turned out i wasnt far wrong an initial zingy citrus moment as your taste buds encounter the lumps with grapefruit is very closely followed by sweet chocolate hot on the heels of the chocolate and yes the pun was intended comes a wave of deep warming chilli which persists right until youve nibbled the last of the grapefruit lumps the finish is all grapefruit and chilli with the citrus flavour cleansing the palate as the chilli dies downas far as the chocolate goes its fairly unremarkable stuff a very average medium strength dark chocolate the addition of the chilli and grapefruit make it more interesting but aside from it being the only time ive had a grapefruitchocolate combination it wouldnt be something id buy againafter all painting racing stripes on a donkey and giving it a pair of sunglasses doesnt make it a better donkey does itgreat closing line simon pity about the chocolate i agree with shady  still as a very silly person i couldnt help but thinking that anything called pamplemousse would be worth a tryoh i dont know  we all know red cars go faster and red with racing stripes even faster again 
the dark chocolate here is a  cocoa solids  par for the course for this kind of bar its quite pleasant not too sweet and not bitter at all but its not very thickmost of the bar is taken up by the ginger truffle filling which is soft smooth and sweet there is a good ginger flavour but there are no actual pieces of ginger visible and i thought it could have done with being just a little bit strongeras a quick snack i certainly enjoyed this little bar but i really felt it could be improved no end if the chocolate were that little bit thicker and if it had some nice chunks of crystalised ginger buried inside that sweet truffleyou are dead right  chocolate and ginger really do make an excellent combination
firstly the original torino  classic swiss milk chocolate with a hazelnut truffle centre  this is delectably creamy and the hazelnut filling sings like a nightingale to the milky smooth chocolate that generously envelops it as they both dissolve seductively in the mouth lingering like lovers putting off having to go their separate wayson a more mundane and less romantic level enjoying torino with a nice and hot cup of freshly ground coffee makes the experience even better as the heat enhances the flavours even more and made me reach for another square then another then how about a whole row and a second row whoops its all gone  deliciously dangerously easy to eat in one sittingthe torino noir is a much newer product and one that shows some respect for the increasingly large band of dark side devotees who also like some interest inside the chocolate  anything is better when encased in dark chocolate is my general beliefagain the chocolate  whose percentage of cocoa solids is not listed in the ingredients panel  is sensuously creamy and instantly melts in the mouth  it is strong and sweet so im guessing its around fifty or sixty percent cocoa content  surprisingly it totally dominates the truffle centre so that only a hint of hazelnut flavour emerges and even so only every now and then before disappearing into the darkness  yep the key flavour is ubervelvety dark chocolate with what  if clueless and blindfolded  id assume was a lindor balllike filling inside  this is not necessarily a bad thing  faint detections and hints are sometimes what drives serious chocaholics on and gets them up in the mornings  either way torino noir tastes decadently divinedefinitely one to look for next time im shopping hopefully coles has it although the shelves are even more full of their own brands now
every now and again you have to get a pleasant surprise and yesterday was one of those daysthe lady of the house likes to make snide remarks about the chocolate obsession but she also finds new and different things when out shopping and brings them home then has a go at me when i have a rush of enthusiasm and whip out the camera for the chocolate what were you thinkingyesterday she brought home this cocoa belgian dark  which immediately put her in the good books seeing as im a pal of darth vader dark side ok i suppose it is getting a bit lame this is a  cocoa solids block  so not a dark as some but dark enoughweve had a number of reviews here of chocolates made for large stores in australia the uk and the usa in most cases they have been pretty ordinary some have been terrible so i prepared myself to be disappointed and set the pack aside  for laterwell later arrived after an hour or so it was time to give it a try weak willedfirst impression on opening the pack was a rich dark almost earthy aroma a good start next breaking off a piece this chocolate is quite thick the pieces are a good size and its pretty solid  so the pieces break with a nice very satisfying snap and the taste its good very good the texture is excellent  fine a good slow melt lots of complex flavours i promptly ate a couple of rows and a couple more todayall in all a very pleasant surprise for a megamart ownbrand makes note to go buy morei had to laugh when i read the start of this review i was once accused of taking all the fun out of chocolate by having to take photos of it prior to consumptionme too simon  theres always a couple of overlydramatic sighs some eyerolling and then a whine of havent you finished photographing it yetashleigh im glad that you liked this i saw it and to my shame immediately wrote it off as being as bad as the woolworths select chocolate  nice to see that sometimes the big house brands can provide something decent  does it come in any other flavourssimon  kath  ive been accused of exactly the same oh do you have to do that cant we just open it on being told no much eye rolling sighing shaking of heads by all of them even the damn cats seem to be in on the acti get the same whineit takes like two minutes at most for photos and then the consuming of chocolate can begin sometimes i break a piece off the end hand that over and then slide the chocolate back into the wrapper for the photosi didnt mind the fruit  nut version of this one nice surprisejames  find more like thisgo a bit higher in cocoa there are some really good  to  chocs out there and in spite of being high in cocoa you dont get your socks blown off like you might sometimes expectdont whatever you do source anything with the dreaded vegetable fat in it thats just sacrilege and yukmake sure what you buy gets tasted by somebody who likes things a bit more complex than dairy milk from that well known megamakeravoid harsh flavours and strange flavours except see belowif looking for something a bit offbeat then go for unusual flavours due to the original of the cocoa rather than additives but make sure you have a suitable name as a warning to the consumerstrange  standout  funky packaging adds interest just make sure the contents matchtake tasting notes and check now and again to make sure its all still what you thought you have sourceduse more than one taster send me a sample and ill check it out for youand steer clear of whoever makes the woolworths select stuff which im afraid to say is pretty ordinary i know you are the same company im very familiar with woolies no the select is actually pretty awful those of us in oz who have tried it wont ever touch it againabove all remember  life is too short to eat bad food  drink bad wine and this applies to chocolate sell a good product and you get loyalty for life sell a bad product and you have an enemy for life who will never trust you again and doubly so with chocolate you only get one chance with joe public if the chocolate is crap and you change the supplier tough youve lost em foreveroh one more thing these are personal preferences to read into them what you willchocolates with nuts in read some of my other reviews here nuts need to be big lots of them and toastycrunchy small pieces are horrible so are not enough there are some fantastic polish chocolates with nuts inand my favourite  ginger chocolate it needs to be dark  preferably about  and it needs to have plenty of big chunks of crystallised ginger there are some good examples out there and some awful australian ginger is good we should exploit it again read my reviews of ginger choc i bang on about what makes a good ginger choccy youll get the message soon enough i am a converted dark fan once upon a time it was too rich for me but now i prefer it wondering if you can help me how do i know how much cocoa butter is in the chocolate i am looking for a belgian chocolate to use in a chocolate fountain i bought for a christmas gift i live in a small town so there is no such place as a speciality chocolate shop im considering including a few blocks of this chocolate in the gift but i want to be sure there cocoa butter is high enough so no dreaded vegetable oil needs to be added thanks in advancethen check the nutrition panel and check the amount of fat present for example suppose i have  cocoa solids and it is  fat you might have to look in the amount per  grams column which gives percentage automatically then you have your answerthe reason for checking the ingredients list is only to check out whats in it if you want to avoid vegetable oils and fats they have to be listed if you find something with those in then put it back and choose another by definition if there is fat there and it only came from one source it must be cocoa butterthe cocoa belgian chocolate is somewhat delcicious and accordingly my wife bought several gm blocks of fruit  nut and milk when she weighed them for the fudge recipe she was making we found every block weighed in at approximately gm mmmm might have to check cadbury chocolate blocks next timethe manufacture information on the latest block of belgian chocolate says packed in china from belgian chocolate for big w i seem to recall as recent as  months ago it used to say made in belgium not real sure what the latest information means it might be belgian chocolate but is it still made in belgiumkevin  thats a shame i have not tried this recently i was recently in a big w store and saw huge jumbo packs of these i didnt check the label i was looking for other thingspersonally id be wary of packed in china shame on mr big w for trying to suck the cost down a smidgin moreit is back on the shelves in big w in another dark packaging and looks like they have gone back to their original recipe but still ex chinatry the kmart one which according to the wrapper is made in belgium
ive had the chance to try a lot of amazing chocolates but i was still impressed by this one to start off i liked its design the shadowy tree painting against the shiny black was the perfect image to begin my chocolate ritual with slowly open up the box slide the precious gold out carefully fold back the foil delicately snap off one of the end columns and snap off one piece reveling in the gorgeous break then take the small pieces turn it around examine its pretty color and shape inhale its aromathis one is supposed to taste of apricot and marshmallow the two flavors come in that order a part of the strong chocolate taste that mingles with their warm summery kind of sweetness speaking of sweetness its pretty sweet for a dark chocolate but in such a nice way it isnt sugary or sickly at all so i find this a good thing and i imagine so will most other people the way it melts paired with this is just divineif you really love your friends and are willing to spend nine dollars on them this would be a standout gift with quality theyll appreciate and enjoy or you may just find yourself hoarding it all for which this bar is also fabulousthis one sounds the best of all the amano bars youve reviewed i especially love the design of the pack very swish lookingquin that is what i meant to say but i guess the way i worded it was misleading thanks for the correction anyway though
and it thankfully tastes that way as well  the pellicle layer between the soft milky chocolate feels fine and delicately crispy not cheap and grainy like some sugar coatings and effortlessly releases a fine and sweet pear liqueur  this is a delicious way to feature three different but complementary tastes  milk crunch and liqueur  and would be a fine introduction to liqueur chocolates for those who are nervous andor dont enjoy especially strong alcohol tastesthe grappa chocolate block is dark and filled with an italian spirit that is made from the grapes left after winemaking  it is a much stronger more pungent flavoured alcohol filling that can make fainterhearted tasters cough  not this one though  the dark chocolate is especially creamy to taste and very soon the strong spirit flows out without an intervening pellicle crust  interestingly it is the grappa that lingers afterwards and not the dark chocolate even though whilst eating it the tastes are intertwined  i really enjoyed this one also but could only manage half the block or four squares totaling fifty grams  its not too often that such a thing happensas founder camille bloch famously said you dont share the chocolate you share the pleasure in it  i like that and will continue to use it as the reason why my family often wonder why there are no leftovers after my tasting sessionsi liked the description of the brandy filled chocolate i will have to consider buying some the next time im at a specialty food shop or ordering from amazoncom i was sad to read that it only got  start on amazon but i like to decide on something for myself and your posting has be intriguedthanksone star on amazon hmm surely that must be from someone who isnt into liqueur chocolates because the grappa is a classic
made from half  milk chocolate and half white chocolate the front of the slab is covered in naturally coloured graffiti that looks amazingthe white chocolate has a subtle fruit flavour to it and the whole slab has raisins pistachios and cherries buried inside the result is something thats fruity creamy and incredibly moreish it actually tastes like the tutti fruitti ice creams i remember as a child its just divinei had planned to just take a few bites from this oversized hunk of yumminess and save the rest to share with friends and get their opinion unfortunately before i realised what i was doing half the slab had disappeared i know not where honesti did manage to save some to share with friends at a barbecue but everyone who tried it had the same problem i didnt get the kind of feedback i was hoping for either  but thats primarily because it had been completely scoffed before anyone had a chance to form an opinionneedless to say this is a delicious summery and fruity slab thats made for sharing just dont expect it to last longbeautiful  nice for weddings maybe  for the wedding party chocoholicsthat looks like a work of art albeit a delicious onei want onei want one too and the caramellow and the rocky road and the triple chocolate their slabs look fantastic
last year i investigated a couple of his products but i also wanted to try some of his prize winning chocolates so i bought a handful to see what all the fuss was aboutthe first one i sampled was the thyme  scottish heather honey and the moment my teeth cracked the dark toscano chocolate shell i found myself breathing in the sweet smell of the honeythe centre continued to deliver that rich sweetness in combination with the buttery cocoa flavours to the very last leaving a lingering hint of the honey on my palate delightfulnext up was a caramel simple as that  a salted caramel cupmy final choice had to be williams multiaward winning chuao chocolatethis little beauty has garnered a multitude of plaudits from chocolate tasters all over the world so i knew i was in for a treat and what a treat it wasmade using venezuelan cocoa chuao is the name of a village in the region now reportedly being dveloped into a tourist attraction and is reputed to be some of the finest cocoa in the worldtheres no doubting the pedigree of this chocolate as you bite down the balance between flavour and texture is sublime hugely chocolatey and yet amazingly light and delicate at the same time the cocoa flavours are as near to perfect as you could wish for in the mouth this chocolate delivers a wonderfully deep complex set of flavours without once becoming even slightly heavy or cloying i didnt realise it was possible to find cocoa with such richness of flavour and such light body try one of these and you can see how it has amassed so many awards truly top notch confectioneryits fairly obvious from the stack of awards that they have amassed that the curleys are at the top of their game anyone serious about top quality chocolate has to try some of their creations and i am glad to report that they do live up to all of the hype a mustdo for any chocolate fiendtoojealoustotypeanythingprofoundi love this blog  thank god other people care as much about chocolate as i do this particular post was a ray of sunshine in an otherwise terrible day at work  so i ordered myself some of the chocolates to cheer myself up its a bit more expensive than the usual dairy milk but its going to be worth the waitchristine im planning on reviewing the mornington peninsula stuff i tried their wonderful samples during the melt day that was part of the recent melbourne food and wine festival and am longing for moreim eating a william curley sea salt caramel bar at the moment its bloody lovely i have always been more a fan of milk chocolate i know i know but its just a preference but this dark chocolate is delicious not a hint of bitterness which is what usually puts me off and the caramel is superb and i dont think im going to be able to look at a bar of cadburys caramel in quite the same way ever againim looking at the salted caramel cup and i dont think that is a corn stalk on it it sure looks like a cocoa pod anyone else agreeinteresting but unattainable im far more interested in the kg tin of quality street chocolates sitting right beside my left elbowits definitely a cocoa pod its too fat to be corn and besides corn would be sort of random on a caramel wouldnt it
eldest son has been berating me for converting him to the dark side he doesnt much like milk chocolate any more and at age  hes pretty unimpressed that something he used to enjoy is not seen as so flash any more of course its all my fault but whats the big deal he likes dark chocolate and there is not exactly a shortage of thatdemonstrating that hes not completely serious in blaming me for his ills he came home from an afterschool trip to the supermarket proudly bearing a block of nestle club classic peppermint cream  a gift for me he says though i suspect a gift for us both is more like itgiven his involvement and that he rushed to open the pack before i could photograph it i think it appropriate that he describe this feast for the senses in his own words so here goesthe club classic peppermint cream combines a rich dark chocolate and a very strong taste of peppermint  just smelling it is enough to tell it contains peppermint  or maybe fake peppermint the ingredients contain no mention of peppermint at all the chocolate is  and there is also sugar cocoa mass butter oil cocoa butter emulsifiers glucose syrup  flavours and coloursthe appearance is a little disturbing as the chocolate looks fine on the outside but when you split a piece open from what appears to be a normal block of chocolate alien blood appearsthe peppermint comes out in a big sticky green pool and doesnt look very appetising but somehow even without containing any peppermint it tastes greatpeppermint chocolate seems to be one of those love  hate things i quite like it as does oldest son so we close our eyes ignore the alien blood and think this is pretty good toning down the green colour would make it even betteri have to give this chocolate a tryah yes my motto for dark chocolate and peppermint one of my favourite flavour combinations btw is if its green it should never be seen  toxic snot does not belong inside chocolatelooks good  i dont understand why we never get any great looking candy in ustrust you to find the radioactive looking chocolate again ive tried this and have to say i prefer the cadbury milk chocolate peppermint block if i have to eat dark choc and peppermint i prefer the frys peppermint bar the chocolate there is not as thick for me it seems to make a difference and of course the peppermint is a more solid form in the frys  your sons review was excellent im rambling ill leave nowfrys  yes  i havent been able to find that in years unless i pay throughthenose for it at a uk imported sweets shop sighate club just nowoooo i must say all peppermint choc lovers must try it im quite surprise of the oozing peppermint when i broke the piecelolss i think ill go finish up the whole bar d d
that amano would choose to make milk chocolate isnt surprising giving their approachable sophistication but the  content of both of these is lower than many other quality chocolatiers usually go for after spending so much effort perfecting the cacao they must want it to get at least a certain amount of say in the final productthe ocumare from venezuela seems to have more of a cinnamon flavor and a soothing kind of taste theres another flavor that at first i only picked up on at the end its also stronger when you chew the chocolate caramel maybeim really not quite talented enough to choose a favorite i can taste the difference though its even more vast if you go back and forth between the two without allowing time in between to forget each ones taste what i can say is that their fullbodied tastes are uniquely delicious and im finding that amanos weakening my will concerning moderationgreat review ill have to try amano milk chocolate myself you should check out some of the chocolate reviews on cocoaheavencom tootheese are two wonderful bars but i think that if they add some cacao mass itll be better
having said that this morning i was absolutely famished after going for a run hanging out the weeks washing sweeping up leaves walking the dog cleaning out the kitchen and decluttering my desk so hungry that even the studiouslyignored kitkat chunky cookies  cream looked like an attractive prospect for morning teawell ram my face into a brick wall and call me amy winehouse because this is absolutely scrumptioustime to look at the ingredients  they unfortunately do not make comforting reading because this one bar gives out  grams of fat of which  grams is saturated  or roughly a third of your daily fat allowance in an easilyforgotten match up with your cup of tea  hmmm fruit for lunch and then salad for dinner for me today then  despite these dreary facts its a nice bar for those times youre feeling like something naughty but noshablesounds scrumptious the way youve written about it kath please say we can get these in the ukyou should start a campaign shady apparently though it is japan that leads the world in terms of the sheer number and creativity in their kitkat fillings and flavoursthe japanese do everything well they did invent origami after alland thats enough to confuddle anybodys brain bring them to england
pop a few of these in your mouth an the dark bittersweet coating starts to melt teasing the palate with rich tangy cocoa flavours bite down on the pieces and the slightly crunchy cocoa nibs start to release their softer nuttier more rounded flavours the nibs are bursting with natural cocoa flavour and are quite frankly irresistible whether you leave them in your mouth to let the coating melt or just chew away at them these little nibs are a delight for the palatei have yet to sample a chocolat factory product which didnt make me smile and set my mouth watering theyre creating some very interesting products and im sure it wont be too long before they stop being a well kept secret and go globalim not sure which pocket id slip the tube into though might be a case of have you been to chocolat factory or are you just pleased to see meyou are evil going through that heavenly discription and then telling me i cant have it in the ukwipes drool from the keyboardwhat a great idea  apart from yep im really pleased to see you jokes theyll also be protected from melting  plus the packaging looks gorgeouswhat a great idea  perfect for carrying in the purse for a small chocolate fix on the go  i want oneoooh i love cocoa nibs must be time for me to make another visit to haighs factory here in adelaidechocolates from chocolat factory are great in design but chocolate itself  is regular chocolateyou can have better chocolate from a real chocolatiergreetings from spain
when chocablog reader kathy sent us that email i sent both kath and ashleigh out to find it luckily they both came up trumps so its time for another one of our almost legendary twoforone reviewsi have to admit when i found this was a milk chocolate i was a bit underwhelmed surely butterscotch would work better with a dark after all everything works better with dark chocolatewhen we open the pack here we find a nicely presented chocolate just like all the others we expect from green  blacks the aroma is not especially strong  again much as id expect from a milk chocolate busting it apart the little pieces of yellow cruchy stuff are apparent though still giving no hint of what is to comeon trying itoh wow this really is something its a crunching choccy dont suck on it or let it melt  crunch it up and when you do youll go back for more and more caramel sugar honey  yes it has them all and something else i cant really define just wow factori feel a dose of the austin powers coming on this is clearly something concocted in the evil labs of dr evil designed to make me into that other famous character fat btard this is wicked stuff i dare you to stop eating it when you start i fully understand and sympathise with our reader who requested the review calling out it is calling now think i need to go back and check to see if its got any worse bet it hasnthands being draaaaggggeeedddddd away from keyboardkaths reviewi am a very bad person  really bad  i bought this block at the supermarket saying to love chunks and sapphire oooh this is new ill get it and share it with you before writing the reviewsorry  i didnt  i got it home let it sit there by the bowl of oranges and waited for sapphire to go to school and love chunks to cycle into the weather bureau before taking the required photographs of itthen i unpeeled the wrapper took another photo and tasted a couple of squares  at first i could barely detect any butterscotch  there was definitely some lovely crunchy bits in it but they could have been nibs for all i could tellso i popped in another couple of squares chewing this time with much more concentration and attention  ah yes a nice burntsugar butterscotch taste but thankfully not as sickly as some  maybe thats because the milk chocolate has a fairly generous amount of cocoa   i wasnt entirely sure of the reason so tried some more  nope they disappeared into my cavernous mouth far too quickly i needed to taste a few more but much more slowly to let the chocolate melt invitingly on my tongue then smear itself all over my eager taste buds before allowing me to play with the shards of butterscotch teasingly lingering at the endwhoops i must have zoned out a bit because i found myself munching away far too avidly for any serious taste sensation meditation to be done  i reached for a few more squares then another row finally the last one and a few guilty licks of my finger to press onto the wrapper to collect any stray crumbs and oh dear none left for my daughter or hopefully very understanding and forgivingn husbandtoo brilliantly delicious too moreish too naughty  a hundred grams a schmundred grams  too easy to inhale for a greedy guts like myselffuture note to self  buy three blocks next time so we all get to try some  now look here this is so unfair i only just started my slimfast today this sounds absolutely divine kath  your review was verging on xrated gi know   chocolate is so much more than mere brown squaresexactly i dont think that st block of mine lasted the night i resisted and then devoured the smegger in one eveningthanks for reviewing the little beggar its nice to see the addictive qualities of this stuff verifiedoh im going to have to go for such long walks my local woolies has a whole lot of gb choccies there milk dark super dark dark n orange white and the infamous butterscotchto add to the unfairness i buckled and am now as slowly as i can devouring a roast almond lindt block and i nommed through half of that and an extra creamy block in one nightits a conspiracy a conspiracy i tells yai love this chocolate i am so glad woolworths have ramped up their range on this brandi absolutely love this but it doesnt love me o my body seems to react badly to milk powders in chocolate so i have to stick to dairy milk etc now butterscotch gb is so nice thoughkathy thats why i have a treadmill ive only tried some of the dark varieties of gb so far but this does sound quite tasty ive seen it about and might just pick up a block today along with the cherry one which has been calling my namechristine you wont regret it believe mehopefully cadbury dont put this product in a box shrink the size and add vegetable fat even if it would be organic vegetable fat
the box says that mate has been held as the drink of the gods that sounds familiar maybe it makes perfect sense to pair it with chocolate now theres something about mate that lends itself to adding other flavors i recently had some vanilla nut mate and discovered the twist of adding gentler flavors to its strengthanother great thing about yerba mate in general is that it never gets bitter so they recommend letting it brew for five to ten minutes after leaving it for nine minutes it was a beautiful caramel color right away though i could taste that dreaded leaf stevia sure enough its listed as part of the blend why oh why couldnt they just let anyone who wants it add it in themselves ignoring the stevia we also have nutmeg cinnamon and cloves giving it a nice warm spiced aroma that carries into the taste as well the chocolate blends in with a rather tender flavor in about the latter half of the taste its still a different kind of tea being so strong but adding other ingredients helps suit it to more palatesits also common to drink it with as they put it your favorite milk and sweetener for me thats almond beverage and just a touch of cane sugar the almond can influence flavor but i dont really notice its taste anymore so no worries about that despite drinking tea plain all the time i actually like this one better like this partially because the stevia taste is all but gone besides that it becomes more of a drink it stays clear while flavorful this is where you can see what they mean by putting latte in the namehow can one speak ill of stevia while praising vulgar cinnamon
as you can see from the photo the bar is beautifully moulded but also very hard to break evenly i just chose to take this as a sign that the bar was all meant for meim happy to see another raw chocolate maker doing such a good job and very happy to see that we have yet another british company producing top notch products if you like raw chocolate try roar chocolatecomments are closed
im often wary of hersheys chocolate and i have to say the name of this particular bar didnt fill me with hope for the quality of the contents or say much about the rest of their presumably notsogoodbar range my expectations werent raised much when i opened the plastic wrapper to reveal this very ordinary looking very thin bar of milk chocolatebut then i turned the bar over and was greeted by a sight that was just nuts literallyi dont think ive ever seen so many peanuts in one placeim really surprised that a nonchocolate product like this popped up here the previous version of the bar wasnt quite so burnt nut tasting and definitely filling i do appreciate that they pack it with so many nuts theyve really started skimping on the nuts in their milk chocolate and almonds bar its interesting to hear the perspective of someone who never tried the originalim interested as to why youre surprised we reviewed itdom  as i said  just because its not really chocolate i got the impression you folks didnt review candy items i was probably wrongobviously theres a vast difference between a hersheys candy bar and a proper chocolate like a valrhona or an amano but my personal view is that we should cover the entire spectrum without being overly judgmentalmy favorite is the hersheys special dark pieces dark chocolatei have been buying hershey bars and mr goodbars since the seventies in the past few years hershey chocolate has downsized the giant bars so much i no longer purchased anything but mr goodbar which weighed in at over  oz  recently they downsized their last so called giant mr goodbar to match the others  this concludes any future purchase of any hershey large bars ill buy bars made over in the uk from now onthey still hold true the original old fashioned thick size barshey hershey chocolate company dont think were stupid raise the price if you need todont cut down on your productingredients list is not accurate they are corrected listed as follows  milk chocolate sugar cocoa butter chocolate nonfat milk milk fat soy lecithin salt pgpr emulsifier vanillin artificial flavor peanuts
i have to admit the packaging does get off to a good start with nice bright colours and the silver bands give an impression of something pretty specialthis is a dark chocolate with hazelnuts any chocolate with hazelnuts can be good or bad and most of those i come across easily here are a light or milk chocolate which is a bit on the boring side so this one seemed like a promising and interesting change its still easy to mess up a chocolate with nuts in because it they are not fresh and crunchy the result is pretty horribleopening the pack produced a heck of a surprisethe top of the block is like the top of so many  nice and shiny some nice patterns in nothing offensive at all not interesting either the back though  thats interesting this chocolate says it has nuts in and from the back  does it have nuts  ive never seen anything like it there are a lot of nuts jammed in here it almost looks like the nuts have been pushed in when the chocolate was poured checking the pack  nuts are  of the total weight it showsand the chocolate is a  it showsit means bitter indeed however i dont really know whythis chocolate is even cheaper in poland  it does not even cost   i use krakowska gorzka plain without hazelnuts for cookingregards from polandi love them they should be available in any polish store in the usa
it was morning tea time so i rejected my usual choice of coffee to follow the instructions on how to make a chau colat hot chocolate  details about this product are sketchy other than its made by chocdecor who specialise in creating d characters and painting them in chocolate  theres no mention of the cocoa content but when opened it smelled like strong bittersweet chocolate consisting of approximately  cocoa solids  trouble is the chocolate spoon looked too pretty to submerge in hot milkin the interests of chocablog however i swallowed my misgivings and hopefully soon some melted hot chocolate and ploughed on  i liked that their instructions suggested to microwave the milk as i wasnt too keen on having to get out saucepan and muck around and office workers would be even less inclined to do so  when the milk was hot enough the spoon was swirled through  it started melting into little grainy pieces at first and every now and then ill admit to taking the spoon out and giving the melted remains a lick or twothe end result  achieved in less than a minute  was a nottoostrong hot chocolate that didnt need any sugar added  i left the stick in the cup to keep the chocolate blobs from sinking to the bottom and took my first sipsvery nice and not too creamy or sickly  it is still sweet but acceptably so with a slightly coffeetinged bitter flavour that suggests good quality dark chocolate is present  a cup of this was very satisfying and kept me going until lunchtime  this would also be very nice in the evening when youre snuggled up on the sofa in front of a good dvdhi kathnice review  looks like we gave you a special sample without all of the relevant info chau colat is made by belfine in belgium and contains  cocoa in the dark chocolate all the correct ingredients for sofas and dvds in melbourne in winterah so my guess of  cocoa solids wasnt too far off the mark 
as you can see this bar has all the classic hallmarks of top quality chocolate its glossy with a deep reddish brown hue the scent of it is all top end cocoa notes citrussy and slightly woody with undercurrents of richer flavours to come on the palate its a slightly different story the chocolate is very quick to melt beginning with a slight bittersweet note which is followed by a wave of dark cocoa flavour it has an excellent mouthfeel and delivers lots of rich full flavour without ever becoming heavy or cloying in any way at the finish it remains light on the palate but full of taste  in other words classic posh chocolateand who are these academy of chocolate eggheads anywayfrm where i get this choclate
at the recent melbourne food and wine festival was a day called wicked in which the melt chocolate hall was my very first  and most important  port of callamongst the divine range of chocolates on offer to taste talk about purchase and admire was a range that was almost hiding amongst bottles of spanish olive oil and  yearold balsamic vinegars  we had a taste of the vinegar first which the proprietor of oliveria morri said is drunk with hot water in japan and drizzled over breads salads meats and fish by aussie enthusiasts  love chunks commented that it was fine enough to drink on its ownhowever it was the three handmade chocolate flavours that were next to the deli items that intrigued me enough to buy a boxthe first one was the balsamico blance de espana green dot on top which combines dark chocolate virgin olive oil and muscatel dessert wine grapesthe second yellow dot on top was the limon siciliana blending macerated organic sicilian lemons that have been pressed together with ligurian olives into an extravirgin olive oil and white balsamic vinegarthe third gold was fig smyrna presenting figs olive oil and balsamic vinegar in dark chocolatethe gentle scent of olive oil was present when they were cut open and the balsamico tasted first of olive then the balsamic followed by the driedapricot chewiness and sweetness of the muscatel grapes inside  on the bottom half of the chocolate was a ganache of  dark and crme fraiche that partnered up with the subtleness of the olive oil to perfectionlastly the fig smyrna  this was a delicious combination of dried figs olive oil vinegar and ganache that despite the oddness of the ingredients made the chocolate taste smooth sweet creamy and tangy all at the same time  the figs were hard to detect as anything other than a chewy fruit but they contributed a dusky and earthy flavour as the ganache quickly melted away on the tonguei never thought that olive oil balsamic vinegar and chocolate could be combined so brilliantly and was even more intrigued to hear morri say that the new flavours of sun dried tomato and anchovy were being created and will be available to try soon  stay tunedyou do release there is no such thing as white balsamic vinegar its like white chocolate  a travestythese sound interesting but i dont know how the anchovy creation will go yikesoh ok ashleigh christine i confess to feeling a tad nervous about the anchovy one as well but puffs out chest and gazes into the distance i will do it for chocablogsee now youre headed into my sort of territory anchovy indeedi would like to purchase some white balsamic can you let me know how i can do this
beneath its silver foil the chocolate is nearly as dark as the black outer box with a finelined pattern on each of the dozen piecesa glance at the ingredients which are very helpfully in eight languages since english us never lists these percentages shows that there is  of banana pulp in here so its a real and fresh taste not artificial its also the perfect part of the flavor probably split evenly with the chocolate though your focus goes more to the banana it maintains its strength throughout im kind of getting the idea that this wouldnt be my absolute favorite chocolate on its own its hard to isolate it and it is nice and smooth but im wondering if id find it too bland of course thats only a conjecture its a perfect partner to the banana so my guess is hopefully wrongmy companions for the tasting dubbed it a good dessert chocolate which is an apt name its dessert sweetness is of the fruit kind that a real banana has coming across in a calm symbiosis with the dark chocolate that you can slowly enjoy after a mealbanana and chocolate are a great combinationi just like to cut banana into long halves and pour warmmelted dark chocolate overnothing moresimple but tastes greatyoure right deanna  it is an unusual combination in a chocolate bar id love to see something like that here in australia  i wonder though if it might work better with a more milky chocolate insteadid love to see it in oz as well sounds perfect absolutely drooling over the lovely photo you have of it herei second what kath said banana and chocolate is a rarity  probably because the banana tends to either be an artificial and therefore nasty flavour or just that it is so dominant and consequently marches all over whatever chocolate its paired withl found this  valor chocolate but without banana in my country todayits really greatquite mild taste for  dark with a kind of coffee notesdelicious
i was sent what i thought were four bars but each wallet turned out to have three minibars insideof the four this was the only milk chocolate bar so it seemed to make sense to attack it first the puffed grains in question seem to be made up from six different cereals and sat in a layer along the bottom of each bar instead of sugar this chocolate was sweetened with evaporated cane juice which was certainly still sweet but in a much softer waythe puffed grains add a subtle cereal flavour which sits well with the slightly darker sweetness which is inherent in the chocolate the cocoa flavours arent particularly strong and they tend to come and go in waves with the sweetness of the cane juice only really becoming dominant towards the finish this is definitely sweet chocolate but the choice of something other than refined sugar has resulted in a much more enjoyable kind of sweetnessnext up was the  dark chocolate this was obviously the house dark chocolate so it was a logical choice to sample this in its unadulterated form the smell of it put me in mind of some of the raw chocolate products weve reviewed in the past but on the palate it was a completely different story popping a square into my mouth i was surprised at how dominant the sweetness of the cane juice was  again it was the first thing i tasted but it quickly gave way to subtle dark chocolate flavours a quick reread of the packaging and there was the answer  semisweet chocolate for me the sweetness seemed to detract from the chocolate flavours a little  i found myself wishing for more chocolate and less sugarhaving enjoyed camayas toasted coconut slab finding this coconut bar in my parcel was a very pleasant and welcome surprise cracking the minislab into four released a wave of coconut aromas which had me licking my lips in anticipation the coconut in this bar is in tiny fragments and so it delivers its flavours very quickly i found myself enjoying this one more than i had the pure dark bar as the natural flavour of the coconut balanced the sweetness of the chocolate and provided a nuttier more natural counterpoint this was a good pairing in terms of flavour balancemy final sample bar was a cherry and vanilla combination unlike its predecessor i didnt catch a huge whoosh of cherry scents as i opened the package but there was a subtle hint of fruit there when i tasted it the cherry flavours built slowly as the chocolate melted delivering that slightly bitter fruit flavour which blended really well with the chocolate taking the top end off the sweetness and providing a well balanced combination of chocolate and fruit of the four bars i found this to be the one that allowed most of the chocolate flavour to come through and i think that was primarily due to the bitterness of the cherry pieces countering the sweetness inherent in seeds of changes choice of chocolate recipemy overall impression of these bars is that there is indeed a big difference between american and european palates this chocolate is much sweeter than its british counterpart and for me that only tends to detract from the crux of the matter  the cocoa flavours having said that i did enjoy the coconut and cherry bars mainly because the added ingredients balanced out the flavours it was fascinating to taste products developed for the usa after i had tasted their british equivalents and it really brought home the differences between the continents in terms of consumer tastescoconut and cherry are two of my favorite flavors so i will probably try those first  are they available in stores or just on linehi pamthey are available online and at whole foods marketsdoes soc still do rose chocolateand lavender choc for sale oline i tasted them both years agowow but cannot find to buy anywherei live in lanarkshirescotland
thus when their sweet surrender choc hazelnut flavoured mousse and crme caramel appeared a couple of months ago i studiously ignored themand it appears that most of australia  once bitten twice shy  did exactly the same  until now when they are on sale at half price and were in my shopping trolley before i could say dammit these new varieties only have nine biscuits per pack instead of the eleven in the classic tim tamsafter photographing them on a fairly humid day they were at their optimal serving level  not quite melted but just about there ready to give their highest and strongest flavour reading  plus it was morning tea time and id just fasted for a cholesterol test and was starving when they were opened they did smell rather inviting  it was interesting to see that the crme caramel in foreground appeared to be coated in a slightly lightercoloured chocolate  would the olfactory promise extend to the taste budsit is with a great deal of pride and relief that this time dear readers arnotts have outdone themselves  these are not some weirdlyflavoured marketing flops but very nice renditions of a classicthe choc hazelnut mousse has a creamy praline filling good chocolatey and crunchy biscuits and nice firm and flavoursome chocolate on the outside  theres some kind of gooey stuff in the middle which was slightly more annoying than enhancing but thats only a minor quibble  the worse news is that one biscuit gives you a hefty wallop of  grams of fat of which  grams are saturatedthe crme caramel tasted even better  a lighter caramelinspired biscuit with lighter chocolate  cocoa solids compared to choc hazelnut mousses  so my eyes werent deceiving me and a gorgeous crme filling with a dollop of stretchy caramel for extra oomph  simply scrumptious  again one biccie hands out  grams of fat of which  grams is saturated  fingers crossed my cholesterol results are good onesnever tried those and probably wont have the chance to as they only seem to be available down under but i must say the name sounds nice enoughyou know a few years ago i was watching graham norton on bbc america and he had some australian pop star natalie umbruglia i think on his show and she was talking about how much she loved tim tamsi  found a website that had imported cookies and stuff and i found some i had a coworker homesick for goodies from down under so i got some for her too natalie explained on the show that she takes a small bite out of opposite corners and then sucks her tea through them i tried it  its a horrible melty mess but it tasted divine tea was pg tips of courseso  if i ever find those im sure to try them makes me hungry just looking at the pictures and i just ate breakfast oh and how did the cholesterol test goyou know ive never been a fan of slurping my tea through them because they just go horribly soggy and sticky which is exactly how you dont want a good tim tam to becholesterol test is fine pumps fists in the air so enormous chocolate consumption lifestyle can continuei think i can sense a sudden bout of depression descending i need someone to send me over an emergency medical kit with these packet in there to ward of the depressionbig yay and woo to you thensee dark chocolate is good for youmolly  youve just described whats known as the tim tam slam delicious but very messyyou know ive never done this must be a bad aussie tim tams need to be cold great in winter in summer the chocolate is very sticky and gooey but the warmth also emphasises the sweetness and these days i find that a bit hard to take the kids though will go through a packet in a single sittingoh look what i foundhttpvwwwyoutubecomwatchvbhzmfzfaqawe just opened a pack of the creme caramel this evening good very good i went back for a second if the kids leave any ill soon go back for a rdim not a big fan of tim tams and canquite easily eat one biscuit and hand the rest of the packet to anyone who wants it but as new flavours come out i will try them if i happen to be shopping for biscuits mostly i skip that aisle i havent bought bikkies for a long time so didnt know about these ill give them a go and if i dont like them ill take the rest to my kidsi like the new crush tim tams
i think the reason i bought this is because it says new on it there i was thinking i didnt get things for that reason but i guess some investigation is always necessaryso i really didnt need to store it much anyway this is a quick one to go chewing chocolates are always gone before you realize it im rather happy to find another one that i can count onlove the warm colour and i was always keen on crisp rice and chocolate milka had a crisp rice slab too  it was delicious
of course the packaging here is very different from australian old jamaica and we have the bournville brand stuck in there for good measure  which to be honest probably puts more people off than it attracts in this day and agethe wrapper proudly claims this is raisins  rum flavoured dark chocolate but in actual fact it contains no real rum and its hardly dark chocolate a quick look at the back of the pack reveals that it contains only  cocoa solids it also contains  raisins and  oddly  milk fatthe treatwise label also shows that total sugars in this bar are g per g of chocolate ouchso really what we have here is raisins with some darkcoloured milk chocolate lots of sugar and some artificial flavourlookswise the bar scores well it has a nice dark reddish colour and a healthy sheen it looks like it would snap quite cleanly if it werent for the preponderance of chewy raisins that stick every chunk to its neighbourthe taste overwhelmingly sugar and rumthe really annoying thing about this bar though is that its just so moreish despite the fact that i really didnt like it i found myself breaking off chunks every couple of minutes without even realisingsimply put this is a snack bar rather than real chocolate but for those sugar addicts with no concept of calories out there it fulfills that role quite nicelyi love this stuff it reminds me of my grandpa it was his favourite chocolate the only stuff he would eat i agree it tastes all kinds of wrong these days ten years ago it was far better but i can still get through a whole bar of it very quicklyi can confirm the taste difference cadburys dairy milk here in oz is foul beyond belief it tastes almost like there is a barrier to the taste you have to get through first someone told me the bar was different as cadburys put something in to try and stop the bars melting in the heat im inclined to believe it avoid at all costsi still remember the pirates in the adverts this was my mums favourite in the s well that and bournville and rosesorange one is nice to try i thoughti used to love old jamaica it was my dads favourite and id buy it for him at christmas and for fathers days and birthdays wed share it while watching tv until i moved away since he died i havent been able to bring myself to buy iti am in the uk and have been trying to find this chocolate for a couple of years having read blog somewhere or other i discovered it was discontinued  years ago  does anyone know anything different  my mum and i used to love this chocolate thanks xkerryanne it is still very easy to get this and a lot of the old type sweets just go through amazoncouk i bought a box of  bars about  weeks and in total  think they cost me just over  hope that helps they definately do taste different i am not sure if this is because apparently this chocolate is halal which i for  am not very happy about apparently most of cadburys chocolate made now is halal onlykerryanne  its definitely available again i think i found this one in tescoi was upset when old jamaica disappeared from our shelves in the late s it was my favourite chocolate and i really hoped that it would return some day ive now bought two bars of the new product im unlikely to buy any more its horrible and cannot be recommended at all the recipe is completely wrong the original old jamaica was a mixture of plain and milk chocolate with rumflavoured rasins the new chocolate purports to be plain chocolate but it isnt whatever it is it tastes utterly foul i am shocked by the amount of sugar in it the rum flavour is even more artificial than the original and the packaging is wimpy who on earth thought that a delicate lilac wrapper would be a good marketing angle if it aint broke dont fix it bring back the classy gold packaging the pirates and the jokey tv ads above all cadbury needs to completely rethink the recipe ideally duplicating the original old jamaica was good before its dire now i certainly dont want to knock it all backi found old jamaica at the norwich pound shop  gram bars i had a tenners worth it was everything i remebered from the seventies im a chocoholic i need to find a cheap supplier despite being struck down with diebetes i love itah lighten up its not that bad just ate a whole bar of it okay so its not what it used to be back in the s and whenever but it still beats mars bars or snickers they could bring back the adverts though they really used to totally slay me remember the one with long john silver aaaarr jimlad get the flavour of old jamaicy incidently why are pirates called pirates because they aaaaarhi really liked this it may not be identical to the original but hey its still a nice tasting bar the pavkaging is a funny colour i do agree but really can people really tell whether the rum in it is fake tasting tastes like rum to me or being pedantic over whether its the raisins which are flavoured or the chocolate honestly what silliness how can you tell stick an old wrapper on it and i bet most people would taste no differencei love old jamaica used to be my favourite bar in the s orange and gold wra p with the ship on it and it was gonedont be fooled by the name the new bournville version isnt a patch on the one i used to buy for my dad in the seventies and eighties for birthdays and christmas the real one was a mixture of milk and plain chocolate and had a much better flavour than the new one the new one is just too sweet and sickly and overpowering its also too chunky the old one was flatter and you got more juicy raisins per bite than the new one overall a disappointing experience  bring back the old onebring back cadbury milkraisin chocolate
for the purposes of retaining the friendship it will be automatically assumed that they dont think that the buddhas physique resembles this particular chocabloggers just that it looks interesting and tastytheobroma chocolate lounge uses belgian chocolate but makes their shapes hollow figures and filled chocolates in melbourne  their website announces that with their arrival chocolate is no longer boring  hmmmm i think that statement is a tad presumptuous  after all why do we have a blog with new reviews every day if the glorious brown foodstuff is boring to be fair to theobroma ive only been there once and enjoyed my gorgeous mug of hot chocolate and huge chunk of triple chocolate mousse cake but was too shy to whip out my camera and photograph it they are apparently also well known for their chocolate and fruit fondue platters marshmallow dipping sticks and waffles as well as doing a rather nice range of savoury foccaccias pastas and of course their gourmet chocolates  ill investigate those another time perhaps when chocoboredom sets in and needs to be eradicatedback to buddha  apart from being made of belgian chocolate there were no ingredients or cocoa content on his little plastic container so it was entirely up to looks and taste  i tentatively gave his belly a little rub before wondering where the most appropriate place was to bite into first especially being such a revered spiritual leader and alli decided on his belly  crack  he exploded open in anger or glee im not sure which and i had little shards of chocolate under my eyes melting instantly  after a big laugh and a small tidy up it was time to taste a few chunks of our belgian buddha boy to be honest everything that is advertised as gourmet or hand made here in australia is invariably touted as using the finest belgian chocolate but no information is given specifically on who made it whats in it why its so fabulous etcetera  im no mathematician but the law of averages does suggest that even belgium is likely to have some chocolate manufacturers that arent particularly good in this case though i can climb off my high horse because the buddha was delicious  he didnt hold any surprising new flavour notes though just the expected good quality sweet and silky flavour that youd expect from belgian milk chocolate  i love buddha and i love chocolate  i shall have to get me one of thesei cant believe you killed the buddha and ate himdom dom dom he was made of chocolate im not made of stone you  know 
heres her reviewinto my hands plopped the pure organic chocolate soap pure organic chocolate lip butter and pure organic chocolate lip balm immediately on the way home in the car i ruffled around with one hand in the bag on my seat and pulled out the lip balm brown and stick shaped it hadnt held up too well with some minimal heat in my car and had gone slightly gooey however application on my lips sent me back to age  when i was round grannies house whipping up a bowl of chocolate flavoured angel delight a delightful smell of whipped desert filled my nostrils and it even had a slight choccy taste to it this quickly turned to a not so delightful taste of lip balm but the texture was smooth and pleasant upon arriving at the local supermarket i met my partner who promptly got a kiss and yes i tasted of chocolate i used the balm for three days and took it on a trip to london where it faired badly with the heat of my pocket going slightly gooey and messy but overall its a pretty good lip balm it did the job smelt delightful and kept my lips nice and shiny for a good few hourswhile regularly using the lip balm i wound in a few evenings with the lip butter the butter comes in a small round tin and has a much harder texture than the balm its identical in colour and smell and acted more like a moisturiser which temporarily relieved my lips of dryness but was not as long lasting as the balm i didnt get the same chocolaty delight from the butter as i did the balm and it did leave a slightly unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth immediately after applying however i found myself reaching for the tin just for a sniff to return myself to the angel delight pleasures of the slast up was the soap carefully packaged in green material wrap with a string bow and printed ingredients paper this was the most delightful to look with its careful attention to detail the soap excited me the most because it actually looked like a bar of chocolate i used the soap to wash my hands for a couple of days and while smelling chocolaty in the water it did not leave much of a smell on my hands i also took it in for a shower experience and while it got me squeaky clean it certainly did not leave me feeling wrapped in chocolate the other big drawback of the soap is that it leaks brown water so my shower and sink were treated to brown stains from the drip of the soap while not a problem to clean up it certainly looked rather dodgy in my bathroom and i got told off several times for leaving the bar lying around out of a dishim not  sure of the purpose of the chocolate range i get the impression from the website that its more to do with personal indulgence rather than proof that you can use organic chocolate in personal products im still not convinced by chocolate themed body indulgence and i will continue my hunt for something that perhaps has some chocolaty longevity to iti can recommend vaselines cocoa butter themed body butter and moisturising gels excellent stuff if youre partner has any sort of talent for massage at alli love the idea of smelling like chocolate this is why i use the palmers range of hand and body lotion and moisturising oil its not organic but its great stuff they also have a chapstick for the lips smells yummyooops thats palmers cocoa butter formulai will only use lip balms that are made out of all natural ingredients and dont contain parabens or any petroleum products  i consider myself to be a lip balm connoisseur because i have literally tried over  kinds of lip balm  i prefer either minty or fruity lip balms so when i heard that the made from earth spearmint and blueberry balm was really minty i had to try itif this lip balm was so thick and waxy it would be one of the best  i love it because it is made with natural ingredients and because it is nice and minty which makes your lips tingle  unfortunately it is very thick and waxy and it doesnt glide on my lips like other lip balms do  that is my only complainti would recommend it to others to try because i am a little picky when it comes to lip products so it might just be me
the milk version is definitely the sweetest of the three it has great cocoa flavours and melts quickly with a good mouthfeel the cocoa flavours keep on building right up to the last making this an extremely moreish little treat theyre probably as good as any milk chocolate ive had recentlywhen i tasted the dark buttons the first thing i noticed was that the sweetness of the milk version was gone the cocoa flavours are much darker with a pronounced bittersweet edge the cocoa is quite subtle at first and as the chocolate melts you start to taste the deeper woody flavours theyre very different to the milk version and to my mind theyd be a good bridge for the milk chocolate lover who wants to try something a little darkertop of the shop in terms of coca content at least is a  cocoa button  the xdark which sounds like some sort of secret weapon these buttons have a sharper aroma with a distinct leatherandwood smell in the mouth they pack a deep dark punch which softens as the cocoa starts to release more of its flavours the overall taste is strong slightly sharp cocoa highs with a soft clean finishi enjoyed all of these chocolate buttons the milk ones are very good sweet milk chocolate and the xdark delivers some excellent flavours to me the dark buttons seemed unnecessary they dont have the soft full cocoa flavours of the milk buttons or the fullon sharp complex tastes that the xdark have tasting them in order of cocoa content worked just fine but when i tasted a dark button after the xdark there was very little thereim not fully aware of how much of a market there is for this sort of chocolate in the uk but i can only assume that there is demand for nutfree products and if so then this range of chocolate buttons might well be worth checking outdark chocolate is my secret weapon  i like the button form too its fun and different great postmany thanks for the review i just wanted to mention that the  dark chocolate is milkfree and therefore suitable for milk allergy sufferers  it is milder than the  to cater for allergy sufferers especially children that wouldnt like anything stronger  thanks again sam
so far we seem to have a score of  out of   kath liked hers i thought the choklad wafers were pretty ordinaryat  grams the pack is very light there is almost no weight to it at all opening up though does reveal quite a pleasant surprise there is actually a decent amount of chocolate covering the waferbreaking the bar apart is a bit of a challenge the wafer is very light but surprisingly tough and so it squashes down a bit before breaking that said the effort is worthwhile  we can see a reasonable amount of filling between the layers of wafer there is not any special aroma so i was wondering what it would taste likethe answer is its pretty good the chocolate is quite pleasant nicely chocolatey not too sweet ah  mercy  thank heavens for that and it complements the wafer well the wafer is light and very crunchy and the filling is pretty good too my major complaint about this wafer is that it isnt big enough it seems a larger size marked xxl is available at  grams that seems hardly to qualify as xxl to methe wafer score now reads  good out of  triedyes we have quite good wafers you ought to try also grzeski by jutrzenka  princessa by nestle various kinds oh and ww by wedel something like kitkat regards from polandhigetting polish chocolate in australia is pretty unusual but a shop nearby has some sometimes and some of it is pretty good another review is coming soon i hope one i really really really liked i remember eating them all the way since i was  years oldi love the prince polo hazelnut i purchase it here in kansas usa at a small turkish marketdeli i havent tried the other flavors because i am totally hooked on the hazelnut i need to find other places to purchase the bar since i moving farther away from the marketdeliyou should have tried prince polo original receipt before kraft  altria purchased it the last one i found was in a canadian store back in  i think the pack was not air sealed but just wrapper alu paper i know some people who still remember the original taste it was awesome believe it or not the new one is just tasteless and we have not found any other wafer similar to the original one
the chocolates all have a quite distinctive look to them as you can seeso what did i receivefirst one out was a white chocolate ganache with lemon reinforced with a hint of limoncello the tartness of the lemon was balance nicely by the soft sweetness of the ganache and white chocolate shell soft in the mouth the lemon flavours were sharp and clean a good counterpoint to white chocolatethe other white chocolate ganache was a cardamon and cream blend the cardamon flavour was there from the first bite infusing the sweet creamy filling with its distinctive flavours if you like cardamon youll love thisa basil and lime concoction provided some interesting subtle flavours ive tried both basil chocolate and lime chocolate before but ive never seen them combined both flavours are quite subtle  theres no citrus blast or overpowering taste of basil and the two work together surprisingly well top marks for braverya real standout was the sesame crunch caramelised ganache with sesame brittle in dark chocolate burnt sugar and sesame flavours combine with the dark flavours of the cocoa to give a mouthwatering caramelnutcocoa hit deliciousthe tanzanie proved to be a little disappointing the dark cocoa flavours were there but the centre seemed to be lacking in moistness it was a little too chewy compared to the previous ones possibly a storage or transporting issue which was a shamea mace and lemon ganache had some interesting flavours both dark and milk chocolate were used to make this subtley flavoured concoction which didnt pack the lemony punch of the white chocolate ganache with lemon but came across as a more delicate cakey sort of flavour combinationthe ginger ganache was a lot less upfront than i had expected the warming ginger flavour came through very slowly and never detracted from the dark cocoa flavours perhaps not strong enough for some people but you could tell there was ginger there alrightthe dark chocolate and spearmint ganache was a bit of a let down not much mint flavour going on at all but the ganache was soft and full of cocoa flavourthe three truffles i tried were definitely the runts of the litter from the menu i ascertained that i had been given a malt whiskey truffle a menthe truffle and an amaretto truffle but the flavours just failed to make any sort of impact i had expected much more flavour from these three and i was disappointed to discover that two of them were indistinguishable from each other maybe they werent as fresh as they could have been i dont knowoverall a good selection of ganaches but with a slightly patchy performance based on the slab tastings i know that the chocolate camaya use is of a good standard but id say that some of these chocolates need a bit of work to get them up to the high standard thats expected from handmade premium chocolatesi like the sound of basil and lime  adventurous but sounds like a good combinationthe sesame one sounds fantastic still waiting impatiently for someone to produce a sesame seed chocolate in australia 
however today i had two guest reviewers one of whom juliet urged me to try dagobas lavender blueberry and then their milk chocolateand with faces like these how could i resist  plus they had chocolate to tryfirst up was the dagoba lavender blueberry with  cocoa solids  when unwrapped we could detect the faintest whiff of lavender which was rather inviting this time the dark chocolate did an excellent job of perfectly pairing up with tiny pieces of organic blueberry and the subtle lavender oil juliets view was it first just tastes like dark chocolate then you chew it and the lavender flavour kicks in  carly added its a nice mild lavender taste  any more would ruin the taste of the chocolate which is very velvety on the inside  not bad for nine years old are they next came dagobas  milk chocolate blockthis bar was a revelation  normally i find milk bars to be very sweet first with the creamy undertones emerging as the second flavour this time however the creaminess was decadently dominant and there wasnt the sickly sweet factor that can sometimes put off dark side dwellers  this is a puzzle to me because the first ingredient remains cane sugar but somehow the cacao butter and milk have combined to produce something exquisitely velvety and creamytheir favourites  oh the milk definitely said carly but the lavender would make a nice present thats a bit unusual for someonejuliet was torn its too hard to pick between milk and dark chocolate because they are just too different  wise words from two very eager guest tastershey are you actually allowed to subcontract reviews out like this i still havent got around to trying dagoba must put it on my list especially the lavender oneif you are impressed with the  milk bars you should be trying coppeneurs hacienda lara  milk chocolate bar or michel cluizels  milki actually  know the wonderful little lavender farm where dagona gets there lavender oil its called peace valley lavender inbucks county pa ive used their lavender by infusing it to make a lavender honey ganache for hand dipped chocolates their lavender makes fabulous chocolatesthe first ingredient remains cane sugar but somehow the cacao butter and milk have combined to produce something exquisitely velvety and creamyits all in the conching process speed and timing need to be perfectly aligned obviously theyve got it rightlove your reviewersgood to know not all dagobas lines are horrible i tried the chilli and chocolate nibs one last summer and it was the foulest chocolate ive ever eaten tasted like cardboard its still kicking around my room somewhere the mark of good chocolate in my house is how short a time it exists eight months is not goodand a great and willing reviewer you were too young juliethey mum the milk was really creamy and snapped easily the lavender one was quite interesting somone like mum tries lots of weird varieties of chocolate would love this for something quite different but really nice in its own special way i think dagoba should make more flavours of chocolate now like lindt and cadbury and nestle itd be good to see what theyd come up withi totally argee with you on that one carly they should too by juliet fraseri had a lovely black pepper chocolate in scotland spring of  seems like it was a major company but i have never seen it here

these two very thin  gram bars are german despite the spanish plantation names with each being divided into six pieces i found them in a handy sale but seem to have made a mistake in not buying more ill just pretend i was purposefully exercising selfcontrol by only getting these twothe  puerto cabello venezuela origin has a very good amount of flavors for a milk chocolate berries and vanilla and a pretty strong milky taste for being so high up in percentage ive had some wonderful milk chocolates but never one so intriguingly flavorful as this one both bars are described as having a full bodied mild taste and i have to agree with that slight ironythe  el cuador ecuador origin only has three ingredients chocolate liquor cane sugar and cocoa butter so it naturally tastes a lot like cocoa powder dark yet not bitter it also has a slight banana taste as it finishes off im not quite as keen on this one but its still not badim probably not going to run into rausch again anytime soon but if i do some more investigation will be necessary both of these bars are very simple but still different from the average find and quite worthwhile especially all the depth that manages to make its way into the creaminess of the milk chocolateoh snap deanna  ive been given eight blocks of all the origin bars theyve made and done my review of the first four ranging from  to   just five minutes i tried the second four blocks  to  so hopefully the delightful dom will put them up as a companion piece to yoursok kath i know youre dedicated but please tell me that you posted your comment at am uk timewow kath theres really something creepy going on in chocablog i used to think i wouldnt have to worry much about someone else reviewing the same thing as me but now there are so many doubleser sorry oliver it was midmorning aussie time  i was sipping coffee and eating chocolatedeanna  doubling up is fine because it means weve all found something that intrigues us all and our views can vary plus couldnt we just stroke each others ego and say great minds think alike yeah they sure taste great just swallowed the puerto cabelloand  funnily enough  the german word rausch means intoxicationdin fact it is not rausch but rasch and it is the name of a clan of the these chocolate manufacturer
over the years weve reviewed many bars made from beans of ghanaian origin but weve never actually  reviewed a bar from ghana so when a ghanaian friend recently went home for a holiday i made sure he bought back some of the local chocolatesthis particular bar is a  milk chocolate with  milk solidsas you can see the chocolate itself looks a little dull with small holes in the corners where the chocolate hasnt reached the edge of the mold theres no real shine to it and i dont think thats just down to the long journey from accraon the other hand it may not look great but it does have a rather nice aroma which hits you and fills the room the moment you open the wrapperbut that dullness is more than just cosmetic the chocolate has a dry grainy texture and it just doesnt melt in the mouth like it should my ghanaian friend insists this is by design and that local chocolate is designed not to melt in the heat but im not so sure i think its more likely that theres something not quite right with their conching processoverall i think its great that ghana is producing chocolate from its own crop but this has a long way to go before its going to be up to the standards that we expect from a good quality milk chocolate here in europe i have some more golden tree chocolates to review and im really hoping for a little more from those we shall seeyour friend is right about the design golden tree chocolate has a very different texture in ghana i came across you blog when i was looking for an explanation as to why golden tree gets so hard when it crosses the ocean that must be why because in ghana its not quite as grainy and not as hard also being from ghana i have been eating golden tree for a while the milk chocolate has always tasted that way even before they started producing the coffee flavoured barhi i was searching online to find where i can purchase some golden tree chocolates and came across your blog i was wondering if you could get me the dimensions of the wrapper for the chocolate i know this is a bit off but im trying to customize some for my engagement and ill need to make new wrappers for that i will be very grateful if you can be of help good job with the blog thoughsofie what an odd requesti can tell you though that a golden tree kingsbite bar is cm x cm x cm and the fully unfolded wrapper is cm x cm and thanks for the dimensions cocoa processing wasnt established in  please check your facts thanksas in cocoa processing company limited ghanai am from ghana and live here in the statei was very happy to come across you blogbut you had something wrong the company is been there for a very long time and not make sure to know the truth before writting your so called articlesthanks sena for reiterating that again also dom quoting you overall i think its great that ghana is producing chocolate from its own crop but this has a long way to go before its going to be up to the standards that we expect from a good quality milk chocolate here in europe european standards may not necessarily be the standard of the world just cos europeans love their milk chocolate to melt in their mouth doesnt necessarily mean that should be the standard for milk chocolate just like when u visit the world of coca cola in atlanta they have various taste of coke from around the world we should maintain that uniqueness in the way people produce their products its a cultural and demographic thing you either love it that way or you dont but that has nothing to do with standardsok have removed the date my review of the bar itself still stands but remember like every other review on this site its subjectivei spent  month in ghana last year  i was sooooooo happy to have found chocolate one day  unfortunately i share the same criticisms as the original reviewer  the chocolate is grainy does not melt in your mouth and while sweet is lacking in depth  i actually didnt mind the taste so much as the texture and i ended up giving the rest of that bar awayi had reasoned that they must have made it that way so that it didnt melt in the heat  because it absolutely did not melt  yet some chocolate covered cookies i had found from britain i believe did melt and wellended up throwing those awayi agree just came back from ghana and this chocolate is pure and delicious with only  ingredients  the natural flavor and texture of golden tree products is extraordinarythank you amyreone of the bestgreenest chocloates i have ever hadml i think when reviewing products from various regions its only right and politically correct to avoid using words like lacking maybe golden tree is purposely made to taste the way it does lacking in depth for instance i lived in the states and england  a combination of  years before moving back to ghana and i find that children there are trained differently academically from children here but dare i say children in so and so are in lack of intellect and common sense all im saying is if u want to write a blog reviewing products no matter how free space blogs are you still need to maintain a level of decorum ive followed this blog for a long time and i know its a good place for chocolate loversi fail to see why a word such as lacking is offensive when refering to a subjective experience of a flavour of a food producti do however find it alarming and frankly offensive that you would attempt to make a comparison between the intellect of children and the qualities of chocolateyou dont have to agree with my opinion of how this chocolate tasted to me  you may well think its flavour is full of depth  but my opinion is that it is lacking depthsoon you will be able to buy golden tree product online i will tell you the address soon am still working onhi  do u have the link already  i really miss this nice chocolate bars  i was in ghana once for business trip  and since then im missing the taste of kingsbite  let me know please i am from the usa but lived in ghana for a couple of years  i loved the golden tree chocolate  every once in awhile i would come across a bar that seemed dried out and grainy but for the most part it was wonderful  it is true that it does not melt unless it gets very hot but without that trait chocolate there would not be very pleasant  i would love to know where to buy some onlineim ready to try some now golden tree chocolate is the bestyou got to be kidding me golden tree chocolate is the best in the world and has won international awards so you dont know what you are saying golden tree is not the crude product you portray it to be review the product with an open mind and you will give the proper review that is duegolden tree chocolates are made with pure chocolate and as such have a higher melting point that is also why the bars are hard unless the bar is some what softened when exposed to hot weather when bitten it will break into tiny bits as opposed to melting into a smooth paste if one really wants it to melt in the mouth it could be placed in very hot water for it to soften up then you will get to know how smooth it is and is not a crude product after allthis was posted in april  adjoa and the bar was freshactually i do agree that the appearance of the chocolate leaves much to be desired  the taste is very different from what you might be used to in europe but its made the way we like it here in ghana we have a wide array of imported chocolates here but every one loves the taste of golden tree best we love the grainy feel as well as the yummy milk chocolate that is truely uniquely ghanaian it does melt wen its in ur mouth its perfect not sticky like the imported chocolates i always miss golden tree chocolates when i travel because i feel all other chocolates excepting one not sure if i can promote that chocolate here lack the awesome taste golden tree has it definitely must have something to do with the kind of chocolate youre used to but if you had reviewed it with an open mind without judging based on looks alone you would have totally loved it oh  u might not be used to pure cocao with no substitutes golden tree is made out of  premium cocoa  it is wonderfuli have been visiting ghana for the past  years and will definately taking some golden tree products home to south africa  looks dont matter one bit  its the taste that counts and above all its a proudly african product well done cpc for this product as well as all the other products you manufacturegolden tree used to have a smoother texture and meltinyour mouth softness and won awards  the taste is really distinctive  great but it used to melt too easily ghana is a few degrees from the equator so i believe they increased the cocoa butter content to keep it from melting on the way out the doors we sell it on the streets in ghana and it doesnt melt so its by design they at one time had an export version but ive not seen that for a long time perhaps that was the softer bari really love your chocolates  am from lagos nigeria how can i get the price for bulk purchasein doing such analysis it is imperative that you look at the factors that where cnsidered in producing the chocolate but not to jump into conclusions please do a bit of research before you make such comments it will put information in the right perspectivenotwithstanding  i couldnt agree with you more that the tast is superior to other chocolatedorm i have a problem when people think we africans should do things to suite europeans for your information golden tree chocolate is the purest cocoa chocolate on earth it was designed for ghanaians and not europeans so why talk about the european standards we prefer the pure cocoa than the sugary taste of chocolate in the european market we will appreciate it if people accept what we have as africans and our ability to produce food with less artificial like it is done in europeyou know my man the cant continue to buy cocoa with that high price to produce good chocolate for their people so the best way for them to do is to give their people sugary chocolate later when their sick the go back to see their own dr for treatmentyou can see how their kids those that eat lot of those sugary chocolate how their teeth look like how many of our kids eat ghana chcocolate and you see our kids teeth in that state  before only food for taught for you so dont take it serious on what ever they saylmfao this is not an indictment of ghanaian chocolate  just chill its a blog aimed at european audience my fellow ghanaians if you feel so offended start your own blog and you can describe kingsbite as whatever you wanti love kingsbite chocolate it is the best chocolate ive ever tasted my kids love it as welli just came back from ghana and this chocolate is pure and delicious with only  ingredients or so and the natural flavor and texture of golden tree products are extraordinary  each bar is stamped with the date is was made and good until and every bar ive eaten has been made within a couple of weeks of purchase  i adore the lemon flavor too  i much prefer this natural product to some of the waxy shiny european chocolates  its a first class one of a kind simple yummy experience also i visited a coco bean farm in ghana which was a lush and organic experiencei need your email address or contact so that i  can introduce a business to you from my locationdonaldhotmailyes it is necessary to pay attention to the dates stamped on the wrapper  i get to ghana from time to time and have purchased kingsbite chocolate bars whenever i cani began realizing there was a difference in texture and hardness in the chocolate after i had purchased them a few times  once i realized this i began to check the dates on the wrappers had some today that was only one month old and it was wonderful and easy to bite  before i was aware of the date stamp i had some that was so hard it was difficult to break  turned out those had dates that had just expiredthe bottom line for me is that ill choose kingsbite over other chocolate bars  wonderful flavor  thank you ghana for such a wonderful product  ill be taking a box of them home to share with friends and familymy friend has just brought some back for the office and i found this looking up the chocolate  i did not like the chocolate but others in the office did and its great because all should be different and experiment with other cultures foodgolden tree chocolate is the best chocolate i have tasted it has a great taste with griveing smell anytime i travel to ghana that is d first thing i get my hands on one thing i love abt it is it doesnt easily melt compare to the european chocolate which even get melted b it get to your tongue so i dont even go for it cos i hate it my best chocolate so far in the world is kingsbite chocolate from ghanai leave in the us and i dont know how or were to get some of the chocolate to buy  if anybody knows please help  my friends here wont let me have a peace of mind until i get them  a ghana chocolate i am a tanzanian woman married by a ghanian  i tested the kingsbite chocolate n it was delicious big up to goldentree i was wondering if i get info on being a suplier of that chocolate here in tanzania
but of course it isnt that simpleits a killer combination an harmonious balance of flavours executed in masterful style a box of this stuff would be a great finale to a dinner party served on a funky plate with some proper espresso coffeei loved it  to deathdid i mention that i fell in love with paul a youngs creations from the first delicious whiff of aroma in his store i just cant resist the subtlety of flavours that he infuses his chocolates with plus his aztec hot chocolate is the best thing everim soooooooooooooo jealous
hachez have also developed a range of chocolate products that appeal to the connoisseurs amongst us  cocoa de maracabo at  cocoa solids darriba at  and premier cru sounds like the name of a tween boy band at a fairly serious however this time it was the flavour that appealed to me  cherry tomato salt  we know that salt sprinkles in chocolate can do a lot to enhance the bittersweet cocoa flavours but what about tomatothe chocolate as expected for  was almost black in colour and the burnt coffee smell of serious cocoa was certainly evident when it was unwrappedthe chocolate was bitter almost a bit too salivasuckingly so and the salt crystals appeared on the palate halfway through the experience adding an unusual but not entirely complimentary flavour  instead the chocolate is too pungent for the salt to enhance and would in fact work better if more sugar was addedas for the tomato neither of us could taste them  we were aware that there were some tiny chewy bits in the chocolate as it melted away but they could have been nibs or coconut shreds for all we knew  the ingredients list provides some comfort in not being able to spot the tomato as they only comprise  of the bar and are followed by apples and then salt  hmmmwe then shared some with stan the sound man and ben the camera guy yeah i can taste the tomatoes ben said eagerly but stan merely shook his head and asked for something to wash his mouth out with before observing but kath ben also reckons that cadbury dairy milk is the beall and endall of chocolate  good point stan good point  this block serves for curiosity purposes onlytomato i think thats a first for usive come to the conclusion that hachez are just plain weirdhi mariangela  i can see why youd have to try really hard to find it because i was really struggling i think that they thought it would be a great idea and really unusual but that doesnt always mean its going to be a successful combinationwhat id like to try would be salt and cracked black pepper chocolate  is there any of that aroundi find it impossible to resist bizarre chocolate bars and must admit this is the first interesting flavour ive tried that i could not stomach im entirely enamoured of the salt  chocolate combination but agree with you that something just does not work in this bar also like ben i could taste the tomato though i am not a fan of cadbury dairy milk  too sweet for me and didnt like tasting it allhave you tried their less outthere flavours such as strawberry and pepper or blackberry and cocoa nibs i love me some nibsyou gave it a fair shake and it sounds odd and i can stretch pretty far for chocolate pairingshannah id love try strawberryandpepper as well as blackberry and cocoa nibs  they sound like flavour combinations worth keeping my eye out forkath its a shame you dont live in canberra by some crazy coincidence i went to a new to me store after i wrote that message and they have those two precise flavours for  each although if you wanted we could do a chocolate swap or i could just send you them if youre interestedhannah get in touch with me via my blog theres an email addy there and maybe we could do a fair swapand if anyone wants to get in touch with kath they can use the contact link on chocablog and itll find its way there 
the figlettes are small  grape sized  and have a shiny round coating similar to the familiar scorched almonds the chocolate enrobed figs on the other hand are quite different firstly they are a lot larger and secondly the coating is not as smooth or shiny the chocolate has been poured over and you can see the telltale flat part where they have been lifted off a tray our guests somewhat unkindly described them as looking like they had been dropped by an alien spaceship the presentation is not as good but its fig season here so they look quite nice when sitting next to a freshly picked plain green figgychopping one open reveals another difference to the figlettes which were dried small figs and quite full of crunch seedy parts these figs though are quite different in texture there is a great deal more fig flesh  dark sticky and moist the chocolate layer is quite thin and claimed as belgian though the source is unstatedwe had a room full of adults and children and ended up having to cut all these in halves to make sure there were enough to go around the universal opinion was that whilst the presentation is a little lacking they make up for this in flavour i thought the figlettes were good these are better not too sweet but rich plenty of nice fig flavour not too crunchy from the seeds sticky very nice very nice indeed all the children present liked them too which is a shame because next time it means ill have to sharecomments are closed
a few weeks ago we had an intelligent thoughtful and excited reader by the name of tam get in touchthe whiff of quality chocolate and ingredients is evident the second the plastic is removed and the tiny protective layer is flung away in eager anticipation  resting in gold they look rather pretty too  but what of the other four flavourssecondly the knobbly looking macadamia croquer  macadamias tend to be found in airport departure lounges and are overpriced soggy and coated in godawful compounded chocolate  not this little treasure  lindt have managed to keep the macadamia pieces wonderfully crunchy as theyre encased in a thick layer of milk chocolate to munch through before hitting the silken inner praline inside  a real macadamia masterpiece that would be great in a block hint hintthirdly the cappuccino delice  actually i think i have reviewed this before but its worth it for the surprise factor  the white chocolate milk froth on top hides a deliciously dark coffee crme inside that sits atop a layer of milk chocolate coffee grains  this really is a cute rendition of a cappuccino that is not sickly but seriouslast but certainly not least is the pyramide noir  this is a revelation and a shame that lindt is teasing us by only putting two in the box  the meltinthemouth dark chocolate dissolves to reveal an even darker creamier filling inside thats studded with tiny crisp wafer pieces  this is my favourite of them all and my dreams would come true if this could be made into a blockoverall this is a gorgeous representation of what lindt does so well  if you gave someone a box of these babies theyd know that you value themi could have sworn we have something very similar here in britain only under a different name i know in the swiss tradition collection there are a few of those chocolates as well as in the petit desserts funny how lindt messes around a bit in other countries with the same sort of chocolatespyramide noir is my fav toobut theyre experts at putting in a few new delights that leave me wanting more cruel but clever
the shininess becomes more worrying once one of these morsels is on the tongue it appears to be some sort of waxy finishing coat chocoronseal and although its pretty thin and doesnt hang around for long its somewhat disconcerting on the palateit has to be said that the most enjoyable part of these was the orange not a great recommendation for a company called kshocoltcomments are closed
first impressions  nobblytastewise its interesting its very sweet and that weird sticky goo in the centre has a foamy texture that feels like youre eating halfmelted polystyrene but all those peanuts do help give it some flavour and texture and its one of those things that grows on you  i quickly polished off the whole bar and promptly felt ashamed for having enjoyed something so very averageas for the chocolate well you cant taste it at all all the sugar and peanuts overwhelm any flavour that was there as far as i can tell its just there to stop the peanuts falling on the floor anywaylooks a bit like the result of a picnic and a chokito getting it on hey thats the bar that the kid gave to the giant deformed creature in the goonies does anyone remember this filmproduct placement at its finest hay  watch how you talk about my favorite candy bar of all time  it may not be godiva but theres no other flavor like it and nothing better for comfort foodthe goonies is the very reason i love baby ruths the st time i went to the states it was the best thing in the world to be able to buy the famous baby ruths the oh henry bars in canada are very similar alsoi cant quite work out if thats meant to be the caramel the nougat or if theyve been mixed up into some weird carougat  nougamel concoctionit had probably been reformulated a few other times since 
their origins are actually in holland where marinus van dam worked on candymaking his sons have since taken overtheres one thing i love about this unless you consider the lime green particularly bold theres nothing too daring or crazy about anything on the box the only words are the quick description on the front and the ingredients along with a brief company history so i had to smile when i lifted the top flap to find in bold plain letters quick while nobodys looking not over the top taking over but just a subtle unexpected detailthey do have the addictive quality of small crunchy sweet salty chocolatey chewy things although im not rushing out to find more marich products most of them seem to be chocolatefree candies anyway im pleased to have tried theseactually these sound quite nice almonds toffee and chocolate sounds like a winning trifecta to mei just tried those recently too though i havent seen them in stores yet they were samples from a trade show  now i know what to look for in stores i thought they were very tasty the crunch of the toffee was great  though i would have preferred more toffee in there
this attractive bright yellow box on the shelf of my local budgens caught my attention so i thought id give it a gonice enough to look at but certainly not spectacular in fact the first thing i noticed was how dull the chocolate looked im guessing thats partly down to the fact that this box was fast approaching its best before date and partly because thats just the nature of flakeeach of the different varieties is given an evocative name escape dream delight charm indulge and classic unfortunately the chocolates dont quite live up to their names in fact they all taste exactly the same  like cadbury flakethere may be hardcore flake fans and people with an affinity for yellow boxes out there that will love this but i cant recommend it for anyone elsenever understood the popularity of the flake myself when theres so much choice available they are nice in a sundae though i couldnt agree more when it comes to the taste of these all of them are pretty much the same theyre almost sickly sweet and very very boring good gift for a kid not so good for true chocolate loverive never been much of a flake fan and definitely not wanting one in my mr whippy either chocolate is not meant to be rock hardim sure flakes were only popular cos the blokes perved over the girls in the ads i believe i had a box of these last year and deemed them too boring to review i think the kids got themnothing is too boring for mehowever much you love a flake like myself a box of these is going to bore you because all it is is a box of the same bar with a little more sweetness
the box confidently called the signature collection was at least a step in the right direction by moving away from the novelty packaging and towards celebrating the chocolate itselfdelicious assorted milk plain and white chocolates it said on the back  and this rather peculiar quote from whom i assume is their fictional figurehead jessica walker more than a mouthful is too much of a commitment  what theas you can see they looked nice enough if a little unassuming for a box of what appears to be entirely milk chocolate except for some tiny white stripes  the heart was just their milk chocolate and the other flavours were lemon twist chocolate truffle burnt toffee truffle and turkish temptationfor such varying flavours it was disconcerting to slice them open and see almost exactly the same fillings inside  the plain chocolate heart and chocolate truffle were impossible to tell apart and the burnt toffee truffle had the most miniscule hint of brown sugar and that was only because i was concentrating really really hardthe lemon was a real lemon  jessica walker describing this disappointment as a zesty lemon flavour is akin to comparing a dead sea lion to a wild party animal sure to be loads of fun  i couldnt taste lemon at all and believe i was trying  as for the turkish temptation it was a real fizzer  one had no turkish filling in it all but was just full of mooshy buttery chocolate mush and the other had a crusty sugary jelly jube inside that emitted a faint rose flavour  if i was blindfolded the only flavour id even have the tiniest chance of guessing would be the turkish temptation and calling it temptation is really pushing itthese are embarassingly mundane flavourless and ordinary  imported from china they contain  minimum cocoa solids yet cocoa is only third on the ingredients list behind the expected sugar and the notsodelectable vegetable fat  surely jessica walker can do better than thisare you sure shes fictional her web site says shes real and the internet never lies does it ha ha ha imported from china nuff said the land of milk laden with melamine time you had a health check sorry id avoid it like the plague some things from china are just fine but be awfully wary of foodlooks like ive been right all along to give these a miss whenever i saw them much ado about nothing i am so glad i read this i tried some of these chocs once one of the smaller boxes and couldnt pick up any flavours at all i thought it was something wrong with my tastebuds relieved to know its just crap chocolate a couple of years ago my office was given a big box of these looked nice but all tasted vaguely the same  we just assumed it was a box that had been sitting around for a long time allowing all the flavours to contaminate one another kind of waxy and boring too bleughyes shes real met her worked with her and yes chocs are fawl and mostly made in chinai received a box for christmas the day after i threw the lot in the binmade in china  dont touch them
i limited my choice to six items splitting my selection equally between familiar to me at least flavours and a some that just made me want to try thema pure criollo ganache was my first choice lush citrus flavours sitting over buttery creamy vanilla and cocoa notes a centre that melted away leaving behind only sweet buttery cocoa notes that lingered in a very satisfying way an auspicious startthe next milk chocolate had me raising my eyebrows on sight who knew what it might do once i tasted ityep a chocolate ganache with fried onionsmay i present number three in the series trees and chocolatelaurelmilk chocolate with laurel extract i admit i had to wait a short while for this one the fried onions were still very much in evidence and my mouth felt like id nipped out to a burger van midtastingthis one was very sweet with powerful evergreen top notes in the ganache i would imagine the extra sweetness was in some part a way of countering the sharpness of laurel when my palate did catch a blast of the laurel it came across as quite bitter moreso than the christmas tree chocolate on the finish it was definitely there to the very end and i found the dying notes of the laurel werent as pleasant as i had hoped having said that the bittrness decayed away soon enoughyou know youve eaten a lot of chocolate when you see a wasabe ganache and say ah another wasabe chocolate id tried something similar in belgium a year or so ago and the combination of flavours worked really wellthis one used a thin layer of bright green marzipan to contain the wasabe element and it was the sweetness of the spice rather than its heat that came through it put me in mind of some wasabe crackers i bought in soho last year there was a very slight element of the heat but it never became chillihot if you like that earthy semisweet flavour this is definitely one to trylast one in the set was a potentially palatecleansing milk chocolate ganache with lemongrass the citrus notes are there as soon as it hits the tongue subtle and sweet the blend of flavours was light and refreshing and the lemongrass came through beautifully building up slowly to a summery mousselike peak theres more sweetness in this one than some of the others but the lemon manages to cut the sweetness for a great balance lovely stuffso there you have it  some of the more eccentric flavours being produced by another noteworthy chocolatier as i said viva is a very popular place to buy chocolates in prague and its not hard to see why i really enjoyed trying these although the fried onion one may be perceived as being a bit much and if im ever in prague i shall certainly make a point of visiting viva againthe lemongrass one sounds lovely but i dont think id want to try the otherswow im curious jealous hungry and repulsed at the same time  fried onions  glad it was you simon that had to eat it but cola wasabi and lemongrass  yes please
but anyhow  chocolate wafers  when i was a kid and mum used to buy them and they would disappear in no time with hindsight there was never anything very special about them perhaps it was just the sweetness and layer of stuff inside that was attractive with this pack at under  and a change from a local brand and with choklad how could i go past perfect to go with my large industrial size mug of tea or so i thoughtseeing as these are exported going by the back label all over the world  treat this as a warning cheap and cheerful but not chocolatey
the truffles do have a cocoa powder dusting but theyre all pinched straight on top which hurts their looks some theyre a little precarious to hold seeming set on melting all over your fingers if you touch them for even the briefest moment but that just means you have to eat them faster the chocolate is smooth and cool and creamy and chocolatey and sweet it doesnt have all those nice subtle flavors and melts pretty quickly but it isnt bad almost reminds of dove chocolate in a way the taste of the cocoa powder seems to save it from being too much like a chocolate syrupso   what can i say truffles is not the right word to use here but theyre edible and plentiful and even very appealing just ignore the imported from france label on four of the boxs six sides it doesnt say anything special about these average aboveaverage chocolatesooh i like chocolate truffles these do sound pretty good i have no idea if there is a trader joes near by me thoughthese truffle are the most delicious chocolate ive ever tasted this reviewer is on crackyes i agree that the reviewer is nuts maybe not on crack but these are authentic french truffles exactly how theyre made in france in fact these are imported from france and are the classic chocolate truffles dusted in cocoa as theyre supposed to be madeid check the ingredients if i were you  i think the first ingredient is palm or palm kernal oil  i tasted a few and the texture was so off for a real truffle that i wasnt surprised when i saw the list of ingredients  i threw the box away  a total surprise and disappointment from tjsi got some for christmas and found them delicious and plan to order some more if i can gind the price and order infothese are the best chocolates ever in the whole entire world who cares about the ingrediants these are heaven on earthi love them they are great to give as gifts
this is a blast from the past  chomp bars were everywhere here in the late seventies and eighties and were one of the cheapest chocolate bars you could buy  still are in fact and a mother at my daughters school confided that these are her favourite naughty treatsconfided is the right word because shes probably about  years too old for the main chomp target market unless she has a liking for cartoonish wrappers featuring a deranged mechanical dinosaur on the side and only seven measly percent cocoa solidsthis secretive mother is also on the trim side so maybe i should not have been surprised to see how stingy the chocolate coating was on the bar when it was unwrapped  half of it was so thin it was already cracking and falling offtheres supposed to be some wafer in there somewhere but like the confounded compounded chocolate it was completely lost amongst the challengingly chewy caramel filling that left a slight metallic after tastethis is best left to the kids or better still avoided entirely unless youre completely starving and dont have enough money to buy a better bar  in which case wait until you get home and eat some better quality chocolate and encourage your kids to do the same life is too short to waste on a painfully sweet secondrate mess that still throws nearly six grams of fat at you even though its only a tiny  gram barive not had one but im fairly sure thats quite different from chomp in the uk i guess im going to have to find one nowget the kids eating the  very different from uk cadbury chomp i love those again for kids but a lot thinner and rather moreish in my opinionah the memories i loved these as a kid as they were insanely cheap i vaguely remember a mint version and some kind of a raspberry or strawberry flavoured one as well or am i losing itno youre not crazy i remember mint flavoured chomp bars no one else does though apparently s wow i wish i had one right nowyikes that sounds way to sweet and not enough chocolate even for me and i do not mind sweet chocolateim gonna get more to my kids they really loves the power of the sweetsso yummyso goodyeah id love to see if the uk chomp is the same it often surprises me how cadbury can make such differenttasting products even when theyre under the same name and labeldont go ragging on the chomp its fantastic as an expat aussie i was having serious chomp cravings  imagine my delight at discovering the nestle drifter  pretty much exactly the same thing if you want to try a chomp but are on the wrong side of the world just snack on one of thesenow if only the uk could give me an equivalent to a cherry ripe and a strawberry freddo id be in heavenhere is my tip for kath if you want good chocolate then go and buy good chocolate did you really think that for  you were going to get a gourmet chocolatei just had a chomp and i can say there was enough chocolate its wasnt flaking off i could taste the waffer my chomp was perfect and every time i have eaten a chomp it has been perfect i remember strawberry mint caramel remaining flavour chocolate and banana flavoured chomps why they got rid of the other flavours is beyond me also is it just a perspective thing or did chomps used to be longer i love chomps you can taste to wafer in a chomp far more than you can a picnic so i dont know what your on about and i have trouble with some sweets giving me toothache and i can tell you chomps dont do it violet crumbles and picnics are on the list of those that dochomps rock g of fat for a g bar is nothing compared to the g of fat youll be putting in your body if we listen to you and reach for g of the  lindtyou my friend are a novice of the chocolate game the chomp is hands down the greatest chocolate bar of all time and was twice voted time magazines most influential chocolate the chomp inspires liberates and unifies  whilst providing a taste sensation name one other chocolate bar that does that
the chocolate itself is smooth and light on the palate and has a quite delicate set of flavours light slightly citrus notes sit well with the ginger and orange but its the ginger that really throws itself out onto your palate when eaten with a wedge of orange the two flavours are all over the chocolate offering a flavour combination thats fruity and warming on the tongue but dont expect to be able to discern the finer points of the cocoa flavoursthe heat of the chilli is there the moment you pop a piece of this slab in your mouth  theres no escape at all as the chocolate starts to melt the cocoa flavours start to come through the heat lightly citrus slightly woody robust cocoa flavours flood out through the chilli heat to give a well rounded bittersweet finish the chocolate has a good mouthfeel and a clean finishthis is definitely a bar for the seasoned chilli lover theres no escape from the heat with this slab so if youre of a delicate disposition or just dont like hot foods id avoid this one on the other hand if you like your chocolate a little fiery then id recommend tracking this down itll certainly make your tongue tingletheir coconut bar remains my favouriteand ive tried a fair few nowim a devoted fan of their dark choc  cherry bar  i always end up ordering at least a couple of those when i shop on their websiteplease  send me oneoh yum  this looks amazing  i love your blog  i have been lurking for a while now zestywhat great flavor combinations  where can i buy these and please dont say theyre only available in great britaininteresting these look very unique and worth a try i have never had any chocolate with ginger or chilies besides the fact that i do not like anything extremely spicyim named after that chocolate but i have never tatsed any i wonder if its good
hmmm ow arrrgh ow ow owww mmmm owyou can guess by the very fact its made for a specialist chilli site that this is more of a bar for chilli lovers than chocolate lovers the heat is intense and almost overpowering but there are actually some rather nice cocoa notes underneath all that heat  and although the label doesnt give much away it does state that its  cocoa solids with the only other ingredients listed being sugar vanilla and that chillithe one thing the label does have is a warning that it may cause skin and eye irritation thats something i havent seen on a chocolate bar beforeall in all this is clearly made from quality ingredients but its really more of a gimmick than anything else its well known that chilli and chocolate go together well but this is taking it to extremes  the kind of thing youd buy to share with friends and see how much you can take rather than for the enjoyment of the chocolatei love chile and chocolate but like all good things they need to be balanced well  the warning is for the chile so dont eat a piece and then rub your eye with the same finger  ai carumbai have a great recipe for a chile chocolate cake made with chile caribe no one ever believes it has chile in it even though it is sprinkled on top of the chile chocolate frosting  mmmmm i should bake one before it gets to hot to bakeyikes i will stay away for this one this would be too spicy for mejust eating a bar of this now wow thats fantastic chillichocolate bars are usually either wimpishly mild on the chilli front or disgustingly cheapo chocolate this is very good quality serious chocolate and the biggest chilli kick available all in one glorious bundle looking forward to the milk and white versions which were also in my latest delivery of hot stuff from scorchio wonderful people
like their ginger treat this bar has the same brown truffle centre and the main ingredient is sugar for both the peppermint filling and the chocolate coating with the ingredients panel informing me that one bar has nearly eighteen grams of fat of which nearly  grams is saturated wasnt making for very appetising reading  despite this would newmans already riding high in my esteem for their loving treatment of ginger be able to convert this wary reviewer over to milk chocolate and peppermintnope despite not having a green or white centre it still combines two the flavours that just do not work well together  milk chocolate  in this case consisting of a minimum  cocoa solids  is too creamy and lactoseladen to do anything other than scream in sugar at the already dominating peppermint leaving me clutching my head in agony and wondering just why my taste buds decided to violently exit via the back of my brain and my eyes could no longer focus on the newsprint this would go down so much better if the chocolate was dark   and beyond would be just fine  please newmansthe newmans peppermint treat is an experience that is simply devine 
a dom mentioned we didnt get a comprehensive list of what we had been given poor work on our part but there are some outstanding items herethese are some seriously good chocolates as you can see the paper cases reflect the house colours of pauls shop  a rich regal purple without exception the fillings are whisperlight rich and bursting with flavour you can tell that theyre made fresh on the premises  the chocolate has a fantastic fresh aroma and in particular the fruit and floral flavours used in some of the chocolates have an intensity that can only come from using fresh top quality ingredientsanother little wonder was the woodford bourbon chocolate a caramelcoloured centre held a dark well rounded bourbon whiskey flavour without the expected alcoholic overtones caramel for an adult palate with delightfully spicy bourbon notes  another winnerthe passion fruit and vanilla was bursting with summery fruit flavours the balance between citrus vanilla and dark chocolate was exquisite the initial bittersweet chocolate hit vanished under a wave of passion fruit which was in turn tempered by a hint of vanilla unlike some chocolates that attempt to fuse cittrus with cocoa and fail a certain german passion fruit bar springs to mind this creation held the balance throughoutwhat impresses about these chocolates isnt just the freshness of the ingredients and their incredible flavours its also the craftsmanship with which theyve been put together the shells are thick and crisp dark and rich and in contrast the centres are almost impossibly light and buttery mr young is obviously a very skilled gentlemanmy three slabs are weremy second slab was a  dark chocolate slab with maldon sea salt and it was a delight deep well rounded dark cocoa flavours with a tang of salt make a devastating combination my mouth was watering within seconds of trying this little slab and im very pleased if a little ashamed to say that it led a short lifethe best was definitely lasta practically liquid lightly salted and hugely chocolatey confection which had me laughing to myself and shaking my head in wonderment this is a seriously addictive piece of confectionery believe me nothing short of a masterpiece  stunningits pretty safe to say that mr young is operating at the top end of the chocolate market his creations are hovering somewhere between alchemy and art and any serious lover of anything cocoabased would be insane not to try some of these i consider myself a very lucky chocabloke indeedinteresting how in australia cadbury have trademarked the colour purple when associated with chocolate they took on a local maker darrell lea who also used a bit of purple and lost now they are appealing the case anybody else using purple is a brave personi was delighted with the sea salted caramel slab  i think its safe to say you cant find anything better than this when it comes to caramelfilled chocolate and a hint of salty flavour goes a long way the only slightly disappointing factor is the size of the slabs puny meagre tiny pieces that wont last longi am actually drooling whilst reading this and looking at the pictures  pavlovs dogs got nothing on me
inside the tastefully designed box each egg half is wrapped separately in sliver foil and hides a big bag of trufflesone half of the egg is  milk chocolate the other  dark chocolate and they both look and taste divine i particularly like the way the hotel chocolat logo is embossed into the shell simple and classyas youd expect the chocolate taste wonderful the milk chocolate is rich and creamy and melts away in the mouth in an incredibly moreish manner the dark chocolate is delicious and fruity and equally moreishthe truffle mini eggs inside each half all contain alcohol theyre packed in quite tightly making this g egg almost solid chocolate just the way an easter egg should bethe truffle eggs arewonder how we can get them down to ozi think you might just have to pester hotel chocolat into opening an online shop down there simon and i are meeting mr thorntons tomorrow maybe i should take him some oh my goodness  im salivating into my keyboard here i luuuuuurve the way hotel chocolat combine their chocolate and alcohol you lucky lucky lucky devilsphwoarrrr  better hope this is what the mil buys us this year id somehow find a way to cope with the thick shell dom 
the  has a red depth to its smell which continues into the taste a little bit of bitterness gets in there too with fruit at the end passion fruit and mahogany notes is how they describe it the chocolate is cool in its remarkable cleanness yet warm in its softness or delicate feelits a slightly bigger jump up to  so this one naturally strikes well not as harsh as that you some with its calm darkness the cocoa flavor is steady with an interesting depth it kind of tastes a little blue like the leaf cover i think it must be the gentlest  ive had and yes its delicate tooall three of these have a certain underlying sweetness that acts subtley on the palate its hard to think of it as sweetness just because that word kind of has a bad connotation to me but its a pure and good sweetness it adds just the right personality so kallari scores high on both the taste and ethics chartsdeanna you seem to be tastingsmelling in colours an awful lot lately im not entirely sure what red smells like though oh i guess i have been been using a lot of colors they seem to translate well into chocolate somehow red isnt exactly the fruity or berry but still sort of along those lines its rich and bold  
yes its easter time traditional time for chocolate wabbits and eggth how these two got together is a strangely contradictory mystery because wabbith do not lay eggth this is however the first time ive seen the bunny come with carrotsoops sorry cawwotthwhen eating any kind of easter rabbits oops wabbitth in our house there is a very important rule you have to break the ears off and eat them first the bigger the ears the more rigorously the rule is to be enforced when smaller the children resisted these days they are more likely to play along anything to stop their father busting the ears off when they arent lookingstripping the bunny and a cawwot naked reveals that they are as the box states just milk chocolate when stripped the cawwot looks more like a folder mary poppins poppinth umbrella breaking the ears off the bunny oops wabbit was kind of hard and i ended up beheading him instead at least we can see that the chocolate has a generous thickness it doesnt taste too bad either actually  though milk chocolate these days is not really much to my taste this is quite sweet backing off the sugar a bit would have made it a bit better and very rich it also melts quite slowly buy this for novelty value only it is terribly expensive for what you get kids might like it but for a real chocolate lover buy them a block of a nice chocolate for about  to  the pricei agree  for the amount of chocolate the price is a bit high although the cuteness factor does mitigate it somewhati agree with pam  the cuteness factor does go a long way we haev a pet rabbit in real life and hed happily over look the carrots for a bunch of parsley  maybe they wouldnt look as pretty wrapped in green foilith thith weally the firth time youve theen the wabbit and carroth together becauth theyve been awound for yearth
the packaging  of which nothing is written in english except for the australian importers details  reminds me of a toothpaste tube and is perhaps aimed at children rather than grown ups  that and because it is a mere  grams  hence the reason why it was necessary to buy twoas you can see its a small unassuming ordinarylooking bar with a fairly thin layer of chocolate  after gently coaxing it out of its tight wrapper a rather pleasant sweet vanilla smell emerged making the effort seem worth it an eager bite revealed two layers of a divine fluffy white coconutflavoured crme wafer filling  it tasted utterly divine and the tiny  grams of snack heaven disappeared in seconds  the second bar was on hand to give me the opportunity to behave more calmly and assess the kagi fret a bit more maturelymy only gripe is the meagre size  please toggenburger buddies   why not make this a  gram bar or better still a  gram blockmmmh ive never had this version but sounds good i only know the classic one filled with chocolate cream which is divine my relatives from switzerland always have to send me some  and you get it in g packs gram packs you say susanne  well thats much more civilised
generously encased in milk chocolate the jellied turkish delight pieces are accompanied by rice crispies raspberry marshmallows and lines of pale pinkwhite chocolate  no ingredients are listed on the pack and for once i decided not to investigate further because i was hungry eager and greedy  also there are times in a chocablog reviewers life when knowing the fat and sugar content isnt going to be helpful especially on a mondaythis is rocky road at its finest but it should come with some warnings or consumer advicei wonder if their other flavours  caramel cherry mint orange vanilla cookies  cream or coffee have the same hyper effectoh my word that looks delicious they dont deliver to the uk oh it looks amazing droooolomg this one looks positively tacky wouldnt mind trying it no matter how sweet and sticky it isomg i shouldnt have clicked the link i want to try them allme too hint hint is this available in adelaide i love rocky road i knew a woman years ago who used to make her own but ive lost touch with her
i came across this in a branch of morrisons uk supermarket chain there was also a dark version but i quite fancied a cocoarich milk chocolate so i plumped for this onecaleys have been making chocolate for over a century and marching chocolate was originally created as a ration for troops in the great warapart from being high in cocoa this is also a fairtrade product with over three quarters of ingredients certified to international fairtrade standards so its bound to appeal to anyone who wishes to support the fairtrade movementim happy to report that its also damned fine chocolate smooth creamy and rich with a soft mouthfeel and a clean finish its everything youd want milk chocolate to taste likehighly recommendedi picked this one up when doing my grocery shopping on my way back home and i was really surprised something so insignificantly looking can taste so delicious really good need to try the dark version now  i bet its equally deliciousi also bought a marching chocolate from morrisons and then went back and bought  more its delicious and fairtrade  of the most important requirements for me  though that was the only time i found it in that store great pityso who are they  how are they able to claim continuity  fascinating
today i had a threesomeive never had one before so didnt really know what to expect i admit i was looking forward to it but having had it im starting to think it wasnt such a good idea in the first placebut enough of that heres a chocolate review insteadthere is a distinct lack of any cocoa flavour at all here which i find particularly sad in an african bar but worse than that is the strong rubbery chemical aftertaste you get from it perhaps that has something to do with the genetically modified emulsifiers or the mysterious flavour listed on the ingredients all i know is it just tastes nastyso unless you particularly enjoy the sensation of eating candle wax from a condom then i would avoid this should you come across it on your travelsi misread that title as bacon threesomethat would probably have been nicer my daughter got me into troublethe sentence in her story book is  my mom likes to have a threesome when we watch movies on the weekend  i had to go and buy one at spar to prove that a threesome is the name of a chocolate made by beacon where can i get in singaporecos i just came back fr sa and bought about  kg of beacon chocolate that not enought for my family and relative they love it not so sweet and full of chocolatehallo ek wil net weet of daar n spesiale promosie of iets is op julle nuts about fruit sjokolade  ek het een gekoop maar geen neute of vrugte ingekry nie net n gewone melk sjokolade  wat n teleurstelling was dit nie gewees nie  sal graag wil hoor wat aangaan laat weet my asseblief
these poor little critters are marsupials that are only about  centimetres long including their black tail with a white tip that forage at night in the desert for bulbs seeds insects and spiders and they particularly like the yalka bush onion that grows in sand plains after a bushfire  like koalas they can do without water because they get most of their moisture needs from their food if chocolate could do the same for me my trips to the kitchen would be halved  the bilbys large ears are useful for listening out for predators  or at least they used to be  the increased incidence of domestic catsgoneferal have made their numbers decrease markedly due to being fartooeasily caught and eatenpink ladys  gram milk chocolate bilby is a rather cute looking fellow but how does he taste  it is ironic that an edible bilby is for sale to prevent the real ones from being eaten out entirely  however in this case what seems initially like a form of animal cruelty against an endangered species is really just for the benefit of finding out if this one tastes as good as he looksat a minimum of  cocoa solids and featuring no weird ingredients he smells pretty warm and inviting when stripped of his outer coat  seeing as the first ingredient is sugar the overriding sweetness of the chocolate isnt surprising but it is then toned down effectively by the confident creaminess that eventually emerges and lingers on the palate  in plainer terms hes pretty moreish  this is a nice version of milk chocolate that isnt too cloying or too oilyi felt a bit of shame in desecrating him in such a way but the pesky emotion soon left me as i continued eating and enjoyingcomments are closed
ive been seeing these little boxes around a lot but i knew that under the smiling cover it would be no better than average which is sad because it could really be pretty entertainingfor immediate relief of chocolate cravings lovesickness exam pressure mild anxiety and extreme hungeri let my hopes go up just slightly at the wrapper inside then started suspiciously eyeing the yellow gold wrapper underneath the twelve big rectangles smell sweet   and very unpromising they taste   horrible thats really the only word hideously sweet in the worst way and synthetic and grosshence the name youd only eat it in an emergency when you have no other options even then   well i guess itll partially satisfy your chocolate cravings if you really are desperate trapped under a radioactive bombed city for a score of years because theres no reason id pay for the box when the chocolate inside is no good these people have a wide range but theyre obviously not putting the attention where it needs to goas you can see the box looks very similar to deannas dark chocolate version the only difference being the colour and the silver foil rather than gold insidethe design of the chocolate inside is a bit different thoughthe result is that the bar smells and tastes creamy and sweet there isnt a huge amount of chocolatey flavour here but the overall effect isnt too badbut that still leaves the issue of who exactly would buy it its a novelty gift and nothing more im guessing the recipient of either of these bars isnt going to go out and buy it again and i certainly wont be eithernever tried these  and probably wont its more a novelty gift than proper chocolate why would i be bothered with eating such stuff if i can have one of domoris single origin chocolate slabsi dont mind the taste of bloomsberry chocolate at all and i love the packaging at least they are innovative in their package designs if not in any other aspecti agree what we have been offering in the us did not live up to the designs you may be pleased to hear that for some time now we have been making all of our chocolate for europe in switzerland and that we are moving all of of our chocolate making to our one facility in switzerland so that we can be as hands on with the making of or bars as we are with the design we tried contracting out in the usa but it hasnt really worked has it with our swiss chocolate makers we now have real confidence as to where our ingredients come from we can make sure there are no additives etc and as we are all together in one place we can make chocolate for the world that we are as proud of as the boxes they go in currently we are making a  cocoa dark a  cocoa milk and we use the same milk chocolate to make our milk chocolate with hazelnuts my favourite we are also working on a fairtradeorganics range which we are very excited aboutits good to read that bloomsberry is paying attention to the quality of the actual product  but we sure were not impressed with our first bar the very cutely packaged marital bliss bar purchased as a valentine tidbit held really really poor chocolate it seemed terribly old though the best before date of  would seem to indicate it wasnt we checked that date after eating our first pieces to see if that explained the awful result poor flavour gravelly texture  it was a real disappointment given the bars description copy employing such words as premium all natural tantalizing superior delectable  none were remotely appropriate  well it probably is all natural but who cares if it tastes that badi wonder if this was some of the american product that giles says didnt live up to the designs a chocolatier from switzerland would have been banished from the country for thiswhere can i buy this chocolates here in the philippinesgreetings from dohaqatarwell i just tried the  marital bliss bar with some trepidation having bought it before reading these reviews but i must say it was really good maybe bloomsberry may have greatly improved themselves in  the past year cos this  cocoa bar was really worth every riyal i spent on itbloomsberry chocolate was one of the few that i actually enjoy  im not a big chocolate person my wife is but after getting some emergency chocolate around  i was sold  i made special trips out of my way to get the bars from the one retailer who carried them in my area  well about  years later something happened and i noticed  i picked up a bar and the taste and texture had changed  i compared the list of ingredients to another bar i had at home and the recipe had changed  i dont know the reasons behind the change but the  chocolate no longer held my interest  i tried a couple more bars thinking it was just a fluke but it was the new recipe  the onceperfect texture was ruined the flavor was inferior  i havent bought another bar since and that retailer stopped carrying them shortly thereafter  given that all this happened about  years ago im hopeful that theyve returned to their roots and brought back the only chocolate i ever craved  it sounds like theyve tried to shake things up a bit id try another bar if they had one near me but im not going to order a  bar online when i cant be confident of the quality
earlier this week nestls pr people got in touch to ask if they could send us some samples of their new aero mini egg and within a couple of hours of giving them the details a courier turned up with a small packet containing five of them why cant all chocolate be delivered that wayi ate three before i remembered i had to do a review so i best get startedpackaging aside this is much as youd expect a little g egg roughly the size of a creme egg or a mars egg or a cadbury caramel egg suffice to say its egg sizeso if youre the kind of person that normally picks up a creme egg or three every time you go shopping id recommend picking up one of these and giving it a goid be a lot more interested if it was mint aero which i love just choc aeros really are boring and being in egg form isnt enough to make me buy onei hope they have these in england  my sister will be there in  months as has offered to bring me home whatever i want  do any readers or the owner have a suggestionbecca  well we have them in england but like most eggshaped chocolates theyre seasonal  im not sure theyll be around in  monthsid love to try them wheres my samplewhy are cadbury still selling creme eggs after easter
the healtheries simple nougat roll with its friendly pictures of coconut and apricot looks appealing i decided to ignore the fact file debunking health claims is getting boringopening the pack reveals a square loglooking thing chocolaty with coconut a pleasant whiff of coconut means were off to a good start thats when things started to go downhill i forgot what a nougat isbreaking the thing into two to photograph was best described as a challenge  one which resulting in bits of nougat chocolate and coconut being spread over me and the kitchen bench note to self must take out of refrigerator for longer next time at least the insides dont seem to show evidence of the dreaded atomic red artificial colouringinside is well white with a few bits of apricot here and there the chocolate layer is very very thin dissection has its uses because we can see just how little chocolate is actually used taste timethis is well nothingy the chocolate is not very chocolaty the nougat is not very apricoty about the only thing that stands out is the coconut oh and its fairly sweet checking the pack shows that the chocolate is compounded oh dearreally the whole thing is fairly inoffensive there is nothing horrible or disgusting about it but nor is there anything to make the eyes light up and have you saying wow its easy enough to eat but just boringmaybe thats why its called healtheries  cos theyve hardly  put any chocolate on it  
kallari calls its chocolate intensely flavorful and delicate gentle i can imagine but delicate especially along with intense i was wondering how they got that but its the perfect word for these eighteen leafmarked pieces they have a deep chocolatey aroma while still reminiscing of an endearing confectionery just   awesome the taste starts out in a deep purpley moves onto the lightest of fruits and ends with a strongly flavorful vanilla that still flows on one level not harsh of striking only delicate especially considering that its a  like a delicate porcelain figurine delicate doesnt mean that it cant have exquisite and thrilling details though it melts delicately too its calm enough that you hardly seem to notice yet theres enough of a gentle effect for it to be a delight in itselfi think no matter who gets a hold of this milk or dark lovers theyre all going to attack it theres already very little left in my handssounds marvellous  and looks quite posh too i love the simple design of the box and the cocoa pod on it brings to mind all those longforgotten colonial stores where can i get someif you follow the link i gave then go from there into their chocolate site theres a link called where to buy that lets you buy it onlineive been to the point of production for kallari its the real thing ive meet the coop members and one of the cofounders an amazingly dedicated gringa american and even have a now healed machete cut on my palm to prove all of this bottom line this is amazing chocolate and if you buy it youre doing something wonderful for people that are on the literal leading edge of stopping rainforest destructioni got a bar of this yesterday from a friend and cannot wait to try it im finishing off a  lindt excellence bar  my mother is from ecuador so i am doubly excited to experience this chocolate
ive been aware of these bars for quite a while but working through a pile of wild n wacky chocolate meant i didnt pick them up until recentlyprestat market these bars with the slogan positive indulgence the reason being that the way they process the cocoa retains a lot of antioxidants a ten gram piece of the dark chocolate or a twenty five gram piece of the milk will provide enough antioxidants to help combat free radicals  so the packet informs methe milk chocolate is a  cocoa blend its bursting with robust rich cocoa flavours with a classic criollo flavour quick to melt in the mouth the cocoa is well rounded with a good soft mouthfeel and a clean finish its a top quality bit of milk chocolate and i found myself eating much more than i anticipated it leaves the mouth clean and ready for a second or third  or fourth piecehaving enjoyed the milk version so much i had high hopes for the dark bar at  cocoa it wasnt as dark as id expected but as you can see it has all the physical characteristics of a good dark chocolate  glossy and smooth with a very citrussy aromaprestat have very kindly embossed each square with a g mark so you can work out how much to take at a time when snapped this chocolate is sharp clean and consistent on the tongue it delivers a slightly citrussy start which blossoms out into slightly bitter not too sweet woody deep bottom end flavours the finish is both clean and light and left me wanting another piece just like the milk bar had done previouslyi was impressed with these bars and would recommend them to anyone who loves their chocolate theyre a little pricier than ordinary chocolate but the tasting justifies the price and with all of those extra antioxidants this stuff might well help balance out some of ones other little indulgencesi think prestat bars are top notch  and not too expensive for a bit of selfindulgence i love their milk chocolate as its not overly sweet a common problem i must saydom  did the egg survive the experiment i was kind of curious how it would taste warm  after all normal eggs are best when theyre boiled so why would it be any different in case of creme egg 
according to the wrapper its a special blend of white and milk chocolate with a layered centre of featherlight chocolate mousse and truffle finished with a sprinkle of sugarand thats a fairly accurate description of this sweet and creamy barat first glance it does look a bit odd though that blend of white and milk chocolate has an unusual lightbeige colour that im not used to and to be frank its not the most appetisinglooking bar of chocolate ive ever seen its also covered in fine sugar which improves the looks somewhat but also makes it very very sweetthe filling is soft but i wouldnt go so far as to call it feather light and theres a bit of an artificial flavour to it which i put down to the sorbitol which is listed in the ingredientsthe overall effect was nice enough but with a few tweaks a little more creaminess a little less sweetness it could have been delicious this bar makes me shudder it was one of the worst things i have ever eaten from thorntons weird colour  dull taste scored a lowly  i believeis it just me or do the individual truffles actually taste betterive not had the individual truffles its quite possible they taste better just because they have a bigger surface area than a bar in the same way chocolate buttons taste better than a big bar of the same chocolate
as far as i can work out the two bars use the same  cocoa blend of chocolate its just that one has an added ingredient im sure the more astute among you can work out what it is from the wrapperswhat it does do though is break up the texture of this dark slightly bittersweet chocolate in its unadulterated form the chocolate has a slightly greasy mouthfeel which leaves the palate feeling coated once the chocolate has melted away there seems to be more texture than flavour because as the chocolate melts it seems to coat the inside of the mouth in a mildly unpleasant way i didnt like the  bar that much but the additional nuttiness of the hemp seeds seemed to reduce the cloying feeling a little probably by about ten percent as that was the amount of seed in the barcompared with most of the european chocolate i have tried this is very average indeed certainly not worth hunting down particularly when there are a number of excellent chocolatiers working in praguemaybe carla would be better off making beer i read your blog email updates every day but i wish i could find some of the chocolates you try in the usbecca we like to show people chocolates from all around the world but i do try to find online retailers to link to where possible some of the things simon finds are just too obscure though weve got a simillar ganjacocholate in slovenia but ive bought it only once since theres too many seeds in it and they overpower the cocholateand youre not left laughing after allthat sounds a bit like the dagoba hemp seed bar i reviewed a little while ago   more gimmick than taste in my opinionmy czech is nonexistent but the horka horka under the main label of the first block sounds like something youd do to get rid of the taste in your mouthkath  horka means bitter i wish i read this before i bought three of them for my cannibusloving buddy oh well at least hell be entertained by the packagingand the placebo effect my be enough to leave him happyshhhhthey make only a white version now it could be better havent tried but i like their other chocolates though greetings from czech rephello im from the czech republic we have a better chocolate than these white version is really better
a decent chocolate  ginger needs to have a generous coating of good chocolate over a juicy piece of crystallised ginger so that you can let it melt slowly and then chew up the ginger of course just greedily chomping the whole lot up quickly works well too the slow method is better taste test because you get to see if the chocolate was any goodas you can see these poor little things have a few white marks  probably due to our extended spell of hot weather the other lighter marks indicates what happens when they roll around in a bag and bump into each other not that any of this matters at all in this casefor the dissectionists a quick look inside shows great promiseeach ball is about the size of a generous grape and inside there is a generous piece of ginger im pleased to report that the texture is not too dryon the taste test these measure up pretty well ive had better from an obscure place that my motherinlaw found  and ive been searching for something as good ever since using that longremembered sample and giving it  marks out of  this one scores about an  or   which is pretty good in my booksheartily recommendedyes i agree with you  they are nice and  ballantyne are a bit of a quiet achiever on the choc ginger and afterdinner mint fronts in australia  mmmm maybe ill need to go and have some myself right nowkath what store can i purchase these yammy ballantyne ginger lovers in sydneyhurstvillesutherland shire  i was given a packet and would like more thank youi have seen these in supermarkets you might have to look around a little to find themthey are made by fyna foods in melbourne and stocked in coles woolworths iga supermarkets etcive seen them at big w mirandai havent been able to find any chocolate ginger better than these i loooooove them you just made me want to go and get a packet you made kath hungry toosarah  have you tried the darrell lee ones my nan used to swear by them but ive never tried them i agree through that these ones are really morish yeah and i cant remember getting these without any white on them maybe its always hot when i buy them but theyre seriously the best so yummy a bad or a box doesnt last long at our house but i end up with all the tiny pieces of the dark chocolate melted into my pants or lounge it goes everywhere when you bite them all part of the joyinteresting that im not the only one seeing the white markings id put it down to the warm weather but maybe notand i hear ya about leaving the bits of chocolate all over the lounge
this g egg is made in two mirror image halves each with a thick base that form the sandwich when pushed togetherive no idea if thats deliberate or if its just my messed up mind but it does seem a little oddthe quality is great but i cant help thinking that a lot of the hotel chocolat products ive tried lately have been just the same old chocolate poured into different shaped mouldsthis egg could undoubtedly be improved no end if it had been filled with luminous limegreen prawn cocktail flavoured foam or similar im sure kids will love it as it is but aside from looking like a pair of chocolate breasts it just doesnt quite have the sense of fun that i want from hotel chocolathaha dom i thought exactly the same thing boobies when i took the pictures for my review of the fruit and nut version of this i didnt put it in my review as i thought people would think i was a weirdo glad to know i wasnt the only one thoughjimim so glad its not just me although it could be were both weirdos of courseim sure my sisters baby daughter would try to suck on those great  already bought  of these for family members  now when i hand them over ill be thinking boobs boobs boobs nobody notice the boobs im sure theyll be tasty though dboobies or not its a sad day when a hotel chocolat delight fails to excite you dom  boy youre getting spoiledi dont think im spoiled all i want is luminous lime green prawn cocktail flavoured fillings its not like im asking for easter eggs with frickin laser beamshehe chocolate boobs  seriously though i wish hotel chocolat was available in australia i love seeing all the really unique things they come up with especially during the different holidaysthey do look like breasts big purple white and brown chocolate breatsnot so sure i would serve them to the kids i maybe would hold aside for the adults in the family and have them for a conversation piece
both slabs use the same blend of  belgian chocolate with the other ingredient sitting in the topside of the slab the milk chocolate used is a good rich creamy blend with a well rounded flavour and a soft mouthfeel it offers a very pleasing combination of sweetness creamy milk flavours and quite deep cocoa notesthe first slab i tried was this oneslab number two is a cherry  kirsch offering and unlike the previous slab this one definitely carries the flavours in the chocolatecamaya have used a kirsch flavoured syrup and freeze dried cherries in this one and theres a delightful counterpoint between the slightly heavy sweetness of the chocolate and the sharp citrus tang of the cherrieswhether or not youd enjoy this slab very much hangs on how you feel about cherries theres no escaping the cherrykirsch combination as its part of the chocolate personally i found it a bit much after a couple of mouthfuls whereas i could have cheerfully munched my way through the coconut slab well actually i more or less did just that  very hard to resist just one more bitif youre after experiencing the subtle cocoa flavours of the belgian chocolate forget the cherry  kirsch slab go for the coconut bar and savour the opportunity to separate out the elements a little more theres more chocolate flavour in the coconut slab but the cherry delivers bucketloads of fruitinessif on the other hand youre a fiend for cherries and chocolate and relish every fruity little nibble then by all means get your hands on the cherry slabi actually loved both although my favourite camaya choc is the dark one with freeze dried cherry  its absolutely lovelythe cherry one looks lovely
i dont know what it is about all these very dark chocolates that makes me want to have more than usual after each piece or piece of a piece it melds to you more and more sitting in your mouth and mind it tastes like the dark sky of a new moon when the blackness is all around you but the air feels beautiful against your skin as you lift your head up to the sky feeling both high and low on the earth  its one of those chocolates that if you can connect with it youll never want to disconnect remember that its an  but if that works for you dont pass it bywhat a beautiful description of chocolate im planning on making a very special chocolate cheesecake for a friends birthday as a surprise i will be using  bars of valrhona  cacao the look on her face will say it all
valrhona has been spoken of so lovingly by so many world famous chefs in recent years i thought it was time to give my wallet a hammering and buy some  first i had to find it as it wasnt exactly at the front counter of my petrol station or fish and chip shop and eventually i went to david jones to buy this compact  gram tin of jivara for oh dear that is a lot of money  translated that is around three hundred aussie bucks or  per kilogram  upon opening the tiny treasure trove the delicate gold lettering told me that in order to enjoy this as much as possibletake the time to awaken your senses observe the color listen to the characteristic snap appreciate the texture on your tongue and enjoy it until all of the aromas are releasedat  for each five gram square i intended on doing just that if only to make them last a bit longerthe tasting wheel informed me that my jivara lait  was rated a  for force intensity with  as the highest score one bean each for roasted nuts acidity and bitterness with four beans the highest out of the other varieties included on the wheel  being a milk chocolate it was understandable that fruity scored a big fat zero  essentially jivara lait is valrhonas second mildest chocolate with tanariva lait  being the mildest and abinao  the strongestdespite being encouraged to observe the aroma there was pretty well nothing to sniff as each tiny square was unwrapped  when placed on the tongue it melted quickly and gently revealed its generous proportions of milk and cocoa butter  the wrapper spoke of a vanilla finish but my taste buds were revealing a honey caramel which didnt seem so surprising when brown sugar was found on the ingredients listi do love valrhona but im more of a dark side fan so ive never tried the milk varieties my local food hall stocks all of their products so im pretty sure one day ill pop in and pick up a few bars mind you theyre not cheap here either   for a  g bar is not cheap but as far as im concerned the  caraibe bar is worth its price this is the chocolate that paul a young uses to make his caramel slab imagine how posh that isoh by the way ive just tried paul a youngs salted caramel slab  its absolutely wonderful i wanted to share it with my partner but devoured it on the train and so failed to bring the posh choc home my god at   kg it would want to be outofthisworld special it really does seem a bit over the top for a result of it being ok compares well with other premium brands at a fraction of the price then ill give it a miss thanksyou do not buy valrhona at retail you go and hit up your local catering supplies store and get it as close to wholesale as you can manage dirty secret but the chefy types i know wouldnt use anything else unless they had to pay retail thanks for the tip annabels  maybe ill try the  caraibe that maggie is raving aboutoh and simon  omg it must taste divine  and be ridiculously expensive
being factory chocolate the outer shell is very similar to their other products its sweet slightly creamy tasting but without too much in the way of complex or distinctive flavours pleasant enough but relying heavily on sugar and smooth texture rather than any cocoa richness the filling is a  hazelnut praline and its smooth rich and thankfully doesnt add any more sweetness the thick chocolate shell sticks around for a while after the praline has melted away reaching a sugary peak before easing off into light cocoa notes its a shame really  the only time i really tasted the cocoa was at the enda quick look at the ingredients and i see that  of the product is carbohydrates and im willing to bet that a good amount of that is sugars i have no doubt that ikea will shift truckloads of these a lot of people like their chocolate like they like their tea milky and sweetnot one to go out of your way for but if youre there next sunday and you forgot the card you may get to redeem yourself slightly with theseit looks like i love milka pralines rip off to menext weekend is valentines then what was i doing last monthno a good editor would have deleted valentines day and inserted mothers day
so anyhow she posted one over along with a few other goodies that will be reviewed right here soon ive been remiss i have a bunch of things waiting to send to her but it has been so hot for so long here that i was concerned it would all be ruined in the postal system after hearing about this one ive been hanging out for  months to actually try it so after it sat for a week or two the moment could be postponed no longerthe opening of the pack produced the first disappointment the australian heat has done a bit of damage the insides are whitened and slightly crumbly so the look is not good at all nevertheless a little discolouration never hurt anybody on trying it the texture isnt all that good either heat be damnedthe flavour on the other hand wow ive never had anything like this before this is really something the cocoa is a mere babe at  and it looks to my schoolboy german translation as though it has butter fat from those things that go moo as well as the cocoa butter its incredibly rich so a square is enough but thats fine because the spices and the richness go together really well i cant pick that the spices are cinnamon and coriander  neither dominate instead its just a rich blend of powerful flavoursi did an experiment seeing as the texture is all crumbly from the heat during transit i melted a square easily done in a cup thats placed in a bowl of boiling water  a trick i heard somewhere for rescuing chocolate thats heat damaged very quickly it had all melted and i could spoon it out to set again a soup spoon seemed as good a thing as any to set it inas you can see we now have a nice mediumdark glossy chocolate all restored to a suitable glory the effort was worthwhile because a tastetest after this recovery showed that the texture was soft rich and very smooth the flavour is also improved  so its pretty much as mr lindt intendedid really like to see these appear in australia even if only for a little while in the middle of our winters much like they appear for a short time in the middle of a german winter this would make a really nice treat for a cold night sitting around a warm fire how about it mr lindt please bitteim a real fan of lindt and i love their seasonal creations almost as much as i love the petits desserts range havent tried this one  hope theyll launch it again next year so i can lay my hands on it ashleigh youre not just a pretty face  excellent scheme in melting it my friend  this is precisely the type of interestingly delicious flavour that id love to see here in australia during our winterwhaddaya say lindt australia  all you have to do is ship over the stuff thats left over from the northern hemispheres winter and give it to usits really nice rich try hard and you can pick the cinnamon i always think the art of spice blending is not to have a result where you can tell whats in it  rather to have something thats really nice and leaves you wondering how the heck is was done and this one fits that billwow  i love cinnamon even more than chocolate and thats really saying something i hope we see these in australia as some pointwelcome to the chocablog wailywaily lindt gangthose yerpeans have all the best stuff  hand it over lindtseasonal special i am in denver colorado and it was sent to me from germany  i hope my german santa thinks i am a good girl next year and sends me more  by the way a square goes great with a glass of red wine especially a malbec
as with most all cadbury products in america its actually made by hershey the first thing you notice is that its sweeter than dairy milk yes that really is possible and a quick glance at the ingredients quickly reveals whyingredients sugar sugar corn syrup inverted sugar lots more sugarobviously im paraphrasing but there is an awful lot of very sugary stuff listedthe chocolate is also slightly greasy in texture its edible but its not like the cadbury chocolate we get here in the uk which is by no means perfect but it is better than thisthe caramel looks similar to the dairy milk caramel and has the same consistency as you can see it slowly flows out if you cut a chunk in halfbut again the taste is very different i didnt pick up any real caramel flavours at all here instead it tastes more like a liquid marhsmallow thats been melted over a fire its got the same sweetness and a slightly smoky flavour at the end  but its not really caramel  its processed corn syrupbut even having said all that i ate the whole bar its not something i could particularly recommend but sometimes its interesting to see whats being sold on the other side of the world and thanks to the internet i dont even have to leave my chair to do itim canadian and i can tell you the hershey version neither tastes nor looks anything like a canadian cadbury caramilkas a new zealander who has lived in london i can tell you that what cadbury call caramello here is pretty close to your dairy milk caramel  perhaps that accounts for part of the confusionnot all cadbury sold in the us is made by hershey  the more seasonal items are imported from the uk and canada and distributed by hershey
this was a present from a korean friend who brought it back after a trip home lotte is a company with bases in both south korea and japan and seems to be the nestl of that regionunfortunately the chocolate itself was very average it didnt have any great flavour to it at all but i had to bear in mind that it had travelled an awfully long wayi think its safe to say that you wont see my eyes light up the next time i see a crunky bar it was unremarkable runofthemill stuff and theres far too much fantastic chocolate being made out there for me to ever want to be bothering with stuff like thisi agree with dom the name crunky brings to mind a lot of things but decent chocolate isnt one of themim sorry but to me this is only the best candy bar god ever gave man the power to create and i loooove chocolate i lived in korea for almost a year and my weekend ritual was waking up shopping the markets going home bar hoppingwell i was babysitting my hubby and his friends lol waiting till am when the soldiers were on kerphewsp and being sent for all the snacks since i was the civilian  top of my list crunky bars then id go get the boys there yaki man dusp again
on the other side of the paper and foil the bar kind of looks like a sheet of uncut lego blocks but the strong smell with the slightest touch of spice is encouraging they call it a full roasted intense dark chocolate flavor with the slightest hint of sweetness and earth tones when i started tasting it i thought maybe you could trade earth for dirt tones but i realized in the same instant that most people dont like to associate dirt flavors with the things they eatbut im not saying anything negative im just thinking of a coolness inside warmth and an almost frothy essence theres more than a hint of sweetness though even if that isnt the biggest focus nice melting pace and a very fine consistency that i loveit really isnt my favorite though certainly enjoyable but everything about it tells me its perfectly suited for the average persons major chocolate fix my guinea pigs er friends agreed that its great for their personal chocolate stashes for those who get a little too frightened by other dark chocolates but still want something a bit specialcomments are closed
despite my pompous dismissal of the packaging there was a pleasant sweet and dark aroma when the plastic wrapper was opened  the rectangular chunks of chocolate are rather large and deep and very very difficult to snapleaving it out to soften slightly helped matters a bit and gave me a chance to peruse the ingredients sugar first so there wont be a huge cocoa solids content  which is a bit optimistic to call it dark chocolate in my opinion cocoa butter butter oil milk soy lecithin  hang on a second  butter milk oil  what the blown gasket was that  if nothing else it explains why a mere  piece serving of this chocolate will reward the eater with onequarter their daily allowance of saturated fatand the taste  awful  bloody awful  this was like cooking chocolate  just cheap nasty compoundoily sharptanged and gluggy in the mouth  yuck  no wonder its the supermarkets own label and the manufacturer wont reveal themselves because this is just not good enough  no not even for cheapskate bargain hunters who hate their friends  whats worse is that over three days i persisted in eating it to see if it improved or to check that i wasnt being unnecessarily snobby or too harsh  instead i was rewarded with a headache for my effortsto describe this box of poo as deliciously full bodiedpure temptation with a wonderfully delicate texture and a luxuriously rich flavour is to tell big porky pies  id rather eat mud  or carob  avoid like the plague  or someone suffering from the plague holding a block of this in their infested handsso you really liked it thenyou need to stop holding back and tell us what you really think ooh god surely nothing can be worse than carobbelieve me this would have been good compared to carob kath exaggerates a little only a littlewhat i dont understand is why you chose to torture yourself with this thing the word chocolate would be an exaggeration instead of just feeding your rubbish bin maggie everyone around here has to eat their share of bad chocolate so they can fully appreciate the good stuff its the law im confused  woolworths closed down over a month ago  so i assume you cant get this chocolate anywherejeremy read the previous comments  woolworths in australia is a different companywoolworths select chocolate is no longer  the unknown manufacturer had its factory burn down not that well miss it  but you can no longer buy itaw ben thats such a shame so do you know who the unknown manufacturer is  ive love to knowits a genuine shame however for the people who worked there who lost their jobs  heres hoping that the company finds other employment for them prontoi totally disagree  and i loved the big big chunksthe instant thoughts for the select dark  sugary crumbly in the mouth cheap nasty crap it must be compound came to mind select dark also gave me instant headache for some reason only after couple of squares   
for obvious reasons this tea requires a little more brewing time than your average cuppa whittards recommend serving this indian style with hot milk and lots of sugar obviously the hot milk puts a bit of temperature bag into the teain the bag this tea promised warm spicy cocoa and cinnamon notes in the cup the peppercorns and cardamoms really come to life spicing things up nicely the natural sweetness of milk and a good dollop of sugar soften off the spices combining well with the cocoaits a sweet hot blend well suited to the cold winter months and definitely something worth trying if you fancy something a bit different its also well suited to those who favour a lowcaffeine life highly recommendedsimon dearest considering your usual international and often out there offerings this is almost nannaish of you this looks good i imagine itd be pretty good with almond milk im vegan i was really unsure about it when i saw it in store  so thanks for the review
one of the most disappointing reactions anyone can have after looking forward to their daily for me or weekly chocolate treat is to snap off a few squares let it swirl around the mouth for a few moments before dismissively grunting mehperhaps my hopes should have been much lower to start with  firstly its a supermarket own brand of chocolate and secondly its in a wrapper makes the product look about as appealing as an ingrown toenail removal  this is not the kind of chocolate you can take to a friends house to share and hope to receive a warm welcome  usually such products are made by a more wellknown commercial enterprise as a bit of an earner on the side but when i contacted woolworths i was told that they werent allowed to tell me the manufacturing firm because it was commercially sensitiveokaaaaay so commercially sensitive might be a more tactful code word for second rate or company rejects because this stuff is bland bland bland  despite having sugar as the number one ingredient followed by the expected almonds full cream milk powder and cocoa mass and consisting of  cocoa solids which isnt bad for milk chocolate there was no impact on the taste buds when a square or four was sampledthe almonds inside were nice and crunchy but the chocolate covering them was impossible to taste  frantic chewing slow sucking gentle melting serving at room temperature nothing helped to bring out any distinct flavour  it might as well have been sugarless carob for all of the impact and enjoyment it provided and no thats not a compliment  avoidperhaps its not such a bad thing that woolworths collapsed then woolworths has collapsedwoolworths in australia is not the same as woolworths in the uk ripi quite like woolworths own brand ripoff of top deck cant remember what they call it  duo or something but i havent tried the other types of chocolate and now i definitely wont try the almond the plain wrapping is a bit puzzling i thought woolworths select was the upmarket own brand for the richer and more discerning customers so youd expect them to put more effort in heyoops i forgot chocablog is truly international  woolworths down under is still strong but the british one went into administration last year just a couple of days ago one of the shops reopened as wellworths theyve jsut started bringing the select range into nz  i will ahve to remember to ignore it and stick with the whittakers yep ignore it in nz and stick to fabulous whitakerswoolies select is a nice marketing idea but homebranded luxury treats like chocolate just arent going to cut it in terms of sharing with others my reaction would be oh so im worth the cheapest block at the supermarket hmmi agree that woolworths select chocolate is best avoided its like eating compound chocolatehave you tried the youll love coles belgian chocolate its almost as good as lindt  very smooth  creamy i get the milk chocolate variety and no longer buy cadbury dairy milki have to disagree although other brands of chocolate are absolutely delicious woolworths select almond chocolate doesnt deserve all this bad publicity sure the chocolate taste was no whittakers but its certainly eatable for  a block its worth it and cheap enough to give it a go whats the worst that could happen apart from nut allergies 
my chosen bars werewhite chocolate with sesame and sea saltmilk chocolate with stem gingerthree very different  but equally interesting  little barsthe trufflesfoolishly i didnt actually take the time to write down the names of the individual chocolates in my little box but as you can see they all look wonderfulthere were three in particular that stood out for various reasons  the caramel the tobacco truffle and a marmite ganache picturedthe tobacco truffle on the other hand was not my cup of tea the tobacco was far too strong for my taste and got to a point where the tingling feeling almost started to sting you can tell its made with quality ingredients but this one was just too much for mesounds fabulous  i made some espresso and chocolate coffee break muffins yesterday adding whole foods dark chocolate chunks and the chocolate was the best part reallyi am drooling with envy and delight  salted caramels marmite that you loved the studded chocolate blocks does he deliver to australia  the ginger bar and the salted caramel chocs sound the best would love to know if theres any kind of salted caramel products in australia as the combination sounds like a winnerok i changed my mind  i want some of those salted caramels instead of the peanut butter cups chocolate and marmite  brought together in perfection oh what an umami treat if you want to know the backstory to how paul a young britains top and very young chocolatier came up with this winning combo buy my recently published book the mishmash dictionary of marmite an anecdotal az of tarinjar all is revealed tons of other tasy mightm nuggets of info too and not all to do with eating it for info go to mishmashmarmiteblogspotcom  the book is like the stuff itself  ideal for dipping into spread the word  thanks maggie hall

as i slowly plough my way through the spoils of last years road trip across europe im remembering the stops we made the people we met and finally im tasting some of the chocolate as wellas one might expect from an italian chocoboutique located in venice the produce was rather pricey and given the heat of the day and potential transportation and storage problems i resolved to choose just one bar from the myriad on offer this one caught my eye for two reasons one its made using organic ingredients the cocoa cane sugar and cocoa butter are all biologico and two it contains violet flavoured  sugar crystalsas a young lad suffering the hardships of living in a sweetshop in the s i ate mor than my share of parma violets among many things and while previous attempts at nostalgic sweetietasting have been less than satisfying too much sugary perfumey sweetness for me these days i did think that a sprinkling of violet flavour tempered with a good hefty dose of dominican republic cocoa might be worth investigatingin the style of many handmade bars the extra stuff is studded into the back of the bar as you can see or is it the front i tend to think of the top or front surface as being the one with the squares but this packaging seems to contradict that answers on a postcardthis chocolate is a light soft flavoured confection with fresh creamy properties not unlike a full bodied milk chocolate theres a very subtle underlying bitterness and acidity to the finish but in the main this is a surprisingly soft and delicately flavoured bar the sugar crystals do pack a sizeable amount of violet flavour but they dont hang around for too long blending well with the darker flavours of the chocolate and enhancing rather than overpowering the taste experiencei was expecting a more hefty cocoa taste from a  bar but this proves that good quality chocolate doesnt need to overpower the palate in order to deliver  soft in the mouth well rounded and with a clean mildly acidic finish i liked this a lot shame venice is a bit of a hike from berkshire really still if you ever find yourself in venice do pop in its a welcome relief from carnival masks and coloured glass ornamentslooks delicious enough though im not really a fan of floral flavours i love their website and i love the online boutique even more id much prefer going to venice and popping into the actual shop myself but online shopping is better than no shopping at all oh it looks divine and i loved parma violets and think that haighs dark chocolate violet cremes are their very best individual chocolateshmmm do lindt do a violet versionyou might just have to bite the bullet and mail order one kath either that or get matts arm right up his back and extract a promiseive only ever seen violet flavoured fondant and as much as i like that the sugar crystals seem so much more appealing gosh how much i want some nowda viziovirt cioccolateria ci sono stato a gennaioe stato fantastico mi sono piaciute le praline al tabaccosapore deciso e originalealthough my italian is somewhat limited thanks for the comment however tobacco and chocolate is nothing new to the wise old men of chocablog
this limited edition raspberry flavor is going to be available for easter this year looks like itll only be released in these piece bags of minis half of the springstyle wrappers are silver with the other half a solid pinkim not sure how much i like the raspberry taste though it tasted pretty fake to me so i decided to get some second opinions taster one i like this one but i dont think i usually like  musketeers or was that you no wasnt me i like the stuff taster two its too moist and sweet okay   so much for second opinions ill just have to disagree with that part the texture and sweetness are on the same level as the regular versioni guess with filling easter eggs you can need just about as much candy as for halloween so these small individual wrappers fit in with that idea i still prefer the regular  musketeers but there isnt enough actual difference that you should shy away from buying these if youre after some candies in easter packagingi cannot find anymore of the raspberry candy musketeers any where is there anyway of getting some  please let me knowmary ann coleman
then again who doesnt love chai tea   its hard not to giggle at their philosophy typed on the back  chocolate is sacred there is an art to the alchemy of chocolate an art we explore with mystery and integrity  in keeping with their philosophy of mystery  dagoba are not revealing exactly what spices theyve used in their list of ingredients  apart from their organic milk chocolate organic cane juice organic cocoa butter etc theyve only mentioned crytallized ginger and essential oils  however the smells drifting up from the bar when the gold foil was opened suggested cinnamon cardamom ginger and clovesas you can see theres a bit of white bloom on the chocolate due to it having melted on the way home being reset in the fridge and then getting soft again whilst photographing this  blame the hottest aussie summer weve had in at least twenty years  if the flavour survives this weather itll survive anythingthis bar disappeared in no time at all and paired up extremely well with a hot cup of black tea  this is a hundred times better in flavour complexity and taste than dagobas seeds dark chocolate bar so im now keen again to venture out and discover more of their other varietiescomments are closed
the cocoa flavours are there as well  very soft creamy milk chocolate with a little extra sweetness from the berries when i tasted this i had a couple of squares and the sweet richness of the chocolate meant i wouldnt have wanted to eat much more in one sittingtheres also a spiced lindt bar ive tried geheimnisvolles afrika african spice as near as i can tell it has coriander carroway and something else i cant place in a dark chocolate base again really great if different bar and again something i wish we could score here in the states
i found these brightly coloured little chocolates in thorntons little brent cross shop my friend was looking for a birthday present and i well i was attracted by the brightly coloured boxyes i know thats badhandily thorntons do these eden soft centre chocolates in three different sizes so i went for the smallest g box which contains  chocolates   dark  milk and one whitethey areoverall a really nice collection for those that like their chocolates soft and fruity given the names and presentation lust desire passion etc its probably not the most appropriate mothers day present but as a gift for the wife  secret mistress  both im sure it would be greatly appreciatedi cant get enough about this i love it
the club fruit  nut suffers none of those defects the chocolate is however a touch disappointing  at least as far as its claims meeting reality to call this rich dark chocolate when it is only  cocoa does seem a bit of a stretch in my books that barely qualifies as dark the texture is quite soft and it melts quickly this just confirms that its not as dark as some in spite of this the flavour is pretty good but it is quite sweet nevertheless the nuts are good  fresh nutty and crunchy theyve been roasted and the crunch and flavour show this the sultanas are very juicy and full of flavourthis is a pleasant eating chocolate it would make a fine introduction to something a bit dark for those who live in the land of white or milk chocolate the nuts and sultanas are good and its easy to scoff a block without trying at all we left one sitting on the kitchen bench and the young gentlemen have been scarfing it downidea a lindt  fruit and nut block thats something id like seei looked at your close up picture before reading the review and thought milk chocolate  a shame then i read the review and see that its supposed to be dark i think theyre pushing the boundaries herehi christine it is dark well darkish its definitely better than a milk choccy but even darker would be even better
when i opened up the last box i got in the mail i found some special edition raspberry variations on  musketeers and these two mint ones one is a  gram  to go and the other is  grams being about half the thickness theyre both in two pieces presumably for either sharing or saving half for later but i imagine most people will just eat through bothwhen you tear open the light green and silver wrapper a good strong mint smell is instantly revealed the nougat is white with its minty friend but somehow doesnt seem quite as soft as usual its just a little chewier the  to go is thicker so it has a greater abundance of fluffy white in it leading to a slightly different experiencebasically its just a bigger version of a peppermint pattie but theres still something very appealing in the coolness of the mint with the light and airy yet firm nougat of course  musketeers loves to talk about how it has  less fat than average of the leading chocolate brands not that theres really too much chocolate in here anyway even though it isnt at all a new idea the inside does get a chance to come out more since it isnt pressed flat and thin like a peppermint pattie so id say this is worth seeking out on the candy shelvesi think dark chocolate and mint is the only way to go to be honest milk chocolate and mint is too cloying i wonder if well get a version of this in australia as part of our milky way rangeexcellent photo with the mint leaf there
i picked this up because i dont often see pear chocolate and because i liked the sound of the caramelised nuts but when i read the back of the packet i found that i was also in for some apple and pineapple fibre as well as the  pear puree and pieces of pear i can only guess that the pineapple fibre was there to hold it all togetherits a little odd on the palate this one id have expected the chocolate to start melting a little quicker than it did but perhaps the fibrous extras and the fruit content make the process a little slower what you do get is an almost immediate blast of pear flavour then the chocolate starts to kick in alongsideonce it gets going the chocolate melts pretty quickly and soon i found myself munching on a combination of pear and nut pieces which were eminently palatablea very enjoyable bar this one reminiscent of summer afternoons in england which probably arent that much different from a winters day in qatar after alli couldnt tell you if carrefour france sell this you can just make out qatar only stamped on the box but if they do its one to keep an eye out forthey do have them in france i got one from the champion supermarket which has carrefour products tho i dont know if carrefour owns champion
the first thing i need to tell you about these rice krispie squares is what came in the box along with the free sample pack kelloggs were kind enough to send me a press release written on edible paper a chocolatescented candle in a tin a bag of marshmallows and a chocolate fountaina chocolate fountainas an impartial reviewer i feel its my duty to let chocablog readers know about this kind of thing and that it wont affect my review in any way oh no honestwith that out of the way have i mentioned how much i love kellogs lately lets get stuck inthese are a new take on the old rice krispie squares that have been around for ages and that kids have been making at home since the dawn of er rice krispies probably theyre exactly the same except completely covered in a chocolate flavoured coating with a few small chunks of milk chocolate thrown in for good measurethe chocolate flavour coating is very sticky and tacky there is a very slight chemically taste to it and once youve eaten it it gets stuck in your teeth for about  weeks its almost impossible to get any sense of the quality of the chocolate and there is real chocolate in there somewhere but frankly it doesnt matterthis is a snack rather than a proper chocolate and it doesnt pretend to be anything else the kind of thing you buy with the intention of putting in the kids lunch boxes but end up accidentally eating yourselfdom the boxes were a nice little surprise werent they i must say my review followed much the same lines as your own they arent the greatest chocolate item in the world  but you cant argue with their snackability  is that even a word d have you experimented with your fondue yet mine is still sitting on my desk  i am not quite sure what to do with it yetjimwell i guess we dont always need to be classy all the time if you need something to scoff then these look like a pretty decent way to gomaybe you could do a separate story on how you got the chocolate fountain to workive not experimented with the chocolate fountain yet i think i need to wait until i can get some friends round or take it to a party as it takes more chocolate than i can eat on my own it definitely deserves a separate story though maybe a video 
david jones is perhaps the poshest of australias department stores with their food hall nearly as legendary as harrods  brushing aside their specialist butcher baker cake selections delicatessen greens sushi and salads are naturally their chocolatesill save their truffles for another less hot and melty day because this time djs sleekly innocuous gold boxes grabbed my attention  not because theyre particularly enticing but because it seemed like a better way to take home chocolates packed snugly rather than rattling around in a paper bag rapidly getting squashed and drippy in my backpackthe blurb on the back of box emphasises that the white chocolate contains  minimum cocoa solids the milk chocolate has  and dear old dark has at least   it was also nice to read that the box is made of breakdownable earthfriendly materials and that even the plastic tray inside is made of vege matter that dissolve quickly  so quickly in fact that there were huge holes appearing within an hour of us opening up the boxlook at them  arent they lovely with their colouredchocolate paintpredictably my husband love chunks and daughter sapphire chose the moment of opening to stubbornly hang around insisting on trying their share  batting them away i managed to try the mint first the one with the green leaf which was a pleasant truffle inside but could have been a bit stronger in order to cut through the chocolate  the strawberry chocolate was sensational and it was easy to taste the real fruit inside  the nutnougat crme the one with the white swirl was also very very nice  having had my first three selections as dark ones the fourth was the milk chocolate coffeewalnut  this was also particularly good and made me note that it would be worth finding out if david jones do this in dark chocolate as wellso a bit of a mixed bag of different flavours  and success rates  to try but we did find some some real winners in there strawberry rumnraisin nougat and cherry that wed like to buy more of individuallymaggie just hint very loudly that some djs chocolates would be nice  especially when they come over to visit  of course thatll mean that youll have to repay the favour with hotel chocolat treats for them but then if youre family hopefully therell be sharingi haunt my local djs chocolate section quite a bit but have never seen these are they actually at the counter with all of the handmade ones and not on the shelveschristine theyre not at the counter with the gorgeous home made truffles theyll be another review  or seven  entirely but with the other boxes of chocolates including other brandsthe shop assistant who sold them to me said that a lot of people buy the boxed version because it looks nicer than having a few dented truffles rolling around in a paper bag and they are easier to give as gifts i agree with both of those statements and think the plain gold box is rather elegant now if i can just convince them to fill it with the strawberry centresi also wish that sometimes it would be possible to buy a box full of just one favourite flavour i can do this at haighs or swiss glory but a box of cadbury roses for instance has to be taken as is theres no chance of getting a box of the strawberry creams or the lovely new flavour in the mix lemon cheesecake
i really like the coloring of these piece bags though the design is only soso turn the bags over and youll find the words chocolate for those who appreciate the everyday joys of chocolate well im all for eating chocolate everyday but this could be worded a little better it sounds more like its calling this everyday chocolate not worth more than thatto start with the size i think the pieces should be just a little bit smaller for melting purposes the size combined with the square shape is too big to fit comfortably in your mouth without really lending itself to eating in two parts but thats a minor complaintback to shape this is the same milk chocolate as the bar form but its amazing how different the solid shape makes it just like in hersheys kisses yes many of my complaints still apply but the overall effect is much better the caramel and light chocolate flavors have a greater place in your attention with the slower melting from the increased thicknessthe dark chocolate turns to a thick smooth liquid like dove galaxy chocolates which though some like i still find a little weird it tastes pretty black in its darkness isntead of having cool flavors working in but ill admit that it isnt as frighteningly sweet as some alternativesmy point the thing that makes these better than the bars is their shape so if you like those youll definately want to try these out if youre pretty indifferent to them youll probably like me find these mildly enjoyable in their own way its still the same stuff though so if you hate the bars just dont botherive tasted them just once and it took my breathe away never had anything like it that looks so hard outside and yet melts like butter in your mouth
of more interest to chocabloggers well this one in particular is their range of handmade  chocolates some of which  come in quite unusual shapes their menu has over fifty different chocolates to choose from and they are all available to buy in the shopsi tried seven different chocolates  specialities of the house and evenly split between dark and milk chocolate with one no chocolateno chocolate how so like thisboth tasted superb the sweeter creamy nougat cream melted away and allowed the darker fuller cocoa flavoured truffle to take over there was an excellent balance between shell and filling with the milk chocolate finishing things off nicelynext up was this whisky truffle  in the shape of a hat yet more ethereally light and mildly alcoholic mousse enrobed in a sweet full flavoured milk chocolate  not as remarkable as its predecessors but nonetheless well thought out and with a good balance between the chocolate and the fillingthe final milk chocolate was this horses headhowever what i found was a thick white cream filling very much reminiscent of the long gone frys chocolate cream and infused with banana the cream filling was very sweet but as it melted away and the banana flavour faded the dark chocolate base remained to finish the mouthful off with its delicious bittersweet cocoa noteslast up was the diamond a dark chocolate shell with a light whipped centre the filling is once again as light as a feather and its life on the tongue so brief that i just wished i had more of theseoverall a great selection of very well made chocolatesgold pralines use callebaut belgian chocolate to create their shells but the fillings are obviously the product of czech chocolatierswell worth a visit should you find yourself over that waythis store is just one of the many reasons id like to visit prague again and again and again  i absolutely adore this placedroolim drooling with dom and when prague was mentioned i just knew it was simon who was the lucky chocabugger tasting themthe shapes and flavours look so uniqueoh my god it looks very delicious i want some i havent been to this store so ill probably check it out soon
based in indianapolis endangered species chocolate esc was established in  to increase awareness of endangered species and the need to do more help support the efforts made in their conservation  esc ethically source their cacao from familyowned sustainable forest plantations and pay the growers a fair priceunusually there was no inviting dark chocolate aroma when the wrapper was openedeven more unusually the dark  chocolate with raspberries was surprisingly bereft of taste  if forced to wear a blindfold and have another tasting battle with ashleigh again id be confident that neither of us would be able to guess what kind of dark chocolate it was or what the tiny chewy and dry things were scattered inside it  there was no discernible flavour whatsoever it was like sucking on something sort of melty and moist but that was itthe milk chocolate with cherries was a much nicer offering  very smooth creamy and sweet with a clear emphasis on milk  the cherries unfortunately were few and far between and had no discernible taste whatsoever  they could have been pgymy currants for all my tongue could tellits sad to hear that these chocolates didnt manage to deliver in flavour what youd hoped kathfor charity chocolates like this to work the effort really does need to be put into making the chocolate something that people will appreciate if they dont people will buy once and see it as a donation if the chocolate was to actually impress the end result would be a whole more in donations as it became something people really cravedyour job is great i would love to blog about food one dayi couldnt agree with you more michelle  if the product isnt good enough to justify the premium price  donation then it wont be bought again so it really needs to be of a quality that will make the buyer want to actually eat it again as well as assure themselves theyre buying something fairah meji  here i sit all sweaty after an eight kilometre run  this job does have its health hazards you knowits all about the  bar with the panther on the label
the addition of a subtle ginger warmth is a pleasant touch too putting me in mind of a wintertime tea drink  the zingy citrussy flavour compliments the dark chocolate very well indeedmy only gripe with this bar is that the lemon pieces are plentiful and quite hard and bitty leaving you with a mouthful of little hard lumps to tackle they do eventually soften and break down but after enjoying the flavours of the chocolate i personally found the mouthful of bits a little offputting im used to dolfin blending their ingredients to give a totally smooth mouthfeel and a mouthful of fragments was mildly annoyingnot the best dolfin bar ive tastedwowi just love the lemonchocolate combinationbut i agree with youits annoying when all the chocolate melts upyoure left with lots of lemon particles hanging around in your mouththats the reason why i never melt this kind of chocolate with my tongue but rather finish it with my teeth till the very quick endthis is very interesting as we made lemon truffles for the first time for valentines this year they were a hit the recipe called for the bits of lemon to be left in the ganache but our chocolatier my wife sandra decided to strain them out before putting the lemon into the ganache the dark chocolate and lemon was a most unusual and satisfying taste though the lemon outlasted the chocolate by a few minutes i was trying to find an ingredient to counter the lemon and ginger seems like a great solution cant wait to try it httpwwwdivinechocolatenetvideovalentinehtmli like chewy bits of lemon like that so this sounds like the bar is right up my alley i have got to find this one

this chocolate has a superbly soft mouthfeel soft sweet creamy chocolate with a generous sprinkling of crispthis chocolate has a superbly soft mouthfeel soft sweet creamy chocolate with a generous sprinkling of crisp nutty cocoa nibs which are packed full of rich cocoa flavours and are a personal favourite of minethis is a nibbling bar  something to eat slowly while savouring the flavours its so rich that more than a couple of chunks at one sitting can turn the whole taste experience from pure pleasure into mild overdose queasiness i really enjoyed the overall flavour combination of cocoa sugar and nibs and of course extra points are scored for organicfairtrade credentialsapparently blakes have secured a distribution deal with john lewis so uk readers should have little problem locating this and the other bars in the range and id say it was well worth seeking outsounds quite nice  ill pop into john lewis tomorrow and see if i can find it there any idea if its available anywhere else in the uklooks like it is not available here in the usoooooh cocoa nibs  you might only be able to manage a couple of squares simon but i reckon i could go a few rows without any hassle
dagobas beans are sourced from costa rica dominican republic ecuador peru and madagascar and schilling ensures that they are farmed organically sustainably and a fair price paid to the farmers and invested in their communities  sounds good doesnt itwell ethics or not the chance to eat some chocolate laced with hemp seeds was too good to miss  the  cocoa content wasnt too shabby either and we all know that pumpkin and sunflower seeds are immensely good for youother ingredients include evaporated cane juice instead of sugar balinese salt for ethical reasons and in their words love  awwww bless their sweet little heartsi even sat there on a c day outside waiting patiently to enable each segment to soften a bit so that the flavours of the chocolate could more fully emerge and reveal themselves but nope there was literally no discernible chocolate taste  it might as well have been now brace yourselves carob  yes carob  it felt like chocolate and clearly help bind the assorted seeds together but there was no cocoaey tastethen i tried putting it straight on the tongue and hoping it would dissolve into the taste buds directly but it just didnt  this was proving to be very very puzzling and disappointing  therefore my suggestion is that you can buy this bar in order to try nibbling on some hemp seeds and for good intentions but do not kid yourself for one second that the actual chocolate is going to be anything other than an invisible let down  sorryive found all the dagoba bars to be very hit and miss though ive yet to be disappointed byt the xocolatl or the lavendar as a fellow aussie though id love to know where you found these my experiences with dagoba occurred when i was in the us and i didnt realise they could be found here tooi like their chai bar which is milk mostly because its not strong on cloves but theyre pretty stingy on their inclusions dagoba has been owned by hersheys since  its under their artisan confections brandim very partial to their roseberry which to me is one of the best chocolateraspberry combinations out there  but i suppose thats partially because the chocolate flavors are pretty mild and the raspberry flavor is excellent and authenticinteresting to read this one as ive been tossing up whether to try this brand out or not a little on the expensive side  ok if the choccies worth it thoughi might give rebeccas suggestion a go and try the raspberry one and heres me thinking that dagobah was the planet yoda came from is geek dpity the chocolate doesnt taste good oh well back to the green and blacks for guilt reduced choccysthanks kath  i might have to get in touch with you about secret spots for chocolate buying in melbourne if i manage to make the trip over there this year i believe i tried most of dagobas flavoured bars when in the usexcept the ones with crystallized ginger as i love ginger as a spice but not in that form and agree with cybele that some are very stingy on the inclusions i remember tasting no mint or rosemary in the bars that were meant to have those flavours and nuts are always few and far between however the two that i will keep buying are the lavendar bar odd because i dont actually like the smell of lavendar and the xocolatl bar  but i love chilli in chocolate and nibslongtime lurker ahoythey may not keep or travel well i havent had that one yet but ive been very happy with all the ones i have so far as long as i dont lose them behind something else in the fridge or get them too close to expirywell some chocolate just doesnt have it  dagobas milk chocolate hazelnut and their mint dark chocolate bars are very good
its quite common for readers to get in touch and suggest we review specific chocolates but when two readers separately suggest the same chocolate with  hours of each other then its probably time to give it a tryof course the best way to eat a bar like this is to break off a small chunk and let it melt slowly in your mouth unfortunately the shape of the squares dont make that particularly easy but it can be made to break into nice bitesized chunks with a little persuasion from a heavy blunt objectthis is a  dark chocolate from mexico the box describes the flavours as complex but the first thing you notice is well not much at all  as it melts the sweetness and fruitiness become more noticeable but theyre still not particularly strongthe chilli flavour is also quite subtle and takes a while to come through when it does you get more of a gentle warmth than a kick and its actually quite pleasant as a result after initially finding this bar a bit bland i started to find it more and more moreish the more i hadto be honest i didnt particularly like this one a bit too well indifferent if you ask me as spicy chocolate goes id rather recommend the hotel chocolats  with chilli and pink peppercorns althoutgh i reckon this might be a bit too strong for those whove never tried a chilli choc before montezumas  chilli choc is almost equally delicious and not as punchymaggie i agree to some extent but i know that at least one of the people that asked about this is new to chilli chocolate and thorntons are cheaper and more accessible than something like hotel chocolattheres not a lot to it but i dont think itll put people off chilli chocs either  as i said i found it quite pleasant once i got into ittasty with a twistcan i have one plzzz
time and time again ive walked by this range but i finally picked up their  barthe ingredients  are also interesting cocoa mass beet sugar soy lecithin and vanillathe fifteen smooth squares have a beautiful shine and a healthy snap initially you get dark cocoa flavors in a texture not exactly grainy but more dusty because its still of a fine consistency then i got worriedthe flavor played on the hinges of boring blackness for a second it was also much sweeter than id expected its melting pace is very nice though neither fast nor slow but just right perfect for chewing a little and letting the pieces sit in different place of your mouth unleashing a bolder flavor this is where i started to really enjoy it is it a red flavor no not exactly berry no is that the beet sugar no that cant be it though it is tied in with the sweetnessthe more you eat the better this chocolate tastes its a cross between a munchy chocolate and a fine chocolate which makes it a good bridge as well as a good cause also not too expensive for having all those good causes being  gramssmap deanna i ate and wrote up a review not yet up dom hint hint for their dark with raspberry and milk with cherry flavours
like so many chocolates its touting something special or healthy  in this case sweetened with fructose ok fine and the importer is eatrite australasia hmm again but i dont care in this case they can write what they like and besides im just being really picky the lady of the house is off watching doctor who and im eating this holex chocolate i think i know who is getting the better dealactually i really like this one i cant see the pack lasting long now if youll excuse me i think i need to munch on a couple more rows and then go hide this from the kidsi love the photo of the chocolate squares ashleigh  very very delicious magazine in my opinion ive never seen that brand before but  is just the ticket when you want to eat more than a couple of squares of dark without losing your eyeballs salivary glands or will to stand upexcuse me while i grab my housekeys wallet and go in search of somewe love your site   chocolate lovers in miamii have a confession i ate half the pack in a single goif you eat just another couple of rows you wont have to hide any at allitll be gone
i picked this bar up in ms simply food in marylebone station without even looking at what it was i  was in a rush and could tell from the colour of the wrapper it was something i hadnt reviewed before it was only when i looked at it on the train that i saw the word marzipan in big lettersive mentioned before that im not that much of a fan of marzipan i think it belongs on christmas cake and should stay there rather than inside my chocolatethe dark chocolate here is  cocoa solids and although its quite sweet its really quite pleasant not that theres much of it of the contents of this bar is almonds and thats just nuts hahahaluckily its also quite light and not too sweet and that makes this quite a pleasant little snackthis is still the kind of bar thats going to appeal to marzipan fans marzifans rather than chocolate purists but i enjoyed munching on this with a nice cup of tea this more than i expected to im no marzipan convert but i quite liked thissince im a big marzifan im going to try this out  thanks for the reviewhi dom  has my pun training thats a pun too in a subtle way  seeing as you found this in a train station oh dear been rubbing offseriously though it seems like there is marzipan and marzipan some is so strong the bitter almonds that sherlock holmes and watson wound come across now and again that its almost inedible unless your genes have favoured yousounds like you found a good one  which is something ive still to findi love  marzipan and wish that it would emerge from underneath the icing on wedding cakes far more oftenespecially if coated in dark chocolate
so what are les coeurs i wanted to know what would i find in the boxthe answer folks is thisi actually sat and looked at this for a minute or three impressive design four forty gram chocolate hearts with brightly coloured shells hiding under a plastic cover striking is a word i might use to describe thema sniff at them didnt give much away a hint of citrus perhaps rich cocoa flavours most certainly but the true contents are an enigma there is nothing to inform the potential consumer as to what they are about to eat in short galler are so confident about the quality of their product that they dont feel it necessary to tell you what theyve been up toi had a small its a shame to destroy these lovely looking things moment and then went straight to the yellow heart this was the one that had hinted at some prior involvement with a lemon and was selected as being potentially the mildest of the four what it turned out to be was in fact white chocolate with a coloured chocolate covering and a very distinctive citrus tingle to it the lovely thing was that the citrus zing worked to counter some of the sweetness of the white chocolate mellowing the mouthful into a more lemonsandcream experience i found myself reaching for more but overdid it a little and found myself missing the benefit of some of that citrus best enjoyed in small nibbles so as to appreciate the subtleties of the added flavourthe orange heart turned out to be a milk chocolate orange heart but i had a feeling i was in for a slightly more upmarket taste experience than that of the well known foil wrapped orbsthe chocolate is a strange hybrid beige colour and the orange flavour is much more pronounced than the lemon was in the yellow heart its very sweet and packs a powerful tangerine punch that lingers on after your mouth is clear of chocolate  fans of chocolate and orange will love this its fresh and fruity and the tangerine flavours work well with the underlying sweetness from the chocolateluckily the red heart wasnt loaded with strawberry flavour what it did have was masses of rich semidark cocoa with a slightly sweet topnote presumably from the coloured chocolate coating think of rich dark drinking chocolate with a dash of cream stirred in and youre getting close waves of rich but mellow cocoa semisweet and hugely moreish very edible indeedthe purple heart seemed to have a light blueberry sort of flavour on the outside but the flavours of the chocolate soon took over soft in the mouth this particular heart was bursting with citrussy high notes slightly more bittersweet than the red heart and not as creamy the cocoa flavours had more depth and less sweetness and a god clean finishmy own problem now is four broken heartsfantastic review simon loved reading the journey you took me throughwow that really is a beautiful work of art that box and its contents great descriptioni drooled onto my keyboard as i read your reviewsigh are they available in canadayou are so lucky but i do hope that your loved one didnt get this particular box as a gift afterwardsthat is one beautifully presented box of choccies love the clean simple design very classy chocolate makers take note
a  gram bar sells for  which isnt too bad considering some of the money ive spent on quite ordinary chocolate products lately but theyre selectively located and have to be sniffed out fairly carefully made using dark chocolate that contains a minimum of  cocoa solids and not containing any dodgy ingredients was comforting to read on the back of the wrapper as was their claim that they use using good old queensland north east australia ginger from buderim the ginger capital of the land down underas you can see it wasnt your usual candied or jellified ginger pieces in chocolate but a buttery sweet dark truffle centre  i somehow managed to control myself and continued to read what the inside filling consisted of before eagerly eating it up  ginger pulp cocoa mass cocoa butter milk sugar thickened cream citrus peels sultanas and ginger powder  this was sounding even better containing real ingredientsand it is with great relief and joy to report that it tastes delicious  the crack of the firm dark chocolate outer layer reveals a softasmousse centre that has a very distinct and welcome ginger kick that fans of the root spice will love  there is also a hint of fruit cake in the mix whose flavour emerges after the sensuously soft filling has dissolvedill be honest  i chewed through the first bar too greedy and giddy to let anything melt but the second bar i ate more slowly allowing flavours to gradually dissolve and give my titillated tastebuds a real work out  this really is a treat and ill be adding it as an essential regular on my chocoshopping listoooh oooh oooh oohh want wantpantsso kath where do you get it fromi found it in an iga supermarket and have also seen it in david jones they are very very nicethis sounds fantastic will be near a david jones tomorrow tooand yes got one today and can confirm that this is one tasty baroh yes i love these  they used to sell at the local indie cinema received one last week for my birthday absolutely amazing  i need to go buy one this afternoonits so gingery when you taste it you have a feeling the ingredients are different than so called chocbars its rich and delicious people who have weakness to ginger  youll love it
of course the first thing youll notice is the rather smart box they come in its simple elegant and very very pinkinside we have  pretty heartshaped chocolates each sitting in a little paper tray like the box they come in they look simple elegant and quite deliciousthese are quite big chocs and as you can see the milk chocolate is nice and thick this means that you really have to bite through the chocolate to eat them and i found that the liquid caramel had a tendency to drip out when i bit into itthe caramel itself is quite sweet but doesnt have much of a caramelly taste the raspberry is subtle but it does seem to come through above any flavour the caramel may have had thankfully theres much more chocolate than there is caramel and its rather nice its  cocoa solids and has a nice flavour that you can actually taste even with the raspberry and caramelthe final piece of the puzzle is the freeze dried raspberry pieces each chocolate is decorated  they look great and again have a subtle flavour which grows over time as they melt in your mouthat  for  chocolates theyre excellent value as valentines gifts go and im quite sure they would be appreciatedthey might be lacking the wow factor that id be expecting from a valentines day gift but they sure are nice enough for a bit of prevalentine selfindulgence they have another advantage too at  you can buy  of them for the price of one of the bigger hc offerings and give them to  different peopleim fairly sure that increases your chances of getting something in return theyre just so damn pretty and cutethese look really cute a great valentines day gift for sure if you dont mind the dripping caramel  theres nothing better than milk chocolate with a little something extra  caramel is a perfect combination  i once had this chocolate and caramel dessert i believe it was a pudding of some sort and they added just a touch of sea salt in the center  i couldnt believe how much the sea salt enhanced the flavor  i couldnt get enough of it i wonder how it would taste with thesethis loooks soooo goodi absolutely adore the raspberry caramel bombe can somebody please please please tell me where i can get them from when it is no longer valentines season
the only valentines day part of this is the heart box since these are regular ghirardelli offerings also keep in mind that theres also a red heart which has different flavors in it not too fanciful but theyre still goodtasting simple delightsmmmmm id love to try the peanut butter ones ill have to check to see if theyre available in australiavery nice i want to buy for my ex girlfriend
so what do we get in the shiny tube shiny chocolates of course filled with one of three different vodkas  plain lemon and raspberryi discovered two ways of attacking these the first involves a little patience and a gentle tongue and i allowed the shell to slowly melt before the vodka flooded out and mingled with the melting shell the second method involved cracking the base off and necking the shot before enjoying the shell on its own im delighted to report a complete lack of any sugar shell by the way great newssince all three have the same chocolate shell i thought it best to look at that before going into the different vodka flavours its borderline dark we still need that percentagedarkness chart and has a good sheen to it its a little sweeter than i expected but i suspect that is in some part to counter some of the tang of the vodka as a precursor to the vodka its very pleasant melting just slowly enough to allow you to savour some of the deeper flavours once the vodka is released though you wont taste much else for a few seconds its a good sized hit as wellthe neat vodka is of course just that like it or dont like it simple asthe lemon vodka is a little sweeter but does add a satisfyingly zesty citrus burst a quite pleasant surprise and one that won me over quite quickly the raspberry vodka also added a lively fruity note to the proceedingshowever of the three i found myself liking thew lemon the most lemon and chocolate arent often found in the same mouthful and i rather like them as for the vodkachocolate pairing  well you either like vodka or you dont and if you dont then these arent going to appeal at allif you do like the idea of vodka and chocolate you could do a lot worse than these theyre strangely moreish particularly the two fruit flavoursi must say the thought of vodka being paired with chocolate does seem a little jarring perhaps as a nonvodka fan i should give these a missafter the first few you probably wouldnt carei dont know kath im a fan of vodka and chocolate but just not together mind you its been a long time since ive tried the combination and it was that awful suger shell type the lemon vodka one sounds like it could be interesting thoughme and my friends enjoyed chocolate vodka shots the flavours vodkas went down very nicely could anyone please tell where i may buy the elizabeth shaw vodka shots from have try tesco morrison etc no joy anyone got any ideas thank you
i love my local foodland store each visit turns up something new or unusual they have the usual selection of cadbury and lindt but its the selection of other odds and ends that i look out forwhich brings an interesting diversion aussie bodies was founded by steve outtrim  one of those internet  dotcom millionaires who used to run a company called sausage software seems like he sold his sausage shares at just the right time  he scored millions the buyers of his company like many other buyers saw the value crash soon after instead of sitting on his dough he was overweight and found out about the high protein diets when he found how much protein powders sell for he decided it was a good business to be in seems like hes moved on and healtheries and aussie bodies now have new presumably common ownersthe packaging proclaims a fact file gluten free wheat free source of fibre no artificial sweeteners on the back is a rather twee statement simple chocolate bars provide an indulgent wheat and gluten free treat for any time of day yerrrrsssss but most chocolate is wheat and gluten free and provides an indulgent treat thats the point innitas you can see its another flat bar breaking it open which i had to do for the fans of dissection out there who chastised me last time i forgot this part the cherry insides are a vibrant striking red it looks like it should glow in the dark and the ingredients do list colour  checking that shows this is allura red fdc red  yumit sure smells good though the cherry aroma is strong and appealing and in spite of the brilliant red it doesnt taste too bad like the cherry ripe this has some kind of cherry and coconut filling which is not too sweetis it better than a cherry ripe dont know they are both good but them i am biased ive been a sucker for the cherry ripe since about age about the only really obvious improvement is to tone down the fact file and the health claims its dubious and easily seen through though admittedly anybody buying this for a snack will just guzzle it down without reading the fine print like i dowow thats so red it hurts my eyesnuclear red or atomic red something that must have been made in a nuclear reactor to be that red youd be surprised at where wheatgluten can be found wheat glucose is a commonly used sweetner in various products and wheat is common in a lot of types of additives to chcocolate ie gummijelly fillings not sure if the simple line is made in a completely gluten free facility thoughdid you buy this bar at a nuclear plantdid you insides glow at night after eating this ashleighive tried this one and quite liked it interesting point you made about the sugar i always prefer to eat things even health foods that have true ingredients rather than chemical additivessweeteners this is the reason i dont eat many health bars or snacks real sugars colours and flavours has to be better for you than the chemical alternativeshi river i quite agree id rather have sugar plants than artificial sweeteners chemical factory or butter animals than margarine plants  chemical factory the list goes onits the never ending list of health claims that i gripe aboutsome products are healthy because of no sugar just chemical muck some are healthy because of sugar and no chemical muck i could go on to list a bunch of other thingsid really like the makers to let the products sell on their merits instead of dressing them up with spurious impossibletoprove claims of goodness
one thing about these is their size they look and feel a little small for  grams because theyre much longer in comparison to their width than most bars the golden foilwrapped bars have the same print on them calling rocky mountain the peak of perfection in handmade chocolates i dont know if id go that fareven though im kind of in a must taste every kind of chocolate mood right now and therefore unlikely to be buying much chocolate ive had before the milk bar is an exception i usually only eat a little bit at a time but im still tempted to eat this whole bar its very creamy but not in a melty kind of way the light chocolate and caramel flavors speak the word confection in a wonderful language it isnt as greasy as some offerings but it could still be a little better on that scorefirst impression with the dark bar wow its blackrare to find such a dark color not meaning to say i think its a good color ive mentioned what i call the nesquik flavor here it is again thick gloppy sweet and black rather than a nice dark this one has less sugar but it tastes horridly sweet to me it was doomed as soon as i laid eyes on it i really cant each much of it main line rocky mountain is great for confections and i love them for that but run away from the darker offerings if youre used to another quality in the dark chocolate worldcomments are closed
the final valentines offering from hotel chocolat this year and ive saved the best well the biggest at least for lasti had no idea what was in this giant pink g box and i deliberately avoided looking at the description on the back so it would be a nice surprise the bright pink box is laced up like a bodice meaning rather than just ripping it open you have to undress itonce youve tugged at the heart strings as hotel chocolat puts it the box opens and youre presented with thisa heady blend of love and chocolate in a daringly flirtatious ribbontied corset just tug the heartstrings and slowly reveal a striking milk chocolate heart swirled with fruity twotone strawberry chocolate pressed with luscious kirsch truffles and pralines crunchy strawberry shortbread chopped hazelnuts and crushed meringue piecesyup that sounds about rightunfortunately and somewhat typically my heart was broken in two im not sure how or when it got broken as it was well packaged but that could be a bit of an issue  and it did spoil the wow factor a little but not muchthe important thing is how it tastes and i can sum that up in one word divinei simply love the strawberry chocolate a mixture of chocolate and freeze dried strawberries the aroma and flavour are chocolatey and fruity and incredibly moreishbut the best part of heart strings is that you never know quite what flavours youre going to get because its impossible to break off a piece accurately you always get a slightly different combination of milk chocolate straberry meringue or truffle so even a slab of this size never gets boringif you really want to make an impact this valentines day then i would absolutely recommend this but if you can i would also consider buying it from a physical hotel chocolat shop rather than online if you want to make absolutely sure that your heart doesnt get broken in the postforget love  id rather fall in chocolate was said by a young clerk in a candy storecafe named michelles in colorado springs in about   an older gentleman came into the store to buy a box of chocolates for his wife and as he gushed about her he asked the gal who was waiting on him whether shed ever been in love  the clerk answered love  forget love  id rather fall in chocolatethat store clerks name was sandra doolin known today as sandra j dykesdom  mine was also broken by the bloody postie colour me not impressed i definitely think people should take your advice and buy it from the physical storejimmaggie i dont know i think some people might question how you really felt if you gave them a broken heartjim i think perhaps hc need to rethink how they send these big slabs of chocolate out they look well packed but clearly its not enough for a solid chunk that bigwow wow wow im impressed regardless of whether it arrives in  one piece or two surely hotel chocolat could do with a review from an eager aussie chocaholic hint hint  that really is incredibly pretty nice to hear the taste is great as well yes kath would be an excellent reviewer and id be happy to help with any tasting involvedi have tried this and can officially confirm that it is indeed deliciousxx
i was in the department store david jones on a sweltering c day and in airconditioned comfort happened to find myself in their gourmet food halls chocolate sectionplus its my new local  victoria  the ingredients looked fine  sugar cocoa butter milk cocoa mass emulsifier and vanillin but i laughed at their suggestion that the bar consisted of sixandaquarter  servings of g each  then after looking at the price tag of  for a mere g their measly serves made sense  this stuff costs  for a mouthful or  per kilogram  this is significantly more than the standard luxury chocolate handmade truffles than generally retail for around  per kilogramthats big bucks for a small block  but was it worth the pricethe smell was a very sweet one when freed from the strong plastic wrapper and i was encouraged by the description as belgianstyle coverture chocolate  coverture is essentially good quality chocolate that is favoured by chocolatiers because it melts quickly and has at least  cocoa solids  the cocoa solids werent specified in this block probably because it was a mixture of milk and darkthere was no satisfyingly snappy thock sound when i broke off a chunk but im prepared to allow that the summer heat was more responsible for this than the freshness of the productmoral of this story  pretty local and pricey doesnt necessarily equal delicious decadent or deservedi am surprised by your experience i was introduced to the yarra valley chocolates during a tasting at david jones before christmas my wife and i enjoyed the design and taste so much that we purchased several for gifts and some for ourselves we particularly enjoyed the competing flavours of the milk and dark chocolate the gifts were very well received and we expereinced many compliments although i am not a fan of dark chocolate i found that the combination of flavours and the quality of the dark chocolate was such that i was left with no bitter after taste to each his own i guess
its actually a combination of a  dark chocolate outer layer a  milk chocolate interior and a central core of praline with piedmont hazelnutsas you can see definitely three distinct elements to this barwhen i broke a piece off for tasting the praline centre started to break down almost immediately flooding my mouth with  lovely milky hazelnut flavours and then as the dark and milk chocolate joined in i tasted good rounded cocoa flavours from both the milk and dark the cocoa flavours come through very well giving way to the hazelnut pieces as you finish each mouthful the centre is quite sweet but not too sweet and the chocolate has a good soft mouthfeel leaving the palate clean for the nutty finale it certainly changed my previous opinions of venchis ability to produce good qualityor even edible chocolateits a good balance of flavours put together very well and offered in this slightly jokey packaging premium quality chocolate offered in an unusual format  not the first or last time weve seen that on chocablog ehthis was bought in plymouth so they are available in the uk and ive seen them on sale in motorway services in italy and france definitely a good pick as a gift for someone with a chocolate and tobacco addictionit does look erm different ill definitely pick one up if i find one im no longer a smoker but i might give in to tobacco cravings once in a blue moon as long as the tobacco is actually chocolate im with maggie  id be better off falling off the wagon cigarettewise with these bad boysvenchi made exceedingly good truffles  the rum truffles i stock are absolutely divine you can certainly taste the rumhiregards

as you will see from the back of the pack there is information and ingredients listed in just about every language apart from english but it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that its best stored between  and  degrees doh also that the  is achieved from cocoa mass cocoa powder and cocoa butterthe surprises dont end there a chocolate must be awfully serious when the inside packaging is firstly a serious plastic tray and secondly comes printed with serious instructionson that inside packaging we have a graph showing intensity vs time with separate lines for cocoa aroma steadily rising bitterness rising quickly then very slowly increasing astringency bouncing around acidity rapid early peak then falling and rising slowly and finally fruitiness very slow rise this all seems frightfully scientific doing my best with a roughandready translationrecommendations for the tastingexcellence  is an exceptional highcocoa chocolate with an intense cocoa flavour the full flavour is made up of different components which unfold differently during the tasting see diagram aboveexperience the unique taste of this unusual chocolate aromatic cocoa in its original form with an intense degree of acid and bitter notes and hints of candied fruitto be able to enjoy this particularly cocoaintensive taste experience lindt recommends the palate gradually become accustomed to highcocoa chocolate first with excellence  followed by  experience the unique flavour of excellence  by using a small piece to break off and melt on the tongue a cup of coffee to accompany unfolds the full flavour particularly wellso after reading the instructions doing the translation yadayada the moment of truth arrived time to open the pack and see whats whaton opening we were immediately assailed by an intense cocoa aroma inside we have some very small squares bear in mind this is a  gram pack i broke a few squares off and then broke those into smaller pieces whilst the family have been moving gradually to the dark side they are not all content to much their way through a lindt  or  block like i am so i was gentle with themfirst reactions came from oldest son err tastes of nothing much well it doesnt at first the flavours build and so does the bitterness just like on the highly scientific graph after about half a minute there were grimaces all around this is just too strong for themthe lady of the house declared that perhaps this is one for cooking with sacrilege that amounts to swearing looks like i score all of the rest of the block for myselfmy own opinion is far more complex than that of the family this really is a very dark very intense very bitter chocolate the flavours start slightly earthy and then the complexity builds slowly over a matter of a few minutes so does the bitterness this is truly a masterpiece  to get something to  with only a tiny amount of cocoa butter and sugar to hold it all together and prevent crumbling but it is an acquired taste and is certainly not for everybodyas far as i know we cant get this in australia it seems to be readily available in france and germany and in england we saw it in harrods for a couple of pounds eachfinally a review of my favourite the best chcolate ever and a staple ingredient of my parents care packages from germany i do wish it was more widely availablei know they have extreme heat in parts of australia at the moment so i recommend getting a dedicated chocolate fridge  doesnt need to be as cold as your regular fridge and a small drinks fridge will sufficeextreme yes indeed  or  days over  degrees and about another  over  its been awful protection of chocolate a musti dont know about a dedicated chocolate fridge dom but i do hog the top half of the fridge door with my selectionsive heard from a little lindt birdie that the  will be available in australia soonish ive tried some  buds from belgium and they nearly caused my eyes to cave in so maybe having some useful tasting notes like the ones ashleigh had would have helpedi finally got a hold of one of these yesterday   and didnt like it it was too harsh for me with a blueberry sort of bitterness not unlike a cacao nib and i thought the texture was kind of weird a little too dusty which probably has to do with the high percentage but the other three bars ive had above  got around that problem just fineim actually online trying to source this chocolate if anyone has any suggestions i was clearing the supermarket shelves of this chocolate in austria last year when i had occasion to travel there a few times such a fantastically rich and lasting taste my preferred method is to break a square into  or  pieces and place one on the tongue then hold it against the top of the mouth while it melts my mouth is watering just thinking about itexplode your senses by drinking a decent red wine at the same timei like my chocolate dark and mysterious like i regularly have  lindt just found  in my local supermarket so crossing my fingers for the big one  before the year is out  deliciousi regularly have the lindt  and had been looking for the   finally found one and its definitely a challenge compared to the   i found that the  goes well with a sweet drink dr pepper is my personal favorite  as mentioned squares are smaller than the   i prefer the  thoughnote  last week i found new lindt  in the store  i really like it  it seems less bitter than the  and smoother in texture  give it a tryim also liking a ghirardelli  midnight reserve  a bit of a fruity flavori love this chocolate i love the way it gets cold in the center what is the secret do other people wonder like i do well i love those truffles so just keepm comingmy husband gave me darknoir what do you do with it i tasted it did not like it thanks lucy selleyou could always store it in the fridge while you think about what to do and pull it out as a curiosity for friends to tryi tried this wonderful chocolate recently and decided to order  bars directly from lindt usa it is excellent in my opinion what a wonderful deep robust flavor i enjoy a small piece with a cup of green tea it is a bit expensive at bar but it is so full of flavor that it is worth it since it is to be taken in small quantities each bar will last a bit this kind of strong full flavored dark chocolate is definitely an acquired taste and for the true lover of high quality chocolate i might even say that this is an adult chocolate not your kids mars barme my brother and my friend loved it the darker the betterthis is available in australia to buy at lindt cafes i got a bar from the lindt cafe in martin place sydneyperfect with a good whiskyi think im going to draw the line at even  is too intense for me the worst thing to do with lindt is to gobble the entire chocolate square in one gothe bitterness kills you instantly  i once read that the aztec emperors of the th century used to drink several litres of melted chocolate like we do with milk shake or hot coffee that gave them a lot of  virility and strength in warfare an overdose of chocolates can be as addictive as cocaine or other drugs  i dont know the verdict is too much chocolate bad for you i cant have enough of it most people i know hate chocolates im generally not much of a foodie but have a strange addiction to chocolates which feels overindulgent and sinful  i dont think i know of anyone who eatsdrinks as much chocolate as i do im also very surreptitious about it just when noones watching i can gobble an entire  g packet of chocolates in one serving i usually prefer dark chocolates in the range  i also like chocolate liquors on cakes pastries pancakes etc i dont know if im ruining my health but i just cant stopi loved it goes perfect with a single malt whisky or a freshy ground and brewed coffee
heres an interesting little bar from waitrose i bought it because its plain white wrapper stood out amongst all the brightly coloured bars on the shelfthe packaging itself is a bit weird  a rather strangely decorated sheet of white paper im not quite sure what the birds and dominos signify inserted into plain plastic then folded into a pouch that looks like it might contain tobacco most odd but it succeeded in getting my attention so theyre obviously doing something righti really quite enjoyed the flavours in the bar the cinnamon adds a warmth to the creamy  milk chocolate thats particularly comforting on a cold winters night like tonight it does become a little bit overpowering by the time youve scoffed half the bar though so i recommend just letting a chunk or two melt in your mouth slowly then putting it down for a whilebut the most unusual thing here is the texture i presume its down to the cinnamon but as it starts to melt away it becomes grainy its not unpleasant but i would have preferred something smoother that melted away more cleanly having said that the cinnamon flavour won me over so ill certainly be on the lookout for more from rococoperhaps the symbols on the packaging are hieroglyphicsmmmmmmmm cinnamona quick google search revealed that rococo is also an eighteenth century french art and design style with scrolls foliage and animal forms interesting to pair that with chocolate the packaging definately has a unique looki kind of liked the grainy texture  but then again im the girl who likes biting into cocoa nibs coffee bits and all that too so no surprise there love the creamy soft taste the packaging is a tad weird but it surely does attract attentionthe wrappers are an impression of some beautiful antique chocolate mouldsi love this chocolate better than the prestat cinnamon in my opinion
heres one of those curious things that you just have to try when you find it sitting on a shelf somewhere each of these three tins is supposed to imitate a dessert from a different country in white milk and dark chocolatestarting with france we have creme brulee white chocolate i really like the formate the chocolate traveler uses thick circles cut into wedges and fit into tins you dont seem to find much round chocolate minus d truffles of course the pieces are nicely sized even with extra markings for those who just want a small taste as far as this ones color its well different tancolored its kind of melty too which was consistent with all three of these it has more of a caramel than creme brulee taste even with some slight peanut butter taste the texture is a little like peanut butter too not exactly creamy but more thick and smooth its interesting but definately candy in my bookthe dulce de leche milk chocolate representative of mexico is a very pretty brown soft yet dark in its essence it has that strong vanilla flavor ive been finding in dark chocolates recentlyconcerning the whole milk thing the word imitation comes to mind especially just after the delaviuda truffles they dont quite nail that soft flavor herefor italy we have tiramisu dark chocolate coffee a hint of raspberry and sugar sit in amongst the dark taste i guess it tastes good but i always have a hard time with those dark chocolates that sit on the lukewarm borders between sweet and dear and deep and intenseso theyre interesting chocolates in their own way that is i hesitate to call them chocolates because theyre so sweet the eight dollar price tag definately approaches steep for just  grams but i guess thats because of the tins which i do love the tins by the way id say the same about the idea but i really cant since it wasnt carried out terribly well i dont feel each country through each taste that said theyd still be a nice gift being kind of fun but you know not as a chocolate lovers giftive had each of these flavors chocolate traveler is carried in our local trader joes store and love each of them especially the tiramisu dont know if a chocolate purist would approve but theyre definitely a treat and the tin is a real bonus  ive found lots of uses for chocolate traveler tins around the housetoo bad they werent much good based on the tins alone i would have been tempted to try themas i know dulce de leche is a typical dessert created in argentina who said that is a typical flavour from mexico theyve some argument which supports that thanks im argentineanjimena seconded even though i prefer uruguays conaprole ddl no way would i associate it with mexico i would have expected maybe something a bit more orangeybrowney tooi didnt even know it existed in mexico either to be honest this new mexican resturaunt has opened here in this town and the only thing there on the menu that resembles anything south of mexico is churros the owner had heard of ddl but only in his native country of brazildulce de leche in the uk can only ever be found in either thorntons new range of chocolates or in haagen dazs ice cream the best way to try it is to boil up some nestl carnation milk or go to south america yourself honestly it is much better as its own food than a flavour too how about chocolate flavour products vs their actual chocolate content and taste i am a native brit but ive been to uruguay through argentina hence why ive had a few of their different dulce de leche brands and seriously this is nothing like caramel texture and colour perhaps but the taste is much creamier and less sickly sweet dulce crema de leche is also nice which is the same but creamier vanilla tasting could be what it ends up tasting like but i think someone from south america needs to bust some ddl into the ukeuropean and australianus maybe market it is immensley popular where it is made and very good  so good i got a kg tub sent over recently yumthat reminds me  someone might want to review some of thorntons new chocolates i have some still here i wanted to photo before eating including the dulce de leche ball but i have yet to charge my camera and thorntons really isnt that bad buy one get one free   on the misshapes or mishaps bags at  grams or so  cheaper than hotel chocolat for sure the quality sacrifice is forgiven at the price differenceive tried all three flavors and really enjoyed them my favorite is the tiramis because dark chocolate is my passion but the milk and white chocolate while not really being my thing were equally delicious i thought the flavors were distinct and true to their namejimena it seems that dulche de leches origin is in argentina but its also popular in other countries including mexico also the flag on the tin is for mexico not argentinai think that jimenas point  as was mine  is that dulce de leche is just not a mexican thing and especially in this form you probably wont even get the real taste of dulce de lechemexico has a similar thing but i think that both jimena and other south americans would probably feel outraged at it being branded a mexican thing my girlfriend from uruguay also raged when she saw dulce de leche being branded as mexicani personally think its an odd choice  something more relevant to that country  say like tequila flavoured chocolate for mexico or something more identifiable with a country would have been a better ideayes the raspberry flavor is only from the chocolate it isnt an added ingredient and actually neither is the coffee even though that one is a tiramisu flavorit was nice to meet you at world market  as a fellow blogger i was excited to see your site  i look forward to reading more of your reviews
here at chocablog we dont have many rules one is that everything we review should be chocolatey and the second is that we try not to repeat each other by reviewing the same thing twicerather than send them back to psychic school i thought id publish both as it might be fun to get two different opinions see what you thinkas you can see the wrapping has been designed to reflect the contents a rich dark metallic brown foil with a matching paper cup reinforces the dark chocolate themethe cocoa content of the chocolate isnt listed indeed all i know is that fine chocolate hows the chocolate oh its fine makes up  of each rondnoir this isnt high class chocolate at all were talking vegetable oil milk powder flavourings and so on mutton dressed as lambthe outside of each ball is dotted with tiny pieces of dark chocolate stuff biting into it reminded me of the chocolate vermicelli you get on kids cakes it has an almost powdery dry quality to it and melts away pretty quicklythe inside is of course the classic ferrero wafery orb and within that we have a machineinjected blob of chocolatey creamy stuff which also disappears fairly rapidly taste wise it tends to hint at dark chocolate but is too sweet and lacking in really sophisticated dark chocolate flavours to be considered a top notch chocolatei can see why ferrero have developed this product and for those who love their rochers this will present an interesting alternative personally i can take or leave these  they dont have enough real flavours to excite my palate but neither do they disappoint by being overly sweet or totally bland theyre just well fine i supposethe usual ferrero rochers have never really excited me that much  milk chocolate a heap of chopped nuts a bit of wafer and what reminds me of a blob of nutella spread in the middle  still they look pretty and plenty of nannas like getting them for their birthdays dont theyhowever went ferrero put these dark delights out i was excitedthe blurb on the back of the box informed me that they consist of at least  of dark chocolate with the rest being made up of sugar wafer and hazelnuts  the total cocoa solids for each g ball is nearly  with the dark hard centre being   not too shabbyand as wed expect from ferrero they look pretty toooutside they look like dark chocolate truffles that are rolled and coated in those antsprinkle things that nannas yep again with the nannas like to put on top of their iced cupcakes  under the sprinkles is a thin layer of chocolate covering a slightly thicker layer of wafer before the teeth hit the buttery chocolate centre inside  however theres more inside the buttery bit is a coffeebean like dark chocolate nugget quite hard which means its the last thing left in your mouth and allows you to fully appreciate the sweet dark chocolate lingering lovingly behind  nice one ferrero  its like drilling down to explore the earths layers and finding a better level the deeper you go down  nine year olds charlotte and sapphire were equally as enthusiastic but sapphire did profess a preference for the original ferreros because theyre golden and much more hazelnutty  as for me i love these little orbs of darkness  i could quite happily scoff at least four and of course did exactly that with a hot cup of black tea or a freezing cold iced coffee  i hope they stick around and eventually overtake the nannafriendly the gold hazelnut onesthe image on the box is really scary  it looks like a sort of half open eye may you send me a free sample please thanksi wouldnt be surprised if these were made in different countries with ingredients from different sources  and different packaging even if theyre supposedly the same thingim not a fan of the whole ferrero rocher thing but decided to give these ones a try about a month back being a huge dark chocolate fan and all unfortunately these ones werent able to change my opinion a little but all style no substance i received some of these today with the instruction to review them for chocablog sadly  already done however i quite liked them as did the bbq guests the plain ole ferrero rocher thing is a bit tired now i thought they were wonderful when they first came out now they are a bit of a yawn the rondnoir is a bit like a grownups version the chocolate is a bit darker the flavours a bit stronger its clearly designed not to offend and as such it doesnt stand out as exceptional eitherbut given a choice id take these over the rocher any day and there are few left in the box so ill try another one in a day or so and see if the feelings then are still confirmedi love your blog i just had these today and i ate four of them without even realizing it  they are definitely better than the hazelnut kindand the textures are great  must not eat the other fouri love this its  wow love itsadly this year they changed the recipe replacing the pearl of dark chocolate with an almond not nearly as goodi love it  ferrero collection 
today must be silly day a day for leaping with delight at the thought of hopping into some frogs but not quite as the french mightchoccy froggys things come in bags from the supermarket for only a couple of dollars each bag has perhaps  or  of the little critters in itthe chocolate is unashamedly ordinary the finish is cheap and there are no pretentions here at all the pack even explicitly says its compounded chocolate no reading between the lines and figuring out that vegetable fat means compounded chocolate and its only  cocoa these are sweets for kids well ok for kids of all agesa dissection shows the inside is the same kind of sticky gooey stuff that so many sweets or lollies are made from but who cares you can still sit down being an unashamedly unpretentious froggobbler and go through half a bag without even trying is half a bag of frogs called half an army perhaps a battalion or a division silly things these collective nouns there is just something about these chaps though  when youve accidently polished off the bag the kids come sniffing around did you finish the bag of frogsive been looking for some delish chocolate frogs ever since reading the first harry potter book way back when thanks for posting about theseive seen the choccy snake version they have in the supermarket and have wondered what theyre like if its dreaded compound chocolate though i think ill passtheyre amazing hard to resistoh they are they are compoundedand yet despite the dreaded c word compounded ashleigh ate the entire bag by himself scratches chin thoughtfully so they must be pretty goodwell yes which just goes to show the contradictions i dont normally like sweet these are i dont like low cocoa chocolate these are i dont like compounded chocolate these areand yet i ate half the bag i was generous enough to share then the kids came looking for more i figure half a bag for me and half a bag for everybody else was fair that is fair isnt itashleigh that sounds like my dads kind of sharing one for me dad one for you brother one for me dad one for you sister one for me dad one for you me so by the end of the sharing dad would have three times as many fruchoc than we each hadthey dont look like frogs to me or maybe i just have a really dirty dirty mind pgreat site you got my loyalty
i picked it up because i dont think this is available in the uk i could be wrong of course  i dont browse for cadbury chocs and because it actually sounds rather interesting coconut nougat coated with cadburys dairy milk chocolate  definitely something dom could get his teeth into im sureof course i knew it was going to be sweet and that was before i saw that g of the g bar was sugar i also clocked bovine gelatine among the ingredients as well and that did nothing to sharpen my anticipation i can tell youif youre a fan of dairy milk and you like youre chocolate sweet youll probably find this very appetising regular readers will know that for me this is kind of the antichocnot my cup of chocolate tea at allcomments are closed
emilys claims to stand by pure ingredients and thats definitely evident here the dried cherries are nice and soft and moist with their sweettart aspects balancing well with the chocolate chewy and melty sweet and fruity the hazelnuts are crisp and clear in their freshness taking the lead while the chocolate acts as more of an accentit turns out that the cranberries actually have a less tart presence than the cherries they dont really get lost in the chocolate what with the nice tang they give you to chew on but sometimes it feels like they get pretty close to it i think i enjoyed the almonds as much as the hazelnuts the chocolate in them acts very flowing and gentlecomments are closed
im starting with the simplest of the three sample products theyve sent us this year caramel sweethearts are twobite pieces of milk chocolate flavoured with caramel and cherry powder and given a bit of crunch with the addition of small pieces of cocoa crispies and hazelnutthe g box contains  chocolates embossed with a design that appears to be roses and doves very romantic but what makes these different is the  cherry powder they contain theres no whole pieces of fruit just a sublte warm fruity flavour that comes out as the chocolate melts in your mouth its really rather delicious but doesnt overpower the milk chocolate notes at allthe final piece of the jigsaw is the texture the crunch is apparently provided by cocoa crisps and bresilliene hazelnuts  sugar but the bits are too small to get any real sense of what they are suffice to say the crunch is quite satisfying whether you decide to munch on a whole heart or let a piece melt away slowlywhich brings me to my final point about these theyre described as two bite hearts because theyre a bit bigger than bite sized  and probably also because you could break one in half and share it with your partnertheres a distinct symbolism when you sit there and break a heart in two in front of someone you love part of me thinks they should have just made the chocolates slightly smaller but then i remember this is hotel chocolat the evil geniuses of british chocolatiersthose heart shape candies look amazing and for this time of the year that is perfect even if the taste didnt come out right the look on those things are amazingi just cant stop salivating over any seasonal product by hotel chocolat whatever they come up with is just brilliant im waiting for my february tasting club selections  theyre adding some of those lovely hearts to it i hope the boys know about this they would be so ecstatici am so jealousand wish they were freely available in australia
strange how we chocabloggers seem to  hit runs of certain ingredients rather like the old clich about buses we wait ages for one and then several arrive all at oncethe chocolate itself is a tangy citrussy litle number with a smooth mouthfeel and good dark cocoa flavours camaya use belgian chocolate and this one is very smooth slightly woody and deeply chocolatey the cashewsesamecaramel addition adds an occasional hit of nut and burnt sugar to this mix this was one of those moreish bars ordinarily i manage to finish a review with no more than  of the barselection in question gone this slab had no chance  by the time i was done enjoying it and trying to describe it there was precious little leftits also very good value for a fine handmade chocolateim not sure how much distribution camaya have got in the uk i bought this from a branch of oil  vinegar as always a website is always a good start especially as camaya will post you their goods they also offer a pick and mix style build your own box of chocs service  well worth a looki love reading all the reviews for sesame chocolate as i think the combination sounds quite tasty i havent had any luck finding any and im tossing around the idea of just making some at home myselfoh god those look amazing i just might have to order some thank you very much for the daily chocolate tipswow i love cashew nuts and sesame sounds nice we wants it precious yes we do
classic or chunky theyre both good but to see it now available in dark chocolate  as homer says whoo hoothese are perfect  simply sensational  glossy attractively dark with a sweetly fragrant odour that hits you as soon as the packet is open  add to that introduction the perfect snap sound as each row is broken off and youve found yourself in snack chocolate heaven  kitkat have always done a decent wafer and this one is no let down  its cracklingly crisp and literally sings to the solid dark chocolate on the outside  ten out of ten nestloh i just love the dark kitkat im surprised you didnt have those in oz before well now youll need to make up for the long and painful absence weve had these in canada for years as well  delishi love that because of the dark chocolate it makes an already amazing chocolate bar seem that much higher quality yumoh id heard this was out but couldnt find it in my local coles last night when doing the weekly groceries ill be keeping my eye out for this onewhy have i not seen this in adelaideim a bit scared though  i was very excited when white kit kat came out because it combined two of my favourite things white chocolate and kit kats but it was awful i cant go through that disappointment againdee trust me  you wont be disappointedim only disappointed that we here in australia seem to be the last country on earth to get themwhere are these available i havent seen themme toojulie ive found them in safeway woolworths in  victoria which means theyre probably now also in coles then the entire nation i hopei thought these would be good but theyre horrible its the illusion of dark chocoloate  it tastes like wax what a tease dark choc is my fave when it tastes like real chocolate these are far from it im sticking with the kitkat milk chunky version  it still tastes like chocolate well what massmanufactured candy bar makers refer to as chocolateive always found the milk chocolate kitkats a bit too sweet so ill be giving these a trylooks ok in pic  but might be overly sweet even bitter will try if we can locate a few dark chocolates give me migraine headaches love it unfortunately i do agree wriver re kitkat mc ohhughugh just waaay sweet these days why did nestle change recipe must have okeydokey eat some candy folks verrry ood for us  lol growing up our grandparents owned a soda shopcandystore in the s  s  what a blast
the chocolate delivers the flavour of the cardamom almost before it hits your palate that unique almost citrus spicy tang is all over your tongue as soon as the chocolate begins to melt the trick is to start attacking the sliver of dried mango as soon as possible in order to allow it to ad its more subtle fruit flavours to the mix the chocolate is a rich creamy milk chocolate with a full rounded flavour and a clean finish inevitably youre left with the mango as a finisher and it works as an excellent fruity palate cleansera good mix of two flavours not found everyday and seemingly available by a chain of sorts well worth checking outoh it sounds so wonderful i happen to love both cardamom and mango so i bet this bar would suit me perfectly looks like ill need to pop into oil  vinegar shortly nuggs eh  sounds like a third nipple that most people wouldnt want to advertisethe chocolate itself looks pretty nice thoughwow im from guildford i shall definitely be keeping a look out for this 
christmas was a pretty quiet affair this year and i even asked that santa not bother paying me a visit  im old enough now to have the things i need and can afford the things i want when i want them and i dont want or need much anyhowthese are subtitled on the box the pleasure society the mind truly boggles the box also goes on to say a spicy love affair with chilli and rich dark chocolatesociety rules on role playing there are many ways to spice up your relationship one popular method is to write out your fantasies and read them to each other in bed heres an example honey lets pretend youre a courier and youve just received an emergency call to go down to the shops and pick up a box of chilli chocolateshmmopening the box reveals a dozen or so individually wrapped thingies which just increases the anticipationfinally when we get through the final layer of packaging we find the prizethey sure are not kidding when they call them bites thats how much you get from one of these still the trying is the ultimate testthe outside is fairly soft and melts away quite quickly the inside is luscious and the chilli gradually builds to quite a pleasant additionbut these little suckers are not half bad quite moreish perhaps that roleplaying has something to it after alljust eaten my lunch but got my apetite back againnowwhen i saw those little devilsthey look very tastylistenashleigha little cross section of them wouldnt be bad at allim more of a visual typehmmm ive had nothing but bad luck with newmans sadly every time ive bought them not this exact one but similar filled chocolates in this same packaging the filling has been really dried outstale im sure that theyre not normally like this as evidenced by this review must be something happening to them during transportation to my local store oh dont you worry ashleigh  as soon as the little one goes back to school nd of feb and counting ill be jumping right into the melbourne chocolate world 
my reaction a slight widening of the eyes and an instant calming feeling in my head i hadnt been too excited about the whole pecan thing many of my neighbors are overrrun with pecans from their trees so when they kindly give us a box of them they usually take quite a while to disappear abundance isnt always such a good thing but these the pecan itself is very soft and gentle appearing much like a walnut somehow the milk chocolate is of that breed that tastes not of sweet not of caramel but of chocolate i hate to call it light or anything its simply wellbalanced in its essence the addition of cocoa powder adds a nice warmth that reminds me of cinnamon completely wonderfulwhen i moved onto the milk chocolate covered graham crackers a little later i was initially disappointed that there were only five in the box i dismissed it though seeing that they are fairly big two and a half inches  cm long  thick too and rather pretty definately not stingy on chocolate here theres as much if not more of it as there is cracker now i was still thinking that this was a less than average idea but then i tasted one of them my reaction this time wow what do they put in here the dark milk chocolate creates an effect of vanilla cream in its symbiosis with the honey graham cracker as thats a very pronounced honey taste its crunch in between sweet chocolate quickly appealed to my kit kat weakness though being much heartier than a scantilycovered waferim impressed especially considering that i had a little bit of bias towards pecans and graham crackers and wasnt in the mood when i first tried them right from the plain yet vogue boxes to the last bite these have a life and expression all their own yet accessible to all i just love it when chocolate gets me all philosophicalcomments are closed
well imagine my shock when i saw this four bars of  cocoa luxury chocolate of course i had to be waaay over the other side of the planet at the time so i have no idea whether or not the uk or europe will see this but i took some heart from the fact that on the back of the box is written made by cadbury poland for cadbury trebor bassett which to my mind implies that there may be some chance of this being released into continental europe if not the whole union which includes england mr cadbury treborbassettas you can see from the pictures upmarket equals gold gold boxes gold bar wrappers gold foil  everything glows as you work your way to the barfootnote  im also surprised that the same company which has failed to produce anything new or original in the uk for quite a few years has released this into the middle east while the uk in particular has undergone something of a chocolate revolution cadburys seem to have done absolutely nothing in terms of producing innovative or exciting new products one would imagine that a company with a world class position and reputation would have been on top of the trend towards artisan made or higher quality products and responded accordingly with their own range of similar products instead i tend to think of cadburys as either resting on their laurels or sitting on their hands my own personal hope is that this is possibly the start of that response whether the desire to expand into the connaisseur market is there or even worth the effort is debatable but i enjoyed finding something this good from cadburys more like this pleasei actually found this bar in my local  pence store last week would buy this againplz give me the link to purchase this choclate onlinesoon
according to the packagingthe term drage from the french to dredge or sprinkle describes  the painstaking process of creating a coating layer by layer since only the very best will do these drages have been made for waitrose by a continental master confectioner using quality ingredients sourced from around the worldso now you knowfrankly i think its more likely that a marketing person somewhere just found a foreign word they thought would look cool on their packaging these are really just dried cherries with some flavouring and extra sugar dipped in chocolatethe dark chocolate coating is smooth and shiny thanks no doubt to the glazing agents listed on the ingredients but has virtually no flavour of its own thats probably down to the fact that its only  cocoa solidsif you let it melt away in your mouth eventually you get to a sweet sugary coating that surrounds the cherry but theres still no real flavour until you bite into the fruitthe cherry itself is quite tart and tasty but its very dry its almost crunchy rather than the plump juicy fruit i was hoping formy overall impression is that these are sweets rather than real chocolates im quite happy to munch on them but i still feel ive been conned by the pretty packaging with the foreign words i didnt understandcomments are closed
a week or so before christmas i went off to our local vietnamese butcher the vietnamese butcher is an offshoot of the local vietnamese baker logical innit and along with really good choice and good customer service they have good prices hence the visit the occasion was a prechristmas bbq with friends and i wanted some sausagesnow before you wonder if this is a review of sausages bear with me as i string you along  the meaty part is coming after buying them and few other odds and ends as i was paying i saw what was on the counterseeing as i dont read or speak any polish i really had no idea what i was getting myself into but even i could figure out the meaning of kakao on the label and the label does tickle my fancy a little anyhow o smaku waniliowym z kakao which just translates as vanillaflavoured cocoaso what on earth had i bought it turns out to be vanilla flavoured halva with coca powder more checking both using mr google and the back of the pack reveals this is a sesamebased halva  popular in much of the middle east and obviously in a few other places as well  such as polandbecause the labelling is all polish apart from a small amount of english id guess this is made for the domestic polish market the sticker indicates that its a special import so availability might be a difficult oneim pretty sure ive tried halva before but i dont know where or when so this was a bit of a novelty and opening the pack revealed even more of a novelty than id been expectingthe texture is both powdery and sticky at the same time  which is very unusual and until now something i considered impossible not unpleasant just unusual the rest of the family were fairly noncommittal about this one but in spite of the huge sweetness and barely detectable chocolatiness i quite liked itnot something for every day but an interesting and curious changeaaah halva its not exactly chocolate but i utterly love it the pistachio variety is my absolute favouritemy polish grandmother used to give me halva when i was a kid i loved it doubt i could manage much of it these days thoughwowi love halva very muchits awfully sweet but sometimes i cannot resist to buy itespecially the one with sultanasit would be interesting to try this cocoaone but i believe that the amount of cocoa should be a lot larger for the sesame not to overpower ithow can they put it in a purple wrapper if its not chocolate this is blasphemyi adore halva id love to be able to get it in a handy bar like this ive only ever seen it in delis in tubso smaku waniliowym z kakao means vanillaflavoured halva with cocoa those small oneletter words can be pretty important for the meaning i tried halva years ago bought it from the central market here in adelaide i liked it but after it was all gone i never had the urge to buy moreyes it is our polish thing but not for everyone for ex i dislike chalwa in contrast to my motherhey im addicted to this halva i eat it everyday i buy it in  oz boxes and it at least one a day i should to be fat but im not im still  and  lb my belly looks just a little better then before my addiction start  months ago this product comes from poland and sometimes isnt available then i make a ride around all stores in polish neighborhood in chicago to find at least one bar sometimes i cant if i cant i get halvasick i cant think about anything else than halva for serious its not so bad with me its not a cocaine but i prefer to have it daily at home i love only this one flavor there is few others some is good other not but the pest one is vanilla with peanuts raisins and cocoa powder go halva if you want to try proper halva then you need to get it from the kosher section of a supermarket or for an even better experience a proper jewish shop that stocks ithalva is great but youre only supposed to have a small amount of it at a time because it is sweet and sticky  it shouldnt be powdery though
i picked these up in waitrose just before christmas as i was looking for something new to try the simple black box managed to stand out amongst all the festive goodies on the chocolate shelf so i thought id give them a tryworse than that after just a few clicks i found myself staring at the administration screen for their online shop not a particularly auspicious startdespite the slightly naff branding and broken web site the chocs themselves look quite nice theyre clearly not hand made  each is a perfect sphere with a small flattened area to stop it rolling around theyre all perfectly dusted with a precise amount of cocoa powder and each choc looks identical to its siblingthe chocolate itself is quite different it has a strong dark flavour with very little sweetness and that complete contrast of flavours is what makes these interesting let one melt in your mouth and you first get the lovely rich chocolateyness followed by an intense sweetness when the chocolate breakspersonally while i loved the dark chocolate the caramel is just too sweet for me i enjoyed the first few but they quickly became a bit sickly if you like your caramel extra sweet and gooey then give them a go i dont think ill be getting them again but im looking forward to seeing what else g come up withgu with so called umlaut courtesy of the germans makes lovely desserts which are one of the best things ive ever eaten in my entire life but ive never tried their chocs ill pop into waitrose on my way home i gues have you not tried their puddings  mmmmmmmmmm the melting middle puds are droolworthy i have to stop now im dribblingi know they mainly do puddings but im not much of a pud person myselfi guess if you like sticky sweet gooey puddings youll like these what about brownies their brownies are gorgeous never tried the chocs myself but id love to ive consumed a few g chocolate puds of one sort or another in my time witness the large number of clear glass ramekins in my possession i seem to recall one or two of the puds being very easy on the sugar but incredibly rich toothe brownies are pretty good too  throw a handful of raspberries and some whipped cram at them and theyre even better
that aside i really enjoyed these they have a definite spanish flavor so they might not be for everyone if that isnt something you like but that was part of what won them over to me theyre sweet and homely bits of chocolate all throughthey sound a little like the mozart chocolate balls you can get from austria hundreds of vendors all claiming to be authentic i had some as a gift a few years ago and they were fantasticif only i could find something local that was similarand no chance at all of finding what youve found here down underi just bought the same thing at a local market from a guy that sells all sorts of treats from a van cant wait for my lunch break to give it a tryupdate i went i tried i conquered the chocolate itself is quite delicious very milky but youre right the inside is kind of greasy not half bad but not too special either
christmas  a time for giving then when the giving is over its a time for retailers to offload all their unsold stock yes even chocolate gets the sales treatmentwhat we have here are seven different chocolates  two white two dark and three milk the milk chocolate is  cocoa solids the dark is  and the white chocolate is white so there isnt any cocoathe second white chocolate promised to be hiding a rich chocolate ganache laced with coffee i was a little disappointed to discover that mine wasnt finished with a coffee bean but the photo suggested it was made of chocolate anyway the actual chocolate didnt really have much to offer in the coffee department there was coffee flavour but it was that generic muddy flavour that suggests coffee without really giving you the true flavoura square chocolate with a dominolike pair of spots turned out to be a sweet cinder surprise gianduja and cinder toffee  a slightly unusual combination given giandujas velvety smoothness and cinder toffees somewhat more brittle qualities the pairing meant that inevitably i ended up with a bittersweet selection of fragments to munch on as the last of the milk chocolate flavours died awaythe golden cone was home to the french swirl  an ultrasmooth praline bags of hazelnut flavour in a truly smooth milk chocolate still quite sweet but very familiar flavours and done pretty wellthe centre of this choc was going to be a new one for me  bourbon soaked marzipan in dark chocolate  what i found was  a thin sliver of soft marzipan covered in a thick bittersweet dark chocolate shell the marzipan certainly had an alcoholic tang to it but still retained a good deal of almond flavourand so to our finale as chosen by me the raspberry indulgent blended raspberry and caramel in a dark shell and to my mind this ought to have been the best of the bunchat first bite my palate was hit by the tang of raspberry and once my tongue found the centre the mixture of caramel and raspberry came flooding in the zingy summer taste of raspberry melted away allowing the burnt sugar flavours of the rich sweet caramel to finish off before the bittersweet chocolate ended the tastingoverall id say these were reasonably good inevitably they err on the side of milky sweetness which isnt surprising given that the uk are still a nation of milk chocolate lovers these are well worth the sale price of under two poundsavailable in sainsburys until theyre gone i guessi got  boxes of these in tesco after xmas  p a box the reason they were so cheap was because the coffee bean was missing apparentlymy boyfriend just brought me these from tesco should i be worried the coffee bean is missing on my ones too  what a disappointment not impressed also the nutritian info is no where to be found on the box god knows how much fat is in each one
sometimes i start off with the best of intentions but when it comes to the crunch or the chew my actions dont quite live up to my own idealsfor instance this lonely looking little bar of chocolate was once part of a pack i bought it with the intention of photographing a nice big pile of bars in an arty pose but alas this is all that i have left i honestly have no idea where the other nine wentno really i cant have eaten them all i would have noticedit tastes similar to a milky way although its possibly a tad sweeter and a tiny bit less fluffy than the real thing its not quite the real thing but once youve eaten  or  of them you dont really care if you like milky way youll like thisnutritionally of course this has no value at all the small bar size g is effectively cancelled out by the urge to eat all  bars in one goso there you have it its a copy of someone elses product has no nutritional value and will make you incredibly fat which is probably why love it yumi demolished a packet of these recently please review lidl jd gross pralines its a knock off of guylian seashell chocolates but it only costs  yeshow much did the  pack costi had to go and check the web site but theyre  for  sainsburys also do their own  pack milky way copy too moreish and not the sort of thing any selfrespecting posh chocs reviewer would be seen dead eatingaha so you too lost control and didnt manage to photograph the bar au naturel either 
when i bought this i actually thought it was hot chocolate it wasnt until i got home that i saw the teapot on the front and i thought i had examined it fairly carefully at least i was right about the chocolate partso this tea turns out to be a world market exclusive as well as a limited edition the box explains that its made based on the mayan approach to their drinking chocolate with mint added to the mix hence the spice the ingedients list black tea peppermint cinnamon cardamom chicory cacao kernels ginger and coconut coconut i guess it must have a purpose random as it seems to methe fifty natural unbleached tea bags give off a wonderful minty smell set in a black darkness when my companions unanimously decided that this seemed like a tea to add sugar to i added some to half my tea purely for reviewings sake because truthfully i usually think sugar tastes bad in tea i always drink it plain so thats just an odd flavor to me sure enough the sugar in cup a was a little too off base around the mint and the deepness of the various spices cup b naturally suited me much better allowing simply the flavors of the tea itself to come out the cinnamon and peppermint hit you first the chocolate seems to be in there mostly as an aftertaste but i really dont think i would recognize it at all if it wasnt in the name then i was also expecting from that something more spicy what with the story about the mayans and all there are nice warm spices but nothing spicynot sure what to think mayan mint  hmmm the mayans didnt use mint in their chocolate to my recollection  earl gray with hot chocolate is good thoughthe label reads peaceonearthtea and you thought it was hot chocolate  thats funny to meanywayi agree  i really love this tea but it is a little misleading  have you tried mighty leafs chocolate mint truffle tea  that one is really good
meet margot margot comes from slovenia and to look at her youd think she was a chocolate bar but margot has a little secret margot is actually a soya bar with coconut coated with dark compound not so appetising now is shethe taste of this bar is actually quite strange it has a sweet almost fermented taste to it not quite year old pot of jam fermented but a definite hint of that alcohollike flavour probably something to do with the way the soya is processed to produce the finished producti suppose if you were someone with food allergies or an aversion to real chocolate and a love of sugar then this might be the bar for you but it doesnt make much sense to me to sell this alongside proper chocolate products its well oddodd sweet and something i shall avoid in futurehisimonare you sure this bar comes from slovenia and notperhapsfrom slovakia since the words below the margot are definitly not slovenian but rather slovakian or somethingas a chocoholic ive never heard of such bar being produced in slovenia but i might be wrongit could be some new stuffpleasecheck it again since slovenia and slovakia are confused with each other too many timesregards from sloveniayou are right it is from slovakia  and i love this baror czech republik  is yummy love itthe bar is not slovenian not slovakian its czech i know it because i am czech and the language used underneath the margot word are in my native language neither slovaks or slovenians have the letter p and if you were in koice you were in slovakia not sloveniawellyeskosice is in slovakiaactuallyi havent found such place anywhere in slovenia and the name itself sounds very slovakiananywayif you come across sloveniayou are very welcomed to try some of our rustika or cukrek chocolates or dobnik handmade specialitiesim sure youll like them more than that margot mumbo jumboorion is czech company and margot is definitely a czech productit does seem to be made in the czech republic and distributed there and in slovakia but the companies involved are the czech and slovak arms of nestle  it doesnt actually contain any coconut just coconut flavour  the only chocolate in it is some lowfat cocoa powder quite well down the list of ingredients  i was sent it as part of a chocolate swap with a czech partner and i am very disappointed  even my dh who will eat almost anything with chocolate would not finish the barhello i am from czech republic and my name is margot soya bar with coconut taste dipped in chocolade nice to meet you i taste wonderfully and i am eated by dozens people in slovak not sloveniaand czech republic whats more i absolutely hate when people who don t know me badmouth me and i am not really so suitable for people with food allergies lactose chocolate  nuts and of course i don t speak english wellrecently whilst visiting prague my partner and i on a cold and snowy day decided to climb petrin hill we stopped off at a small shop to stock up on snacks for the trip i chose the margot bar thinking it was similar to a chocolate covered hobnob as it felt rather weighty after  minutes of  braving the chilling snow and climbing the hill we opened up our treats and to my absolute dismay had my first taste of the margot it was dreadfull to say the least it was like eating punishment pure unadulterated evil disguised as a chocolate bar it tasted like out of date rum and raisen dreggs from the cheapest ice cream factory floor i hate you margot you ruined my entire holiday i can still taste you now even after all the pork and pilsner well thank you so much for your tainted review how can a reader get an honest opinion of this bar when at the time of unwrapping the bar your mind was set for a sweet the margot appeared similar to the margot had no chance for a tasteful impressionand second the margot is disguised as a chocolate bar well then i guess you must declare snickers mars milky way and all the other candy bars that are covered in chocolate are pulling the same trick on unsuspecting chocolate lovers but lucky for you there is no picture of the margot bar on its wrapping so the illusion of a true chocolate bar lasted no more than a couple of secondsby the way i truly love the margot bar over any other chocolate or candy bar in the usa nowhersheys that is one putrid chocolate loved only be ones who grew up on this cardboardglue smelling flavor because there was no other chocolate choice around after growing up on european chocolate the popularity of hersheys in the usa completely baffles me anyone else detects the smell of vomit when placing a hershey bar near your nose  ughhtrue hate hershey kisses  smell like pukeits because of the butyric acid they use in the recipe we americans are used to it from our love affair with buttermilk even if you detest the flavor of buttermilk you will love it in pancakes and then when your brain stops telling you that the butyric acid taste is spoiled food you dont notice it anymorehmmm well i just bought a margot from a japanesepolish food shop in guildford  uk i also thought it would be like a hobnob covered in chocolate from the illustration but it wasnt it was much much better  i am currently an enforced teetotaler and i love the alcoholic smell and taste of this bar very unusual but i am going straight back to the shop and buying up their remaining stock to hand out to family and friends it was so delicious it never occured to me that people wouldnt like it so the reviews here suprised me it must just be one of those marmite tastes you either love it or hate it i love it thumbs up   when ever i come across a european deli in canada i look for this barme and my  daughters have just bought this chocolate bar from a pplish shop in st helens and it is and was the most discusting thing i have ever smelt and seen was scared to take a bite but we are now feeling sick so it does not have alchohole in it  at all  i bought it from slovakia and had one and brought it to dubai my son felt it had alchohole  so let me know pleaseno suad no alcohol unless some has formed after the bar is manufactured due to the filling having fermented if it contained alcohol in any measurable quantity it would have to be labelled as such in most countries where it is being sold i believe you can eat it with a clear concience and a clear headive spent a bit of time in the czech republic over the past few years as both a student and tourist and margot bars are one of my absolute favorite candies  i always make a point to bring some home with me  theyre a nice departure from the sickeningly sweet hershey reeses snickers and milky way bars favored here in the usagree  nice mild flavor not a lot of sugarits slovakian and its amazinga friend of mine in the czech republic sent me some of these i had no idea what they were and of course the only thing to do is dive in and try them absolutely loved them though the alcohollike flavor was surprising i thought they were very good if sweeter than i normally like and had no idea they werent chocolate until i found thisim from the czech republic and actually im eating orion chocolate now d its realy good how much do you pay for one margot in your country and just for information alcohol isnt in it its a little bit of benzine i thinki am a mountain biker i must say i prefer it for mtb trip i hate mars snicker etc reason is those bars are full of sugar and taste it as sugari have been to the czech republic many times and recently a friend from there sent me a margot bar in a package when i tried it i too noticed the alcohol taste so i looked at the ingredients quite far down on the list but not at the bottom was listed alkohol which im assuming is just the czech spelling of alcohol can someone explain this in light of previous assurances that there is no alcohol in this productmany  european chocolates have alcohol in them  not enough to get you drunk  you know kind of like rum balls  taste great love this bar  love the fillinghi i am from slovakia i was searching on line because ive lived in usa for last  years and i havent had any margot for all that time when i was growing up margot was my favorite treat i miss it and i wish i could find out where i can buy it here btw i am a chocolate lover i buy lind chocolate most often i like belgian chocolate too i cant stand hersheys  i cant stand chocolate that is not even a chocolate  rather just oil with chocolate flavor dove is all righti could send you some margots margot is original czech and one of the best thing i was eaten in my life ive had a margot bar just seconds ago that is thee worst chocolate bar ive ever eaten in my life it was like torture trying to swallow the first bite ended up throwing it away and the flavors are bewildering it really does taste like rum is in itoh wellthat was my first and last times eating that pjust eaten one that my beautiful lover brought back to england for me she is slovak wow sweet and hints of rum she loves them and i agree weird but wonderful  but i wonder if there is a record number eaten before a person is sickmargot is the best chocolate bar in the world i am shocked that there are people that dont like it i always buy so many of them when im in slovakiajesus
these individuallywrapped chocolates are actually a blend of milk and dark chocolate with  cocoa content so theres still enough to keep the dark side dwellers interested and it shouldnt scare off any milk chocolate fans either  cocoa farms own description of these ten gram barrels is pretty well perfectly written to attract any proud redwine loving chocaholic worth their salt or cocoa contentsun ripened vine fruit bathed in a bold peppery australian shiraz then combined with our rich blend of cocoa farm chocolate and crafted into a wine barrel shape to make them feel at home  very cute and very compellingthe ingredients are fairly standard for the actual chocolate part although being a more milky chocolate there is more sugar than cocoa butter  what impresses me more is that theyve added real australian shiraz to the mix as well as grape seed extract grape skin extract natural vanilla and shiraz wineinfused currants  nothing scary herehow do they taste delicious  as soon as the wrappings were off i could smell the distinct red wine whiff of shiraz and to my surprise the sweet and milkyish chocolate was an excellent pairing for the boozeblown currants and the fruitandwine effect might be lost if it was drowned in a darker and bitterer chocolate  i cant believe i just wrote thathowever if anyones wishing to get all silly known as tired and emotional here in australia on them youd have to eat more than even i could manage because theres only  alcohol per  grams  could be worth a try thoughi spotted cocoa farm chocolate in a little side street off rundle mall and bought a small bar of lime and chilli chocolate to try when i got it home and unwrapped it i was very disappointed to find the chocolate badly heat damaged it was very white dry and had no flavour left at all apart from the little bite of chilli i threw the rest away im willing to give it another try thoughthanks kath for your suggestion i followed it and many others but failed it seems as if although there has been a substantial harvest of north queensland cocoa beans all of the harvest is under contract to the australia cocoa company and they will not sell beans while i understand that most people are only interested in processed cocoa products there are those like me who are interested in the raw bean for its medicinal and health benefits once they do all there processing of the bean these benefits are lost it just so happens that the raw bean has the highest amount of cancer fighting antioxidant in the vegetable kingdom and other very benifical rare substances that are lost in processing
gingerbread cookies always seem to be a bit christmassy to me than mint flavored candy canes they are equally holiday but mint itself is around all year for me gingerbread only comes in once a yearthe ginger taste is dominant giving way to the sweetness of the milk chocolate which is the same one used before cinnamon lingers on as the aftertaste much too sweet and lovingly christmaslike for my original chaicomparison it wasnt until i looked back at the box that i remembered the espresso its flavor is in there but it sometimes gets more or less covered up by all the othersnot all frilly like some holiday offerings yet somehow i appreciate that here it lets you buy something sophisticatedlooking not saying i necessarily by frills that still tastes a little different starbucks is a big company i really like their coffee except espresso 
back in december i brought the chaps home from cricket and picked up a screw through a back tyre of the car of course we didnt find this until saturday afternoon when leaving out for a christmas function whats that strange clickclickclick noiseafter changing to the spare wheel on sunday we gave the wheel that id removed a jolly good cleaning because it was filthy with road grime and this is supposed to be bad for alloy wheels cleaning up a wheel covered in grime has only one outcome you get covered in it as wellanyhow all this led us to a trip to the local superhypermegamart discount department store to try and buy a brush made for cleaning wheels they do exist we didnt find one though but as happy circumstance would have it a detour via the chocolate aisle turned up something new kinnerton luxury dark chocolate it claims to be delicious for cakes and desserts which seems sacrilegious to me whats wrong with just plain eating italso the label proudly proclaims it to be free of nuts dairy gluten and eggs this then is one for those who have various food allergies and who cant eat almost all other products because most plain chocolate is processed on equipment that also processes chocolate with nuts eggs and so oninteresting this is an import from england  which means it should be available in the uk i think i vaguely recall seeing it in supermarkets therea check on the back yes i really am an ingredients freak shows that its about  cocoa solids and no milk how do they do it unlike many of the under  chocolates this is a nice satisfying dark colour and breaks with that nice satisfying crack when you snap a piece offso wozzit like then satisfying actually very nice not too sweet not too bitter melts slowly this compares very favourably with other good dark chocolates i still dont get the cakes and desserts thing perhaps they mean it to be used as a cooking chocolate but really that would be a waste ive gone through half a block since opening the pack and keep coming back for more and more and more its goooooooodhighly recommended and for those with food allergies who might otherwise not eat chocolate this one seems well worth considering check your allergy first and if the things not in it are your trouble then give this a gonow where did i leave that blocki have a number of friends who live glutenfree  thanks for the great tipyep this available in the uk although ive never tried it will pick some up when i next do my weekly shopits very nice stuff but youll find that most chocolate is gluten free  unless it has cereal stuff like wafer or biscuit crumbs in it so eat and enjoymy granddaughter loves luxury dark chocolate after dinner mintsi cannot get them any whereplease can you help me i live in milton keynesthank youpeter b taylorpeter  i live in australia and so the kinnertons products we can get here is very limited indeed i suggest you try the web site that dom has linked above maybe you can contact them and find who they distribute throughand enjoy bletchley park  you have a unique and fantastic place on your doorstep i was there last year envy envyhmm i wouldnt necessarily call it the careful chocolate company  rather id call it the discriminative one  being allergic to soy i have to avoid just about every chocolate on the market this includes all the socalled allergenfriendly ones that are dairy nut and egg freethey all contain soy lecithin i cannot believe kinnerton have not even cared to try it really stinks on their part to be honest  its not good enough kinnerton just not good enough  and its a real shame as i can no longer buy any chocolate that is safe for me that is australianmade except for the cadburys  old gold which works well for cooking but for tastesoy is one of the  possibly one of the  most common allergens it is a real shame that kinnerton just doesnt care about the soy issue neither does sweet williamand the worst part of all is that the soy part of making chocolate isnt even exposed i am sick of chocolate diagrams just saying we conch the cocoa mass and cocoa butter together to make chocolate and then add vanilla to flavour it  be assured they do more than that  they just dont like to have to cover up for their own weaknessmain reason has been because the medical industry continually claims that soy lecithin and soybean oil are safe for soyallergic individuals as they do not contain the protein from soy  this is wrong  i react to the tiniest amounts of soy lecithin and soybean oil im not the only one eitherthat being said there are some really good brands out there  amedei in tuscany is a gem for anyone allergic to soy as well as coeliac no gluten containing cereals nor soybean products are used on premises  they are among one of the best chocolate makers in the world  and worth the effort and price to order  i got mine from lariocomauthanks for sharing your products
im still not  convinced about vodka and chocolate either something about combining the two strikes me as a little unnecessary taking away from both rather than producing something new and harmonious im sure there are plenty of people who would disagree but thats the beauty of humankind isnt itwhat did you like the basic fazer chocolateis liqueur fills vodka cranberry original lemonlime kosher if so who gives the supervision the candy is yum so i need to know thank youhow many come in a package on averagethe best chocolate ive ever tasted
theres only one thing better i like seeing than chocolates on special and in large quantities like thisinside are sixteen beautiful chocolates that remind me of max brenners creations which are hideously expensive to buy whereas these little charmers are not  even better they are in four divine flavours  orange frute noir intense noisette hazelnut praline and cacao croquant which means theyre studded with crunchy cocoa nibs if youre a nonsophisticate like myselfsee didnt i say they were beautiful  plus theyve even made allowances for their philistine fans like myself and not only added an elegant gold letter to match the flavour but also put the description on each side of the row  nice work lindtstersas you regular readers know we chocabloggers have waxed lyrical about lindts  dark chocolate before and deservedly so because it is some of the worlds finest  well try multiplying that by four when each one of these marvels are eatenfirstly the noir intense  a fine dark circle covered in a thin but solid layer of  that breaks down to reveal a softer and more intense buttery filling inside thus creating two unique textures from the same baseso on to the third flavour  eclats de noisettes with very creamy effortlessly melty and fine hazelnut praline which i really enjoyed immensely which is rather unusual for a nonhazelnut fan like myself  perhaps being expertly enrobed in a solid dark  outer layer was the deciding factor  lastly but not leastly the cacao croquant  my newest and utter favourite  who knew that tiny slightly crunchy cocoa nibs could add a bit of fun and extra flavour  i hope that lindt release these nibs into larger portions such as their g classic block range  more is more i sayim glad you reviewed these ones as i saw them the other day and was curious didnt realise that there were  in the box though bargain adds to shopping list
earlier this year i was chatting to a chef about chocolate as you do and he mentioned william curleys name saying that he had a bit of a reputation as a chocolatier jump forward in time a few months and i find myself being sent to shepherds market in london to buy lightbulbs of all things as i strolled back through the quaint and very upmarket shops i walked right into william curleys mayfair storehurrahthis toasted sesame chocolate is just that  thin shards of  cocoa dark chocolate with toasted white and black sesame seeds simple in both presentation and content and yet also slightly unusual i for one hadnt come across any sesame chocolate before it has also won gold awards and its easy to see or rather tastewhythe chocolate used is wonderfully deep and dark in both appearance and flavour with citrussy highs and tobacco and wood low notes and when you start to crack open the sesame seeds the additional flavour adds a nutty kick to the whole taste experience the chocolate is smooth with a great mouthfeel and a clean bittersweet finish the addition of toasted sesame seeds may or may not be an oriental influence mrs curley is japanese and some of their other chocolate and pastry creations use wasabe and sake but its certainly an inspired oneyouve clearly found the michelen star of sesame chocs simon  even so it is a combination especially if the seeds are especially crunchy and sweet that works terrifically wellas an aside did you end up buying the light globes you originally set out for

this chocolate is very different from others ive had its cool and silver with a slight gray kind of bitterness the nutty taste soon comes in with dusty earthy tones then it gets warmer feeling incredibly soft as it slowly dissolves it ends with a hint of a red taste this is one of the very clean chocolates leaving only its memory and lingering flavors instead of thick layeringits described as rich and gentle at the same time without any harshness or astringency i think that gets right to what this chocolate is about you can enjoy its flavor by simply letting it melt in your mouth but not having to get all detailed in tasting it reaches its hand out to you instead of making you climb up to its heightcomments are closed
take pity on my poor little sister shes living in germany and pining dreaming of cadbury coconut rough without thinking i said no problem thats available in every supermarket in australia ill post some to you foolish wordssearching high and low reveals a problem the giant cadbury machine does still make and sell the famous coconut rough in new zealand and ireland drat no help at all here from a quick check on mr google and the internet i found i can buy it but the postage to australia will cost more than the block of chocolate i was not brave enough to try for the postage to germanyall this leads me to do a jeremy clarkson and ponder how hard can it be to make your own i think i have a method of making it figured out i was getting all enthused about trying it and then the lady of the house came home with a miniblock of whittakers toasted coconut slab so ill leave the kitchen experiment for another dayas you can see when they say its a slab they mean it id been thinking maybe this could be  or  squares or small segments but no whittakers seem to have the same approach to their small slab as their large industrial strength big brutesopening the pack led to great anticipation the first whiff on opening screams coconut in big fat capitals were off to a promising start this is a soft milk chocolate  getting it out of the pack for the photo was a bit of a challenge it would have been easy to push great ugly fingerprints in this does help though in cutting a piece off  and seeing what the inside is likethe ingredients list the toasted coconut as  and looking at the crosssection you can see they arent fooling around the knife cutting through makes a strange crunchy noise thats coconut were cuttingthe taste matches the smell soft sweet and lots of coconut that coconut is nice and crunchy as well so you get a decent texture to it i cut the minislab into a few pieces and passed it around the family are unanimous pretty good the lady of the house is most impressedafter wed tried a few pieces i left half the slab on the kitchen table where the two young masters discovered it and it gradually got smaller and smaller during the afternoonfor the coconut fans out there this is pretty good now to send a kilo or two to little sisive never had coconut rough and probably wouldnt as im no fan of cadbury but as a german id like to recommend romy coconut choolate to your sister she should be able to find it in most supermarkets ive definitely seen it in norma last time i was in germany unfortunately rittersport have just discontinued their rater divine coconut chocolate apparently it wasnt selling well  hard to believe i certainly had my fair sharejust being picky but whittakers is an nz company manufacture just outside of wellingtonanabels  if youre referring to the tags then thats my fault as per usual thanks for pointing that out oops perhaps i was not completely clear im in australia whittakers is a nz company but their products are readily available here which is fine because i rather like themthe cadbury coconut rough seems to be made by cadbury nz for the nz market but isnt exported  or not that i can find  apart perhaps from to ireland though the irish may well be supplied with it from somewhere elseso buying it requires me to do a mailorder buy over the internet from one of a number of nz estores possible but costs an arm and a legi love these  the best value and best tasting chocolate aroundwell swiss chocolate smashes cadbury without a doubt just across the border of germany there is amazing coconut chocolatewhittakers is great tooi am from india i just had one today well make it two bought it in an upmarket store was in bargain section two gm slab worth rs approx  they were just mind blowing hope to buy moreomg i had been looking for this for ages they only had it in new zealand before but im so glad its in australia now i had it yesterday and it was by far the best tasting chocolate i have ever had whittakers is a better chocolate than cadburys due to the higher cocoa content also you get  grams in their family block unlike mean cadburys who reduced their block sizes to  grams  i have now tried the cadburys version of coconut rough and it still tastes like they are putting palm oil into it  stick with whittakers for best quality
in case you hadnt noticed the world is currently freefalling into economic oblivion and shops everywhere are desperate to get us to buy their stuff supermarkets in particular are packed with special offers and cheap ownbrand productsbut if cocopia are going for the quality end of the market ryelands are definitely going for the bargain basement end so here we have a pack of five g bars of solid milk chocolate each in a fairly tasteful wrapper with a notsotasteful discount brands at tesco logo emblazoned upon it and all for just and unfortunately when you put a chunk into your mouth you can really tell its incredibly sweettheres also another flavour in there that i cant quite put my finger on its a slightly rubbery note that i think falls somewhere between party balloon and old lorry tyres its very strange and not particularly pleasant its not a strong taste but its noticeable even under all that sweetnessthe upshot is i cant recommend this at all its cheap but it also tastes cheapwe may all be looking to save money these days but chocolate is an affordable luxury if youre going to treat yourself theres no point in trying to save a few pennies by buying something that youre going to end up throwing away so dont buy thisdamn you call that cheap  grams for  id rather have cadburys dairy milk lots of places have offers on  gram bars and even the s are a standard pterrible go with their value chocolate  its like p for a bar or somethinglolthe strange thing is that i live in poland and those bars thankfully as i see from your review are not available in my local tesco or any other tesco ive visitedwhat are the ingredients any soy in itbrian  i honestly couldnt tell you without going back to tesco to checkcan i have this chocolate please i want this one think you be neffi bought this  coco bar at tesco and to be be honest its the best ive ever tasted veryvery good my son just came back from switzerland with what he claimed was the best but i prefered this jmhoim soldfastforward to   this stuff is still pretty horrid best bet would be to use clubcard vouchers to buy thorntons choclates  you get  worth for every  in vouchers resultp at tesco now for g of milk chocolate with hazel nuts it is incredibly sweet  but its ok for buying for other ppl just had a ryelands chocolate with hazelnuts delicious i love ryelands im actually eating it right now whilt watching waterloo road nd i got it from onestop for  sorry guys but i love the white chocolate version they do i agree this isnt the smoothest but is quite nice and tesco sell them for just pi loved rylands hazelnut but tesco seemed to have stopped selling it sadly anone knwo where i can get it
tasting timei was given three chocolates to try all of which turned out to be milk not dark chocolate obviously a language barrier there  perhaps i should have said black chocolatethey all come in very shiny posh looking silver and gold wrappers reflecting the premium brand status that chopin enjoys out herefirst up was this long thin stick which turned out to contain small pieces of biscuitthe milk chocolate itself is quite well rounded in flavour if a little on the sweet side i suspect arabs have a bit of a sweet tooth the small pieces of biscuit were very crunchy and did make themselves known adding a little sweet and buttery flavour to this onenext up i found myself unwrapping this silver ovalit was pretty obvious from the shape that i was about to sample something with coffee insure enough healthy sized fragments of dark rich coffee bean were lurking in among a creamy slightly darker tasting filling adding a crunchy counterpart to the buttery flavoured cream i found myself wishing i had a couple more of these to hand very enjoyablefinally i unwrapped this golden blockhere was the cornflake chocolate my friendly female assistant had told me aboutapologies for the poor photoas you can see just its a hollow centred chocolate filled with a stack of tiny flakes of corn i couldnt help wondering how theyd managed to put this one together the flakes were perfectly crispy slightly sweetened and satisfyingly crunchy melting away with the chocolate for a well rounded finish this was definitely the first time id tried anything like this and i was suitably impressedoverall i have to say that these are definitely chocolates for the sweeter tooth i havent yet seen any  or above arabic chocolate and i have the feeling that milk chocolate is the norm the chocolate itself is very smooth with good rich cocoa flavours but perhaps a little sweeter than some of the posher milk chocolates were starting to see in the uk and europe its not all style over content though and i think i might buy a few chopinn chocolates to take home for friends and family over xmasma salaamcomments are closed
the bar itself is rather attractive bearing as it does a sort of abstract monogram type design in the top left corner and a thorntons logo further downthe overall flavour of this chocolate reflects its aroma quite well its quite dark but with tangy slightly tart high notes obviously due in part to the balsamic vinegar the vinegar tastes never overpower the cocoa flavours and the overall taste is very much bittersweet woody and slightly tart with a quite bitter aftertaste due in no small part to the vinegar  but in a really good waywow thats eerie  i was considering getting this for my dad today and im glad that you think its worth buying as a balsamic vinegar addict i might have to give it a go myselfhave you tried the thorntons chilli chocolate bar yetvanessa given youre the second person to ask that in  hours i went and picked some up this afternoon
velvety milk is essentially cadbury dairy milk  cocoa content with a softer more buttery centre  but heres the kicker  it really honestly truly does taste more well velvety dissolving quicker than amy winehouses resolvethe indulgently praline initially interested me even less than velvety milk because im just not a big hazelnut and milk chocolate fan doms review also stated that it had an undefinable fake taste that caused him to believe that there were better praline versions out there  nevertheless it too was half price and worth a try and boy am i glad that i did  inside is the expected buttery praline pastelike stuff available the world over but this also had some finely chopped hazelnuts and tiny crunchy pieces of caramel coating which was very nicely done  in fact ill go so far as to say that this is the nicest milknhazelnut chocolate combination ive ever had so there dom  ive now learned that cadbury still has the capacity to make something extra special and i shouldnt automatically scoff and dismiss their stuff until ive given them a try  well done cadbury and i hope these two blocks stay in your range for a long time to comewe get these in the uk as mrlts and yes we do get the velvety milk onei kinda feel you were abit harsh with your view on cadbury chocolateits been around forever because its great chocolate and i dont think ive ever met anyone who has mocked italso the whole predictable safe as much personality and flavour as abthroom tile lol i dont think many would agree with that atall lol very odd sexcuse me alan i know its a bit late  years  but what is mrltsalan very odd is one of the nicer things ive been called  
i had thought he was happy to leave it in the pile of eurochoc waiting for his crazy father to photograph and review it imagine my horror then a couple of days ago to find the pack opened when i asked about it youngest son replied well it is mineive begged a stay of execution for long enough to dash off a quick pic though even this was fraught with danger i wanted a photo with atmosphere something to convey our southern hemisphere warmth and sunlight  what better than against the rosemary in full bloom youngest son promptly told me i was doing it all wrong so the photo composition is his fair enough i suppose seeing as i managed to extract it from his clutches for a few momentsthe torino is a fine swiss milk chocolate with truffle filling youngest son thinks its pretty damn good i found it to be very soft and very sweet there is a hint of nuttiness from the hazelnuts  and almonds  a check on the back of the pack shows sugar at the number one on the list and it does show the other one that stood out is hardened vegetable fat this screams compound chocolate at me and how is the vegetable fat hardened ill forgive these transgressions because its quite nice but because of the sweetness you really dont need more than one or two pieces at a time this is one for the kids and for those who dont like a dark chocolatefor those readers in europe who might have a chance of finding this give it a go  you wont find anything like it from some of the other big chocolate factories its not something id want every day but it does make a pleasant changenow i can undo the chains on youngest son and let him polish it offah youre a wonderful father ashleigh  i think youre right though  best leave the hardened vegetable fat to the youngstersi find swiss chocolate a bit sweet to be honest
i could easily do without the cherry cluster and dipped english toffee even though i like toffee but the dulce rose don juan pecan nuts  berries pate and sunset orange pate made up for that by far because the rest are also good though not quite as endearing to me and bring in some less common journeys in the taste world especially if youre fond of chilichocolate combinationsdeanna im hoping that its sea salt the caramel is dipped in and that no real seals were hurt during its makingthey all look and sound incredibly interesting to meoops typo fixed aw bugger  seal salt might have started a craze amongst chocolatiers wanting to create a new flavour  on second thoughts perhaps you did the right thing
tried to find some today in mk so popular they were out of stock   though they get them in tomorrowi work in a hotel chocolat and nearly everything is out of stock but these are certainly one of the favourites this christmas but a few people found it too sweet i do love these though nice review 
who doesnt like surprises pleasant ones anyway so how lovely to have postie knock on my door and hand me this box of fairtrade chocolates from plushas for the chocolates themselves the dark chocolate is a  cocoa blend the milk chocolate is a healthy  and the white chocolate is  cocoa butteron to the tasting thencranberrya dark chocolate ganache with cranberry was first choice the dark chocolate exterior was quite thin and delivered some very good cocoa flavours before melting away to release the delicately fruity slightly floral taste of the ganache im not sure id be able to identify it as cranberry but it was certainly a very tasty little number  very soft in the mouth and with a good clean finishcaramelthe first of the milk chocolates the caramel filling was rich gooey and not too sweet delicious flavours which blended well with the milk chocolate shell having disposed of the upper part of the shell and the filling i was left with a decent sized disc of milk chocolate to consider it had some very pleasant straightforward cocoa flavours nothing too complex but of course theres no need when the chocolate is being paired with a rich caramelalmondthis rather attractive leaf shaped milk chocolate began to flood my mouth with almond flavours within seconds of being eaten it put me very much in mind of a more sophisticated version of quality streets green triangle great nutty flavours and more of tat hearty milk chocolate taste delicious and very moreishhazelnut pralinemore nuttiness here with a crunchy texture hidden in the velvety smooth interior oodles of hazelnut flavours combined with the robust milk chocolate flavours excelllent mouthfeel and another smooth finishcoffeehaving disposed of the milk chocolates i decided to attack the only white chocolate in the box  a coffee creationgiandujamade with hazelnuts and almonds and topped with crushed caramelised nut pieces the gianduja was more than just a darker deeper version of the preceding two nut chocolates the blending of the nuts made for a more complex set of tastes more so when coupled with the nut pieces smooth rich and loaded with nutty flavours i found it to be so much richer than the other two and also a little sweeter on the finish due to the caramelised nut fragmentscoconutthe final flavoured chocolate was this coconut offering dark chocolate wrapped around a creamy coconut filling not as sweet as the sainsburys limited edition coconut bar i tried a while back and with more coconut inside it delivered masses of flavour which gave way to a lovely bittersweet finish as the last of the dark chocolate shell melted away its still quite rare to come across coconut chocolates and this one was a definite winner ganachefinally a piece of  cocoa dark chocolate ganache a chance to taste the pure flavours of the chocolate that had been used to wrap the preceding offerings had i saved the best for last it certainly wasnt lacking in punch a hearty bittersweet chocolate coating which revealed another supersoft ganache filling which was slightly sweeter but still reflected the prevailing flavours of the cocoa beans usedall of these plush chocolates had incredibly soft luscious fillings light flavoursome and bursting with cocoa flavours the choice of cocoa beans from the ivory coast means that the overall cocoa flavours are not too complex allowing the other flavours room to come through without any conflict on the palate my three cotasters all agreed that they would happily buy this selction either as a gift or a little indulgence and i would recommend them to those of you whod like a treat with a heartthis collection of chocolates will please anyone who enjoys a good quality selection and obviously being fairtrade you know that the producers are getting a good deal out of them as wellyumgood to see some nice fair trade stuff coming through after the recent divine fiascogreat article simon  i feel as though i was one of the friends eating through the selection with youi can taste them just reading your article where can i get some of these in australiaooooooooooooooooogeez these sound incredible especially the dark chocolate ones although a bit darker would be bettergreat articlei filled my gift bag with some gomerut oils and vinegars it looked great i was proud to give it to my friendthanks amigos del mundo for letting me give a  green  gift   no wrapping to throw away
hmm so what can i say about this chocolate kissing mistletoebut there is a deeper philosophical question that needs to be answered hereluckily for you in the name of science i ate all ten of the chocolates myself and suffered no adverse side effects and people wonder why im still singledom we need more active research from you try eating it outside your flat okay but there are laws against that kind of thingtoxic or not im simply loving these they look fab too although they normally wouldnt last long enough for other people around me to even sneak a peek at if someone fed me these and tried to lure me into any kind of indecent activity id probably say yes  just to get more i love ithii just enrolled in ecole chocolat for january cruoses and i would very much appreciate if you could write me something about your own experience therethanksdespina
it looked like a beautifully wrapped gift thats often seen on american tv but not in my real life until it slowly revealed itself to be in a much plainer box  not that its whats on the outside that countsthere were three layers of chocolates inside a very generous selection of white milk  cocoa solids dark  and bitter   this thin cardboard box was looking more like a treasure chest to my greedy eyesand yet and yet even after eating at least eight of them i found them a bit sameish for want of a better descriptor  just to clarify this i kept eating a few more the next day and the day after that to see if i could pinpoint why my reaction was such a fussy one  im nothing if not persistent about such important mattersthe one chocolate i had that really stood out was knossos a dark chocolate with a distinct and deliciously complementary flavour of tea within the ganache inside  this really could be in a box all on its own  granted too the selection is based on seasonal availability of ingredients so it was both tantalizing and disappointing to see gianjula orange marzipan cinnamon praline and liquid butter caramel listed in the assortment brochure but not found in the box  therefore maybe ill keep from announcing an offhand takeemorleaveem response due to my continued puzzlement as to why hazelnuts are the bees knees in the european chocolate industry and due to not having the more intriguing combinations availablegoing to have to get you some sees from the usa or deanna should do some perhaps ok  i could be convinced if the right belgian hazelnutty stuff came alongoh i cringe at the name of sees its horrible stuff but everyone makes such a big deal about it around the holidays it doesnt even look nice like these chocolates maybe i should do a review  possibly because hazelnuts are harvested in the autumnearly winter so are plentiful in time for the making of christmas chocciesif i were your friend jacqueline i would never ever bring you any present again because not only are you so critical of it but also seem very ungrateful not to shut up on that criticism afterwardsani i think the whole point of an unbiased review may be lost on you anyone that buys us chocolate as a gift knows very well that were going to say exactly what we think of it we do this so that you can make better decisions on what to buy and what to avoidwhaaat i cant believe this is the only mention of sees on your entire blog you even review hersheys but sees isnt good enough thats quite a low blow i think hersheys is a pretty rough go but i love sees especially the fact that you can custommake a box to have all your favorites im sure other places do this but sees is the only place that i know of in america that does itid give them a shot sometime if i were you id be interested to hear your takei got a box of the dark chocolate and the flavors were not in just the hazelnut family and really smooth and yummmsees isnt what i was talking about it was the corne port royal what is seesdoes anyone know if i can get these online and sent to me in australiasite you want people to read your blog and get that prioceus traffic flowing well rest assured because you are reading the right article to get your brain moving and to take your blog post writing skills to the next levelif youve never heard this before then probably
the wintermint bark is a dark chocolate slab with a white chocolate slab sprinkled in peppermint on top my companions all enjoyed it but there was something not quite right to me im going to attempt to explain the taste i picked up in it with the hopes that someone out there will know what i mean i call it a makeup taste and before ive only encountered it in mexican sweet breadive no idea where this taste comes from and while it isnt exactly unpleasant it isnt the nicest in chocolate either but that aside the dark chocolate is smooth with slight coffee notes the white has a nice bit of depth to it the mint though is barely noticeable again it should definately be stronger the packaging could always be a big nicer as well but it is handmade chocolatenext is the wax joyful hearth with sunset orange pate its labeled as dark chocolate orange ganache infused with chipotle chili and cinnamon hand dipped in dutch cheese wax this was my first wax chocolate experience its an interesting concept pretty and entertaining to peel off after you cut a piece the chocolatesmith markets it as weatherproof chocolate which definately comes in handy in the southwest and for toursits who arent always traveling in the best chocolate enviornments my first impression of this chocolate was something akin to fudge only nicer of course its very soft but slightly rough this one has a sweet taste at the start then a lemoncitrus edge before moving on to the warmth of the chili which flavor is the one in your mouth after it melts a bit spicy for the weaker palates a light touch for the stronger the fudgy chocolate taste isnt very dominant with so many other flavors but its a nice compliment to them nonethelessthe holiday tree is a plain dark chocolate pate it has a wonderfully enticing thick moist smell that reminded me a little of the joseph schmidt truffles the fluffy ganache has a reddish tinge and is still a little rough in the mouth although there isnt any orange in this one the chocolate still has a sweet citrusstrawberry fruitiness to its depthsim still puzzling a bit over the wintermint but the wax chocolates are amazing theyre truly something to touch both sides of the chocolate spectrum enough to enchant the chocolateobsessed but still casual and innocent enough to entice the average person or touristthey look amazingyes wax chocolates eh very cunning idea i wonder if well see anything similar happening here in the uk
be all that as it may its time for another sampling of the eurostash we brought back via trains planes yada yada we found the camille bloch kirsch in the a shop alongside a train station in switzerland the sort of place that sells newspapers magazines and in this case quite a nice selection of chocolate the price sticker is still in the back of the pack  swiss francs in australian dollars thats about  bucks for the  grams which is not doing too badlykirsch of course makes me immediately think of black forest cake especially the one we make about once a decade that includes a liberal dose of both kirsch and cherry brandy through the cream filling oops drifting away back to the task at hand besides my arteries were hardening just thinking about itthe packaging describes its contents in both french and german swiss milk chocolate with liquid kirsch filling and also highlights without sugar crust a method of making a liquor filling stay inside the chocolate so it follows that if this is made without using the sugar crust process it would be reasonable to expect the liquor filling to be less sweet than some other products because kirsch is a distilled spirit with no sweetening this is probably a good thing the less sugar in our kirsch the better on checking the ingredients list the kirsch content is  of the total no wonder it also warns in  languages contains alcohol no kiddingin spite of the vast distance being thumped and bumped in suitcases the contents survived their journey pretty well the milk chocolate is very soft and delicate the cocoa content seems to be pretty low its a long way down the ingredients list below sugar cocoa butter milk powder glucose syrup  and kirsch still nice thoughthe way to eat a piece is to let it slowly melt in your mouth suddenly there comes a burst and you are flooded with the sharp kirsch mmmmm that no sugar crust thing really pays off this is gooooooooodcan we have this exported to australia pleasegood news ashleigh camille bloch is available throughout australia at various outlets the importer into australia is premier food and beverages pty ltd in glen waverley vic their contact number is    they will be able to direct you to your nearest camille bloch hita long time ago i used to get dark chocolate kirsch batons without the sugar crust at the airport in zurich  they came in plain white boxes with no brand label on the individual wrappers and were unbelievably incredible does anybody know if they are still made and by whomi forgot to mention they were not lindt and they were smooth perfect cylinders without cocoa
ahhhh the beautiful familiar and yet still appealing aroma of lindts  was evident the moment the foil was ripped open  plus there was also an inviting whiff of something fruity and spicyinside the chocolate is a fine layer of mousse which ive raved about and enjoyed before and could quite happily do a bellyflop into  on top of this mousse is a thin orange marmaladelike layer of liquid papaya syrup infused with fiery chili  not unbearably painful sweatunderyoureyeballs fiery but enough to add an extra wow to the zesty zing of papaya and have the imbiber automatically reach out for morethis is absolutely terrific chocolate and i hope  please matt lovey puss sweetie darling sweetie  that it becomes available in australia and all other places its currently not available in  very soonpapaya or pawpaw is pretty readily available almost anywhere in australia but the best is found in the tropical north elsewhere it must be picked a bit early or something so that it can last the travel id imagine that in europe it should also be fairly readily available generally its a pretty subtle flavour but a nice change to the other fruit you get all the time
when i received this in the post recently i was immediately taken with the packaging design i love the colours and the overall tone of the wrapper its very caribbean with a home made feel and reading the information on the back told me quite a lot in not many wordsthis chocolate isnt just grown on grenada the whole process from tree to bar is undertaken by a cooperative its beyond fair trade if you will they even use solar power in their factoryof course any chocolate made from organic ingredients by a small producer isnt going to be cheap but this is pretty special chocolate the company have links on their site so that consumers worldwide can buy online or from local distributors which is a very canny move another special treat bar methinks but one well worth paying fori love your reviews of special bars like this onewow id buy it just for the gorgeous wrapper alone but when all the other goodly stuff is revealed i am even more enviousif dom does another round of chocsters  maybe this is a vote from you simonid say that was highly likely but there are always great and groovy things around the corner ehtherell definitely be another chocsters but theres a long way to go til februaryput it this way dom  i seem to hold my own personal chocsters at least once a week
well this looks to be the bar equivalent of that caffeineinfused bag of chocs in fact if you were to take a crosssection of the chocolates and the bar youd be hard pressed to tell them apart on looks alone so what we have here is a rounded bar of white chocolate sprinkled with cocoa with a coffee truffle centre it certainly looks quite temptingwhen you open the wrapper the coffee aroma is subtle but tempting and that sums up how the bar tastes too its much smoother and creamier than the individual chocolates and the coffee flavour and caffeine rush is far less intensei was a little concerned the white chocolate was going to be so sweet but because theres such a high filling to coating ratio it ends up working very well the truffle filling has a very pleasant cocoa flavour which works perfectly with the coffeeoverall its a pretty decent midmorning snack and something id definitely consider buying again so far ive been impressed with all the thorntonss bars that ive tasted and i love the idea of taking something simple like an every day bar of chocolate and experimenting with flavours im really glad to see that theyre coming out with interesting and fun new products long may it continuecomments are closed
this isnt a spectacular value at all ten dollars for fortyeight slighty bigger than quartersize chocolates is fine but not special the chocolates themselves are fairly average i enjoyed the canelle vanilla cafe noisette and caramel thats all not all palates around me were as picky though so i imagine these would be good for entertaining as the box suggests theyre pretty plentiful and edible but not worth extended attentionthanks for the heads up  they do look lovely but good to know i wont be buying a large quantity to find out for myself that theyre average at bestthanks a lot for this breakdown i saw these at costco last week and was tempted and am glad that i resisted the temptationi found this review astonishly inncorrect i love these chocolates i reccomend trying them cause everyone has different likes and dislikesi agree with kira  these chocolates are very goodi thought they were the most delicious and fun things imaginable the flavored varied along with the pics and description and therefore made it a fun thing to taste test with my friends i found it to be a true delicacy
when the wrapper came off there was absolutely no doubting the fruit content of this bar the pineapple smell was all too evident putting me in mind of those pineapple cube sweets i used to see in jars as a child naturally it was also the first thing i tasted as well but it was very quickly followed by a warming note of chilli which intensified as the chocolate began to melt as i allowed the chocolate to break down in my mouth the chilli just kept on giving  almost to the point of worry pretty intense chilli heat flooded my mouth but oddly enough it never obliterated the citrussy tang of the pineapple indeed the finish proved to be an equal balance between the two added flavours and as the heat died away i was left with a rather lovely aftertaste of pineapplehaving been a little worried by the intensity of the pineapple and chilli bar the sight of three italian chillies on the second bar had me pondering just how hot this one was likely to be  especially with no additional flavours on offer to moderate the heat of the chillias it turned out this bar was a little less intense as the first square began to melt i could taste a whole series of dark leathery woody notes with an undercurrent of nuttiness which actually gave way to  much lighter unexpectedly delicate finish at no time did i get the rush of  chilli that i had experienced with the previous bar rather it seemed to just be there as a delicate counterpoint to the rich flavours of the cocoa adding warmth and a little spice to what was principally a very good deep complex blendi thoroughly enjoyed tasting both of these but if i had to make a choice it would be the second bar primarily because stainers seem to have managed to enhance the flavour of the cocoa rather than putting something else alongside it which is the impression i got from the pineapple bar chilli and chocolate virgins would do well to seek out the stainer  bar with such an array of flavours and so delicate a balance it could well be the start of a whole new taste experience for youi do like the idea of chocolate with pineapple shame we cant get this down under leathery notes huh
it was my birthday on the day i visited so i just bought a whole assortment entirely based on appearances and the flavours that appealed to me  these included dark chili chocolate strawberry white choc lemon myrtle baileys irish cream champagne truffles mint truffles cointreau and peanut cupsinterestingly it is the milk chocolates that mostly win out here  actually to be really honest it is the white chocolate lemon myrtle truffle that is the stand out  it is the perfect combination of a hard outer shell and soft creamy flavour inside that would easily convert a whitechocolate naysayer  the milk chocolate peanut cups were also delicious  it wasnt a peanut butter filling but finely chopped peanuts that still gave a really fresh nut flavour and almost merged with the chocolate itself  the strawberry centre was another milk chocolate champion that was divinely pale and creamy melting too tantalizingly quickly  perhaps the only soso was the champagne truffle  yes it was milk chocolate but any champagne flavour was imperceptiblethe dark chocolates tasted as though they were all from the cocolat stable and their dark chocolate has a dull and stodgy taste in my opinion  the chilli was the only flavour that could quite literally fight through and leave a tingle  the other truffles were less successful in allowing their flavoured centres to escape the domination of ordinary dark chocolate coating the outsidewhat was most appealing was the sample of a layered marzipan dark chocolate crafted especially for their store by steven ter horst a chocolatier who has completed his training in france  his wares look as artistic as any by max brenner or marie belle and will be available at no in the new year  if they are all as good as the one owner sophie zervas gave me there will soon be standing room only at this establishmentcomments are closed
another from the stable of chocky that claims to be good for you this one came courtesy of the health food aisle in our local woolworthsthere seems to be a trend in making and selling things high in antioxidants its the new big thing  we have adverts on tv from a large multinational food maker for their coffee containing green beans because this blend is supposed to be high in antioxidants there are numerous other examplesthe aa fruit is supposed to make this even better but what the heck is aa fruit from the picture on the front of the pack it looks a lot like a blueberry a check of mr google yields an answer the aa  ahsaee is a palm that grows in south america the fruit is quite large has a big seed and is high in all sorts of fats oh and grapes have a higher antioxidant potency youd be better off eating a mango though in this case the aa is restructured which means the pieces you find are aa puree  apple and pear concentrate  cellulose powder palm oil and pectin hmmthe sugar free part comes about because the sweetener is polydextrose and sucralose aka splenda sucraplus e after reading the ingredients list i feel in need of brushing up my high school chemistry lessonsthe saving grace in all this is that it is  cocoa which keeps my dark side placated in appearence its nothing very special a blingfreezone moulded so you can break bits offin spite of the chemistry lessons it doesnt taste too bad it has a slightly bitter slightly sweet slightly fruity flavour and there is plenty of richness from all that yummy cocoa the fruity bits when you find them have a strange flavour that is hard to identify  not unpleasant just a bit unusual we shared this around among the family the consensus is that its not badyoungest son thinks its very good indeed the lady of the house found a slightly bitter aftertaste which i can also pick if i try hard my suspicion is that this is linked to the artificial sweeteners because of the similarity to the aftertaste with other artificially sweetened productssummary its ok but id rather eat something with a bit less pushing of its virtues and a bit more of nature in the ingredients listim actually a big fan of acai juice when i first tried it i had no idea what it was either but i just loved the taste its sweet and perfect it does seem like it would be a nice combination with chocolate even if this wasnt the best of attemptsdont get me wrong its not bad there are just other things i like more and the pushing of the health benefits seems a very big contrast to the ingredients list if i want healthy id rather be eating things with names i dont have to look up in a chemistry handbook my healthy might not be the same as everybody elses hmm it actually says anti ox on the front so maybe theyre really trying to tell you that no oxen or other beasts of burden were harmed during the making of their products  i keep listening to the news speak about acai so i have been looking around for the best site to get info
the blurb on the back of the package informs me that this bar has a mild balanced and refined taste and at  cocoa solids i was expecting something on the lighter side of dark if that makes sense one thing i couldnt help noticing was that this g bar also contains over g of sugar which i found a little surprisingthis bar smelled more like a milk chocolate with a light citrussy top note sitting above some pretty good woodygrapey undertones  as for flavours well i found it actually had quite a lot to offer a light grapey start with hardly a hint of bitterness that developed into a very lightly spicey cedary combination very soft on the palate and never bitter this proved to be a bit of a find albeit quite a sweet one i could probably get used to this as an everyday sort of chocolate although i think i might prefer something a little darker but for those of you who are slowly making their way into darker more complex territory i would recommend giving this one a tryan unexpected pleasure and at a bargain price ill certainly pop into aldi again for more of thisis this really from madagascarwould you know where one can get these choceur chocolates in perth we dont have aldis here in perth where can you purchase choceur chocolates in perth as we do not have an aldiim afraid youre likely to be out of luck as choceur seems to be an aldi brandi just bought three of these from aldi a madagascar  an ecuador  and a venezuela  interestingly i found the  to be the nicest followed by the  but i dont think any of them are quite as good as the moserroth  thats also sold at aldidkjfsdhrhkjhfs the packaging certainly claims it ishungaryforchocolate the packaging says choceur is a registered trademark of aldi and would seem to be their inhouse brand so its probably unlikely to be found elsewherethis candy is delightful preferable to higher priced chocolate and worth the drive to find an aldi store to locate it the packaging is beautiful and definitely not what one would expect in a discount market i would love to purchase this product online if it were available it is truly giftworthy and have many friends that would enjoy it aldi is a fine store and they provide a lovely assortment and presentation of products in a very attractive neat and organized fashion at such reasonable costs wish there were more markets and products available like aldialdi has discontinued the range of choceur single origin chocolate where can i get some still
this bar is eight squares of milk chocolate with peppermintflecked white chocolate layered on top the combination is fairly sweet and creamy with a smooth taste from the white chocolate the mint taste works itself into the overall flavor but is a littler lighter than id like it seems that it should make its presence a bit better knownalso if you crunch the peppermint pieces after the chocolate melts you fine that they have no taste at all themselves false covers the mint taste must come from inside the chocolate itself its much better to lightly chew the chocolate so that they work as a nice texture insteadim just a hairsbreadth away from disappointment i was expecting some stronger flavors here but after all i did say before that ghirardelli never does have much out of the ordinary still if youre looking for christmas chocolate this is a better choice than many of the things youll find in the average store it does tend to be a little addictivei tried some of this yesterday afternoon i really wish it would have been all peppermint bark and no chocolate i agree with you that theres got to be a tease in therei have had this too recently and the flavor really isnt strong enough i didnt realize the peppermint pieces werent actually peppermint though i can never let chocolate melt in my mouth long enough to get to just the bits i guess i will never be a chocolate reviewer for that reason pi offer a peppermint bark that has peppermint oil  rice crisps i find that the crunchiness of the rice crisps works really well with peppermint even though it doesnt add to the mintyness at allwas given a sample of this in the ghirardelli shop in downtown disney i found it very nice and bought some bars from walgreens cheaper i wish now i had bought home more i bought some raspberry bars but have now found out they are not vegetarian  couldnt find the mint cream bars
so as you might have guessed i particularly like thiswhat we have here is a large g solid milk chocolate christmas wreath thats been packed full of cranberries raisins pistachios and almondsmy photos dont really do it justice but to give you an idea of the size this is what it looks like when served on a large plateapart from the size the most striking thing about this is the colours the bright red cranberries and green pistachios are literally bursting out of the chocolate the chocolate pine cones and holly leaves cracked to reveal whole pieces of fruit and nut underneath wonderfulthe milk chocolate itself is rich and dark in fact at  cocoa solids its darker than some dark chocolates the  milk solids do soften the flavour slightly but not much it both looks and tastes closer to a dark chocolate than a milk chocolate but thats probably a good thing clearly this is designed to be ther centrepiece of your christmas dinner table under no circumstances should you attempt to eat it alone at  its not cheap but i still think its good value its a decoration as well as a delicious hunk of chocolate for sharing over christmasoh and its completely and utterly mad  a definite plus in my bookyum that looks both beautiful and deliciousand would make anyone a top christmas present hint hintthere are two problems with thatbesides it just wouldnt be right to send you half eaten chocolates and i cant afford to buy a new one sorry bout that just bought one in the holborn branch and i found out they have daily tastings at lunchtime too  a valuable information considering that i work literally  minutes away  but havent tried it yet  i want it to last until christmas and ill try to stop myself from opening it before that instead im just devouring the raspberry and mint chocolates from their selector stand delicious and surprisingly fruity giveem a tryim eating my chocolate wreath now its gorgeous
being a fairly permanent dweller on the dark side of the chocolate world i thought it was time to sample some of haighs quiet achievers the strong sellers that arent as glamorously wrapped as their celebrated dark chocolate creams or their giant gold wrapped frogs  yes im talking about the humble scorched milk chocolate almonds and sultanas that lurk in the shelves relatively unadornedhaighs milk chocolate  definitely some of the very best around  contains approximately  cocoa solids so its no lightweight  when this marvellous stuff is also generously coated over some really freshtasting and crunchy almonds the combination is a winner  i never thought id say this but ive tried the dark chocolate scorched almond version at  cocoa solids and actually consider that the milk is a better pairing these sultanas may remind me just a bit too graphically of my pet rabbits ahem bunny butt beans but im absolutely sure that they taste about a thousand percent better  haighs have chosen top quality juicy sultanas and as with the almonds coated them in their glorious milk chocolate which results in an ultrasweet pellet of pleasure  the only bad thing is that its too devilishly easy to polish off an entire bag and regret it afterwardsthe scorched almonds are one of my dads favourites  very close behind the choccie frogs always dark chocolate  of courseeating a whole bag of chocy sultanas is almost as bad as going through a whole bag of fruchocs very easy to do and comes with its very own special punishment the following day here be the voice of experiencethat is funny ashleigh  love chocy sultanas but yes in moderation
berry christmasthe golden inca berry is high in phosphorus pectin and vitamins a c b b b and b and for a fruit theyre quite high in protein  these vegan gems are also a good source of bioflavinoids vitamin p which contain antiinflammatory antioxidant and antiviral properties hardly surprising to find that emma has managed to incorporate another superfood into her range of chocolate bars but how does it taste as the raw chocolate melted away i began to taste a very citrussy mixture of flavours with the blackcurrants making themselves known almost immeediately because raw chocolate melts so quickly it wasnt long before all i had left in my mouth was the berry content and chewing up the various berries produced a very pleasant combination of flavours im not sure i could isolate the inca berries but there were definitely tangy naturally sweet and zesty notes overall very tasty and quite unusualcherry christmasa bar loaded with dried cherries  tart and chewy and bursting with flavour a riot of bittersweet cherry wrapped in the classic conscious chocolate house blend to produce a superb tasting treat anyone with a taste for cherries should definitely have a look for this bar it didnt take too long tat all before i was crumpling up the wrapper and popping it into the recycling honest emmamerry christmasthis bar contained pineapple and pine nuts  not flavours id normally associate with christmas see the recent cocoa bean christmas tree chocolate review if youre a traditionalist but when i tasted it i was intrigued by the combination of flavours the pineapple  which i had expected to dominate the whole experience had been used very subtly and in combination with the pine nuts gave a very soft smooth taste there were always notes of pineapple and it certainly made it all the way to the finish but it always sat extremely well with the lovely nutty flavour of the pine nuts a very moreish blend of flavours and again one i would heartily recommendcomments are closed
what makes this range unusual is that the cocoa comes from cacao grown in the far north of australia  which i would have thought is not tropical enough  but you live and learn and these guys have come from nowhere and dont advertisethe ingredients list gives the game away the chocolate is  cocoa solids the first and most prevalent ingredient on the list is sugar it also states that the product contains no more than  alcohol strange also that the blurb says it contains raisins and the ingredients lists currants along with the wine comes grape skin and seed extract no idea what thats all about flavourinside we get plasticfoil bag all printed with cacao pods or leaves or something looks good and has the practical benefit that its tough  so it doesnt tear and spill bits everywhereopening the pack reveals a block with the logo and name featuring prominently the aroma is rich with a complex flavour  there is clearly more here than just chocolate at around a for a  gram block youd hope this should be something pretty special first appearances are promisingshortly before opening the pack wed rushed off to the cherry tree in the garden and made our first ever decent harvest what better combination  chocolate and cherries picked off the tree  minutes before no that red colour is not something from the demon factory of fake food thats what they really look like but enough  taste testing timethis is a nice rich medium body chocolate not as dark as darth vader might prefer hes on the dark side  geddit but the grapes and wine add a depth and richness that makes you come back for more and more and more i dont think you can really tell that this has a pinot noir in it but it sure knocks the pants off a plain fruitandnut and it goes pretty well with a fruit salad and dollop of ice cream toonice one ashleigh and i love the photos ala delicious magazinecocoa farm actually contacted me after i did a radio segment turns out that theyre owned by a few exdirectors of a massive worlddominating chocolate company but wanted to depart and try something more natural genuine and better  stay tuned for more on this frontthank you mariangela the envy works both ways though during our winter when it is cold and rainy you in the northern hemisphere and especially in italy usually have nice weather fresh fruit good wine i could go onperhaps there is only one solution to be rich enough to live  the year in each hemisphere now i just have to figure out how to do thatyes asleigh youre right its just that i cant stand this horrible weather and i adore cherries not as much as i adore chocolate but theyre very nice tooif you figure out how to live half the year in each hemisphere please let me know hi ashleigh i live in nth qld and am a little confused about your statements regarding cocoa farm chocolate being made from australian grown cocoa this is not true  the industry here in nth queensland is in its infancy stages with no product as yet ready for sale claims such as this may contravene australian law and a lot of the growers here are quite cranky about this the rumour here is that this product is actually produced from liquid chocolate not oz origin from a very large multinational company perhaps the same one the executives originally came from tis a nice product but should be sold on its own meritswellim just relaying a combo of whats on their packet and their web siteid hope they are not telling porkieskara it sounds to me like you might have some kind of inside knowledge if thats the case i think it would be helpful if you were open about thatwe solved the problem by planting our own cocoa plantation  we have the only cocoa farm in australiaa new chocolate factory has been commissioned at our scoresby head office with manufacturing starting in december our sister company has also been working for several years to establish australias first commercial cocoa farm near mossman in far north queensland and we anticipate australias first ever commercially grown cocoa crop will be harvested in june suggests to me that they have their own farm but have been using imported beans until they are ready to to use australian ones but i could be wrongquick update weve received this response from cocoa farmwe would appreciate if your chocolate company does grow australian cocoa for its  products as weve been informed that african cocoa beans are harvested by child slave laboursounds to me like a good story there may be some child labour in some places and there may be some slave labour in some places and there may even be some child slave labour in some places but to generalise all harvest that way is a bit simplistic at best and silly at worsthi ashleigh rather than a good story its a very sad story  conservatively  of cocoa harvested in africa is produced by child slave labour  you may want to google chocolate and child slavery and youll be surprised the problem is its nearly impossible to track which cocoa has been tainted and which has not the purpose of the above post is to find ethical chocolate productsi have to say after reading the comments that the concept of australian grown harvested and produced chocolate that is slave free is an exciting and long awaited for concept  as a chocolate lover the traffiking of children and slaves has almost completely cut my chocolate consuming quite harshly but it is a sacrifice worth making and will continue to make until things change  can someone confirm  do we have australian grownharvestedproduced chocolate yetcan i make a correction to my prior comment i want to say that the traffiking of children has stopped my chocolate consumption unless it is branded fairtrade and actually enjoy it more now that i am having less of it i realise how special this treat ishi evelyn thank you for taking notice of my comment our favorite fair trade chocolate is the green  blacks organic dark chocolate with orange and delicate spices which is our favorite thanks aloti really enjoyed the bits of background information to the product that you offered in this blog and i can only dream of cocoa plantations and wineyards here in frostridden scandinavia where apples are the most exotic fruit we get now that its march  can anyone confirm whether or not cocoa farm is using australian cocoa it seems there was a small amount of deception by farm by nature in their advertising in which they implied their products were made with  australian cocoa of course the whole time their chocolate was being made with cocoa from south america and africa given the impurities especially lead that has been discovered in many chocolates im keen to buy a chocolate that is made from  australian grown cocoaperhaps its time to follow up and ask them what the current situation is
the filling however isnt quite as nice rather than tasting of real coffee it tastes more like a cheap coffee essence its by no means offensive but it is very very ordinary and after having enjoyed the caramel bar so much i was a little disappointed by thati cant complain too much though this isnt an expensive chocolate and i still found myself demolishing the whole bar without thinking about it but given the choice of this bar or its sibling id go for the caramel version every timethe name doesnt exactly roll off the tongue does it
the enclosed chocolatetasting guide recommends the stronger chocolate first so i began with the  before the  even though i normally go the opposite way both  gram packages have the same design of bold purple and gold contrasting against more rustic colors i love that effect the chocolabe bars which somehow remind me of bills of money have a reddish tint with the  being ever so slightly darkerthe  begins with a taste like spices then softens into a deep berry taste that has a very red feeling before gaining more of a chocolate taste which is accompanied by just a touch of bitter it becomes rather sweet but a natural not sugar sweetness it feels much like a fragment of silk in your mouth as it ends in a deep and soft sensation its warmth almost reminded me of hot chocolate very perfect for a cloudy dayafter having just these two pieces im very satisfied this is one of those chocolates that takes you so far you dont even feel like eating more it stays working in your mind long after it melts away not surprising when these go for  each im glad to find another bean to bar us company willing to take the time and care necessary for fine chocolatei look forward to whatever they come up with nextcomments are closed
this is one incredible bar the chocolate is distinctly five star quality and ill definitely be keen to find and try it as a plain bar when i can find it  the tiny pieces of dried raspberry are left behind to nibble on after the rich dark chocolate has dissolved and its tanginess is the perfect partner to the bittersweet kick of the   perhaps the bitter and tangy qualities mean that the end result is rich but not sickly  instead this chocolate block is dangerously moreish and i only gave love chunks and sapphire a square of it each  they were too engrossed in watching a dvd together and i shamelessly took the advantage of enjoying the remaining eight squares myselfa glance through the ingredients list reveals that the ones included in the  chocolate are as expected but the raspberry filling is like nestles club mixed berry a sobering sight for sore eyes  exactly  of the total ingredients are raspberries and further down the list is apple puree and pineapple  apple is a common filler or extender for berry flavours but pineapple is a new one to me  oh it doesnt really matter  cte dor have come up trumps and this little beauty will be a regular drop into my shopping trolleyframboise is french for raspberry so yes the same thingi do have to agree with kath though we found this and happily munched our way through a block a little while ago and it is very nice indeed terrible similarity here i tried to make sure the rest of the family couldnt find it as i stole one square at a time until it was all gone i lasted a week or twothe raspberry content might be small but this one is a winner mighty fine mighty finehmm oddly ive seen both for sale in the uk  i guess the noir framboise was an importi want itand im just about to sink my teeth into their  dark chocolate  this delicios things is not available in spainhmspain isnt doing too well chocolateywiseill have a check in my local waitrose later this week and see if they have them
i love hotel chocolat slabs not only are they delicious chunks of yumminess but you also get enough to feed a small planet for approximately five yearsluckily the mini slabs are equally delicious but much more manageable i doubt they would even feed a mediumsized city for a week thats how small they are comparatively speakingas you can see the box contains four individually wrapped slabs each with a christmassy design and different combinations of white milk and dark chocolate in no particular order we haveoverall a nice mix of christmassy themed chocs with something for everyone but for me its the cinnamon slab that stands out the quality of all the slabs is great but its nothing new id really like to see one of these peepster boxes where every slab was as interesting as the cinnamon slabyes hotel chocolat shops are dangerous placesive not had the coconut mini slab but that does sound niceokim sold  will be looking into where i can get some locallymaybe theyll release the cinnamon one as a larger single block after christmas  or how bout down here in australia dear hotelchocolat
as you can see conscious dont do fancy themed packaging or funky containers everything is hand made and hand wrapped using recycled and foodfriendly materials the important stuff is on the inside folksshort answer amazingthis is the nearest i have ever come to a proper espresso coffee in a chocolate bar all of the rich deep aromas and flavours of top quality coffee beans came rocketing out the moment the first square hit my tongue as the raw chocolate rapidly melted away my mouth was flooded with proper coffee this one had me grinning like an idiot  at last a bar that fulfilled my expectations my only regret is that it took a matter of minutes to make the rest disappeari for one will certainly be keeping an eye out for this particular bar it isnt cheap but i tell you now reader if you like coffee and chocolate you simply have to give this a go  its a stunner thank you emma youve made me very happy indeedyou lucky duck simon coffee and chocolate  if done as well as you describe  is as close to perfection as you can get
we have a bunch of stuff from hotel chocolat to review and most of it is quite simple so im going to keep this review fairly shortas you can see they look pretty much like they do on the box solid dark chocolate  stylised penguins and as youd expect they have a bit of a chilli hit to themthe chilli itself isnt that strong and the heat only really starts to appear when the chocolate has melted away so you get the full range of sensations the dark chocolate is as youd expect from hotel chocolat smooth and rich with no bitter aftertaste and the chilli is well chilli its not too potent but its enough to leave you with a warm christmassy glowyou get  penguins in a box and i guess these are the kind of chocs you could hang on your christmas tree although youd have to drill holes through then penguins eyes or share with visiting family and friends my verdict simple but effective  i suspect theyd help get any christmas party warmed upcomments are closed

theyre nice but the size of them makes it tempting to just eat all five bars like popcorn defeating the healthful purpose and i cant help but wonder if a purer rather than specifically devoped chocolate wouldnt be more salutarywas buying this at walmart and now cant find it anywhere phx azmy friend and i love cocoavia candy bars  it has been along time since we have had some  we live in the east part of the valley where is cocoavia candy bars  we have not been able to find any for some timei have tried the cocoavia bars and i must say they are just amazing they taste simply outoftheworld
one of the perks of this job is that we often get sent samples to review usually its the chocolate companies or chocolatiers that send us the chocolate occasionally a shop will send us some of the chocs they stock its quite rare that we get sent chocolate by our readers but thats exactly what malgorzata sychta didso this is the first of two reviews of bars from her native poland that she wanted us to trywell despite the somewhat distressed state the bar arrived in i really quite enjoyed iti genuinely enjoyed this bar and found myself scoffing chunk after chunk without even noticing which  given how much expensive chocolate i have in the house right now is quite a feat so if you happen to be passing your local polish shop or er poland id recommend picking up a bar and giving it a goive seen youre quite fond of polish sweets which makes me happy and strangely proud but apparently we polish people are prone to that anyways  try some other wedels products paweek trans little paul is my favorite especially the one with cream filling called mietankowy  another product i would recommend is ptasie mleczko trans birds milk  an original creation with history even longer than the famous prince polo from olza
i know i know cherry liqueur choccies are the cocoa equivalent of benny hill  very popular in the s but rarely discussed or touched since then  however i have always liked them loved them in fact but have many times been disappointed by the dodgy boxes found at the bottom of bargain bins crusted with sugar crystals and coated in the dreaded compounded chocolate  not that the words compounded or chocolate should be placed together in my opinionas tends to be the norm for cherry liqueurs they go for quantity first and quality second so the rather drab appearance wasnt out of the ordinary  i know that looks arent everything but if cherry liqueur makers modernised their presentation a bit  funkier boxes maybe or individually wrapped truffle types or got someone sexy to admit they loved them  they might enjoy a renaissance  i dont wish the same for the benny hill show repeats though  upon opening they still smelled good despite their boring presentation with a nice inviting whiff of alcohol and an even more inviting smell of dark cocoa  how did they taste  pretty bloody good actually  no actual cherry or glace version inside just a runny liqueur filling that was strong but not overpowering the chocolate at a respectable  cocoa solids was also rather nice and let the booze dominate first only to fade away and finally allow the taste of the slow melting chocolate to emerge victorious  there is real cherry brandy inside comprising seven percent of each chocolate so youd need to inhale a few before the floor came up to meet you  not bad at all  not something youd whip out to impress someone but ok as your own private weaknesscherry brandy chocolates are also one of my guilty pleasures  its so hard to find good ones  ill keep my eye out  fashionable or not these are always on my christmas list my favourites are mon cheri by ferrero but im always willing to try a new brand  apparently these are hazelnut chocolates in the us and cherry in the uk  if anyone wants to send me any take note its the cherry ones pleasethe coop were selling g of these for p in novdec fantastic bargain then they ran out and didnt restock   they are german   superb quality   too good for the coop proles obviouslyany idea where to buy especially in bulk   thanksi just spoke to walkers about these german brandy liqueur chocolates   they are only supplied to stores augustdecember under ownnames like coop tesco asda   p for  grams   absolute giveaway  and they fly off the shelves in minutes   then the supermarkets dont restock   coops in cambridge area only got one case of  boxes each last year members here please lobby supermarkets and the distributors walkers to make these a yearround item and to carry adequate stocks to meet demand   a classic case of retailers losing profits by failing to meet customer demand   thanks allhijust to say you have what looks like a good site at first glance thank you for being there and allowing meus to gather infomy weakness is for really good cherrys in brandy and extremely dark chocolate not that easy to get hold of for me as i leave at the wrong end of town and no one stocks them so i am checking supplies out onlinethe site is easy on the eye and is easy to navigate thanks for being there
at only  cocoa i thought it a little light on the important ingredients but as the proof of the pudding is in the eating i popped a square in my mouth and was immediately hit with the orange flavour its a light citrus taste which intensifies as the chocolate melts and its also the finishing flavour it did cross my mind that the reason for such a low cocoa content may well have been that the orange flavours have a tendency to dominate and consequently the manufacturers decided to save cocoahi simoni have to say the divine orange milk chocolate is my absolute favourite and i just had to stick up for it okay does not do it justice you are obviously not an orange milk chocolate fan so maybe your opinion is skewed i would recommend anyone who enjoys milk orange chocolate to give divine a go unlike others on the market its natural flavourings and fairtrade certification make it the best chocolate treat out therethanks petei have to agree divine orange milk chocolate is absolutely delicious and well worth a try i can demolish a large bar in minutes laurato pete and laura please read thishttpwwwchocablogcommiscwhywewontbereviewinganymoredivinechocolateshame on pete and laura and divine bravo to you dom and chocablog for taking a stand ill take a stand too by boycotting all divine productsdarrinits such a shame when companies do this  ive never figured it out because theyd be far better served by getting in contact with the writer and doing some kind of interview or honestly  openly posting their perspectivesimon said he wasnt a chocolateorange fan and its not like he said anything bad about the chocolate  certainly not half as bad as the publicity that will ensue good decision dom i dont like it when companies are sneakyno divine chocolate in this household  funny theyre achieving the exact opposite of what they set out to dohang on a momentthis comment may have been a post made by someone working at divine but that doesnt mean it was the idea of senior management or indeed had their approval at most well run organisations staff are given a degree of autonomy and it may be that this one dishonest incident was the work of one loyal employee thinking heshe was doing something gooda boycott of divine products will hurt the farmers they use in the poor chocolate producing companies  i respect the right of chocablog to decline to review divine products from now on but is it really necessary to boycott their products surely they are to be applauded for their efforts in fairtrade policies and for nice choc too and just need to issue an apologyfollowing this disappointing incident i was prompted to take a look around divines website and came across the companys mission statement and supporting objectives which centre around fairtrade  there are no specific stated values although both ethics and integrity are implied by their missiongiven this i would like to believe that the misguided actions of these two employees were carried out independenly and without the knowledge or sanction of divines senior management team  i believe their attempt to distort this independent review has publically damaged the companys brand image and i would be interested to hear from a senior reprepsentative what they have to say about the matteri dont know who ackers is although we obviously had similar thoughts  given the coindentally similar nature of our comments im glad dom knows me and knows ive got nothing to do with divine  ackers im certainly not calling for a boycott of anyone  just saying that we will not be reviewing their products here any more because i personally dont want to deal with them for what its worth though and im willing to be proven wrong my own research indicates that the comments were posted by management that may be one manager acting alone but its still not a very bright thing to dohi dom anna and everyone elsejust to say ive got no involvement at all with divine other than being a consumer when someone buys it for methe comments on your site were from people saying they were so shocked that they would boycott the company but having worked for years in companies with well known brands i thought id point out that it may not have been the company who posted but just one member of staffits all very interesting and hopefully an important lesson learnt by divine that honesty and integrity are important when dealing with the public and in a comptetive world it is all too easy to lose the trust of your customer base with just one smallish slipupregardless of ethics i have to say i had one of their chocolates late week and was completely unimpressed  to be honest i dont care all that much about fair trade or not although it is a great angle and i respect the idea  my wife bought it for me at an arthouse movie theater  i had a divine fruit and nut dark chocolate bar  oz  it had good chocolate flavor but it was not very sweet and very cocoa buttery  poorly balanced  hey if im gonna eat candy i want all the guilt  it was very unsatisfiying  my wife tasted it later i didnt finish it and she agreed that it was weak  wont buy again
picture a chocoholic running to a stores register already holding chocolate with a couple of other items trying not to see any more chocolate before paying and then she sees a tiny sign the ultimate dark chocolate fix back up is it a hoax is it true then i saw this tin needless to say i grabbed it and went on my way despite the four dollar price tagit seems i bought the darker of their three chocolatedipped nibs the other two are  and  instead of  and dont have espresso the chocolate is a bit sweet but with the bitter taste of the nib coming through the espresso taste comes in just before it melts leaving the slightly fruity bitter nib to chew on which by the way if you havent yet tried them cacao nibs have the most wonderful odd texture this progression of the senses is all very well but if you start chewing right away all of the flavors meld in a miraculous combination of sweet and dark that will be a bit more friendly to those with some fear of the darksweetriot ensared me starting with the tricky way this tin snuck up on me not that i mind this is a great emergency chocolate fix small enough to even fit in a pocket mostly immune to melting and filled with chocolatey goodnessalso great fun to play with make shapes with pretend theyre pearls for necklaces
and if id taken the time to read the pr material that came with the chocs i would have known that the  bezants symbolise the ransom paid by cornish people to secure the release of the duke of cornwall during the crusadesfor those that dont know the duchy originals is a company run by prince charles the current duke of cornwall on his estate  the duchy of cornwall  so it makes perfect sense to make chocolate in the shape of bezants as you can see from the photo duchy originals were kind enough to send me a box of each of the four available flavours which areorganic milk chocolate with spanish orange oilmilk chocolate and orange is such a tried and tested combination and ive had so many variations on the theme  most of which werent that great  that i was quite prepared to dislike thesein actual fact i quite enjoyed them firstly the chocolates actually look appealing theyre rounded and curvy on the front and flat on the back with a shiny finish theyre not too thick so provided you dont go stuffing  into your mouth in one go theyre not going to become sicklyorganic milk chocolate with ground arabica coffee beansbut in this case i think we have another winner theres hardly any coffee aroma but when you bite into them youre greeted with a flavour more like a rich coffee cream despite being a thin solid milk chocolate it taste like real coffeethere is a bit of graininess from the coffee beans but personally i think that adds to the effect i really enjoyed theseoragnic dark chocolate with mitcham mint oilas you can probably tell theyre going for the tried and tested flavours here coffee orange mint no fancy experimental mongoose and olive flavour from duchy originals that just wouldnt be britishthe look of the  dark chocolate here is just as nice as the milk chocolate bezants its bright and shiny and tempting looking just a darker shade and it tastes good too  not too sweet not too bitter  but the mint flavour is really quite subtle its a little too subtle for me and it felt a little like these were missing something organic white chocolate with madagascan vanilla extractvanilla and white chocolate is another tried and tested combination and again its done quite well here they are a little sweet but theres a fair amount of vanilla and creaminess in there too with the result that the overall flavour taste a little like a good quality vanilla ice creamone thing i found a little odd was that the ingredients list the madagascan vanilla extract as  approved nonorganic ingredient now obviously i have no objection to nonorganic chocolates but im not sure how the box can call these organic chocolates when one of the main ingredients isnt organic at allstill i did enjoy these theyre much sweeter than the others so i wouldnt want more than a couple in one go but they are very pleasantsumming upim really quite impressed with these clearly theyre meant for sharing and i think if youre having a christmas party then buying a box of each is the way to go that way theres some for everyoneso i dont know whether house of dorchester have turned a corner or if theyre just better at making chocolates for other people but i enjoyed all of this duchy originals range and would recommend  giving them a tryunder soil association standards in order to be organic more than  of a products ingredients must be organic in fact our chocolate bezants contain over  organic ingredients as the natural flavours we use are less than  of the total ingredients because flavour profiles vary greatly and change with the different foods that they are used with it is allowable under soil association standards to use non organic flavours the use of flavours in chocolate is particularly problematic due to its high fat content and many other organic brands also use non organic oils in their chocolatesthe natural flavour ingredients used in our chocolates are as followsive been trying to track down some of the lime thins they do around christmas time i think they can be had in selfridges and the like but ive not gotten my hands on themi wish i could buy duchy dark chocolate mint thins here in usa when living in london they were my favorite but now i miss them so much craving the mint taste they were and still my favorite
when i opened these i had some guest tasters over for afternoon tea  two of them were my parents john and pauline and their two friends over from scotland alastair and lynne  none of the bespectacled quartet are on the right side of sixty but all are dark chocolate fans and very eager to help lynn likes soft centres and pronounced the caramel chante with smooth flowing caramel a winner  alastair is a brazil nut fan and loved the ones he tried covered in old gold  he and dad also tried the hazelnut royale but both considered that the flavour was difficult to detect  mum was still chewing away on her caramel deluxe and was therefore unable to comment legibly  amongst these eager amateurs i kept on tasting  the strawberry fondant was delicious  normally i dont like strawberry fillings as they always veer towards the chemicallyenhanced overly fake flavour but this had a layer of strawberry jam on top of the fondant and was a great foil to the bittersweet dark coating  the chocolate orange truffle was also a winner  there were only two in the box and i reluctantly let someone else have the second one  caramel mousse consisted of a white marshmallow layer on the bottom topped with a thin layer of caramel  unexpected but very nice  unfortuntely the crme de menthe was green inside and rather grainy which spoiled the smooth coolness i normally expect from white mint fondant centres  others included cocoa deluxe which was just old gold chocolate in a blob and truffle delight which was just softer in the middle and the faithful old cadbury chocolate box filler viennese fudge  on the whole its a step up from their ordinary dairy milk tray selections but they could still use a few more imaginative fillings in this fancylooking selectioncomments are closed
inside we have  simple square dark chocolates packed in tightly each with a small piece of crystalised ginger on top the aroma when you first open the box is almost overwhelming if youre not big on ginger youre really not going to like theseinside each chocolate we have a soft truffley centre with small pieces of ginger strangely for something purchased from john lewis im still tempted by these so i bit into onewow these are chocolates with a punch the ginger flavour is very strong and the chilli starts to hit you just as the ginger flavour is fading theyre delicious but theyre not subtle in fact its hard to tell anything much at all about the actual chocolate as the other flavours are so strongpersonally i found the combination of ginger and chilli a little too much for my tastes so i took them around to some predominantly south american friends to get a second opinion the result was a unanimous thumbs up  everyone loved them and after  or  more i decided i quite liked them tooi think whether you like these is going to come down to whether or not youre a spicy food person once i got used to them i found them a tasty treat but i dont think i would want to eat them every day still theyre a pleasant surprise maybe i wont give up on john lewis for chocolates just yetim a real ginger fan so maybe i could take up the challenge of trying to eat them everyday 
well were only a few weeks away from christmas and of course that means seasonal chocolate products are already making their way onto the shelvesthe thing is  is this just a gimmicky christmas novelty the chocolate itself is excellent stuff dark rich soft on the palate and it manages to make itself heard above the zesty spicy christmas flavours the blend of flavours has obviously been perfected one can only imagine how many hours were spent making this happen and the whole thing hangs together very well i found mysef admiring the cocoa bean sisters for daring to attempt this and for pulling it off so well it ought to be a limited edition just because of what it is but i think it goes beyond gimmick think of it more like a christmas special  like the seasonal edition of one of your favourite tv programmes its brave slightly wacky and very tastydefinitely something special for a stocking filler or your christmas hamperwow have stumbled across this fabulous organic chocolate the guy uses essential oils in the chocolate for a different mood enhancing experience check it outwwwfeedingyourimaginationcouki gotta say simon that your experience of eating two tree inspired chocolates this year has me feeling both jealous and bemused
theyre delicious but with a certain level of success reached there are new levels of standards when these taste so nice and look presentable i find a problem the word truffles such a sacred word it is evocative of either moist smooth and rich beings like the joseph schmidt chocolates or divine and handmade rustics rolled in cocoa powderi tried these today about  minutes ago and i almost threw it up  maybe if you put them in your coffee and let them melt they may not be as bad  if you are just looking for a nice espresso dark chocolate try ghiradelli
it was nice to see that it has grown to g blocks instead of the measly g blocks i remember buying back in the s but this was the only flavour available and not my utter milka favourite the coffee milk  undressed and no longer purple the block revealed smaller chunkier squares but with the same old milka logo  i could barely control myself long enough to take this photo i know it is very sad but youve got to take your thrills where you can find themperhaps i need to buy another block i know the sacrifices i make for chocablogging accuracy and eat it alongside a cadburys plain dairy milk to fully test out my initial taste result  id also be keen to know what other chocoblog readers thinki think that the other mistake you made was buying a g bar milka needs to be eaten slowly a couple of chunks at a time  i think g is approaching sugar overdose levelsnot one of my favourites im afraid its everywhere in europe  very very common but if youd tried the coffee flavour ashleigh you might have that opinion changed drasticallythe coffee flavour was the best i was sorry to see it disappearfor me cadbury and milka is also very similar in tastelove it one of our favourites  cadbury is cardboardi dont know but i like milka far more than cadburyque ricoooi like their noisette and hazelnut i dont know about some other milka variants though because i havent tried all of them but so far i love the  mentioned variantsit is true milka alpine should be savoured slowly  my introduction to milka was via milka naps  a big box of them gifted to me  but because they were individually wrapped individual bites i learned how to make them last  there may be finer chocolates but milka delivers when you are looking for sweet creamy milk chocolate that does not leave a bitter or waxy aftertastetrai  bonne  milka  it is fantastak  
if id had more sleep the night before i would probably have taken some photos of the shop the unique and rather lovely packaging cf have won numerous packaging awards and the very helpful assistant as it was i was on limited time as my travelling companion had more interest in retrieving bags and getting to the hotel than buying top notch chocs ah wellthis was actually the last item i chose i almost overlooked it but the texture of the bar inside the sellophane wrapping intrigued me and so i asked what it was when i was told that this bar was made with sunflower seeds that was the decider into my funky cf carrier bag it wentas you can see it is indeed made up of sunflower seeds and chocolate the look of both the packaging and the contents reminded me of handmade fudge shops and village fetes the chocolate bar itself looks like something made to be sold at a school fair or national trust gift shop but the clear bag is becoming more and more popular so perhaps these venerable institutions were just ahead of their timewhen it came to tasting time this bar didnt disappoint a dark cocoa flavour to begin with and the chocolate quickly melts freeing up a host of roasted sunflower seeds and the occasional tiny salt crystal which works brilliantly as both counterpart to the chocolate and compliment to the nutty flavour of the seeds the slightly bittersweet chocolate flavours combined with the sunflower seeds are almost pralinelike giving a very satisfying finishmy only complaint has to be that it was so moreish that before i knew what had happened id demolished almost my entire slab a very well thought out combination and one which i have no hesitation in recommendingin poland there was a popular chocolate bar with sesame seeds and it was utterly delicious so i suppose the sunflower one just has to be as good i love a grainy texture once in a whilethis is really intriguing  i can see where the nut salt and sweet would complement each other nicely where in the us would i be able to get this
now i find myself wondering how many more theo products i can find whatever the flavor i think theyll pull anything off so whatever you come across get it its sure to be greatthe theo coconut curry bar is also incredibly lovelywith a decent bit of heat and the companys ethics are wonderful as well
this is another block brought back from europe by the adventurous ashleigh and marvellous marie for us to sample together  they have a relative living in germany who said it was a very popular flavour available there and both ashleigh and marie said that they saw lindt available even at vending machines in railway stations  now that is commuter travel done rightas with a toddlers nappy during a long haul flight there was a bit of leakage  marie was concerned but i assured her that meltings sugary whiteness or leakage was never going to deter a chocablogger with the whiff of lindt already assailing her nostrilsthe outside was of course lindts classic milk chocolate which is always creamy and a treat all on its own  however this aint no sedate and safe milky treat for the kiddies or nannas wanting to leave their dentures out and have something pleasant to gum on no way  it may start off innocently enough with the superb milk chocolate which normally doesnt cover anything too demanding in the taste sensation department  not so in this case  after the chocolate had melted enough for the filling to emerge my tongue and taste buds were treated to pear pieces lurking in a syrupy liqueur that had quite a kick to itmost liqueur chocolates ive tried are coated in dark chocolate so this is something different and it works  the pairing of creamy and sedate with strong and aromatic produces a surprise in each mouthful  lindt havent put a foot wrong yet except that its not available in australiai know that a three day old yoghurt has more culture than most aussies but i reckon we could handle some of this fancy schmancy magermilchpulver williamschristbirnen stuff  we did invent the disposable wine bladder bag after allmate did you have to bring toddler nappy leakage into itsorry annabelle but you know us aussies  less culture than a three day old yoghurt  dom sweetieloviesweetie  its called artistic licence i have had poire william it is wonderful to have it in chocolate would be divine poire william is made by growing a pear into the glass bottle then pear liqueur is added to the bottle very expensive very tasty almost like ice wine
the chocolates themselves come in a plastic tray presumably to protect them in transit because  joy of joys  these alcoholic little treats have no crunchy sugar interior to keep the booze away from the chocolate hoorayso what do they taste like definitely alcoholic for one thing the fig vodka wastes no time in warming up your tongue but its not harsh in any way of course i do not possess a sensitive womans tongue and the chocolate is very soft on the palate at  cocoa theres enough dark bittersweet flavour to blend well with the initial hit of alcohol and the finish is a pleasing combination of the two tastes of course the subtleties of the cocoa flavours do tend to get lost in the alcohol but i was very happy to be eating a liqueur chocolate which didnt contain  sugar by weight these were certainly unlike anything ive come across before and i was glad i picked these upthese sound so good i will definitely keep an eye out for these at some specialty storesinteresting ive lived in hungary for over  years but never seen them do you remember where you got them from
on our recent trip to europe oh how i like the sound of that as if we do this sort of thing every few months darlinks rather than every  years we scoured the supermarket shelves looking for a wee spot of chocky a bit out of the ordinaryeurope varies widely  the big global brands might be omnipresent but what they offer varies from one country to another this and translating back to english only makes the hunt more excitingin berlin we found lindt edelbitter mousse fig  caramel according to my sister who lives there the various lindt fruity things are seasonal  depending on the availability of the fruit that goes into them naturally we had to purchase a suitably impressive pile to bring home and bring them home we did surviving trains plains taxi rides and australian customsso it was with great anticipation that today on the oldest sons th birthday we had a gathering of the clan and with much ceremony opened the one of the spoils of travel  in this case the aforementioned lindt on first impressions this is a nice dark  chocolate  well suited to a warm afternoon with a gathering of family the dark chocolate is fine slightly sweet slightly bitter and gradually deliciously melts inside this is the mousse and fig  caramel the consensus from the gathered family was varied  yes its definitely figgy but there was something missingwhilst it has a presence of fig the flavour is small and overwhelmed by the chocolate and the caramel not sure where that ended up i have a theory  anything apart from a plain chocolate needs to be consumed in one of two ways  either crunch it up fast to gather all the flavours together or let it melt slowwwwwwly so the flavours emerge gradually one after anotherso perhaps this is a crunching chocolate rather than a slowmeltingandsucking chocolate but no the manner of the eating didnt really make a huge differenceif you ever walk near a fig tree during summer you get a blast of figgy smell  something in the leaves long before the fruit becomes even remotely ready something that says hey watch and wait great things are going to be happening here soon and when you have fresh figs they have a flavour beyond comparei had hoped this chocolate would capture some of the smell and some of the feeling of figs and summer we cant blame temperature it was a lovely day and the bar had been out in it all afternoon all in all the reality did not quite match the anticipation we know lindt can do wonderful things with chocolate in this case it needs something to give it a bit of an oomph a liftblame it on the figs perhapswell done ashleigh  youve done us aussie reviewers proud and i particularly like the block nestled between two bottles and then opened and adorned with blueberriesid still like to find it here in australia and try it for myself thoughwhat is the difference between this bar and the creation  fig  caramel  this sounds so niceand im not really a fan of dark chocolate
sometimes it isnt that easy being an international chocablogger take for instance my recent visit to kiev as is the case with so many european countries there are kiosks on the streets which sell cigarettes sweets alcohol and foodstuffs the difference here was that they were sealed and attended by nonenglish speakers having no command whatsoever of ukranian i was reduced to trying to point at various products in an attempt to purchase a small selection of what was availablethis box of twelve espresso flavoured tablets are manufactured by kraftjacobs and im afraid that beyond the fact that they contain  coffee i can only guess at the cocoa content there is a  somewhere in the ingredients list but the three languages it was printed in were all cyrillic and so im at a bit of a loss to translateanyway as soon as i opened the box slid out the gold foil wrapped tray and tore it open i was immediately informed that these were indeed coffee chocolates the rich dark aromas of coffee and chocolate were only to eager to introduce themselveswhen it came to tasting these little oblongs i was impressed with the first taste a good strong chocolate taste backed up with a rich deep coffee flavour the centre of each chocolate was made up of a soft paste which wasnt very sweet at all and delivered a healthy belt of coffeehow unfortunate then that my taste experience should end with what can only be described as instant coffee granules loose in my mouth yes as the filling melted away i found that i was left with a multitude of small grains of coffee flavoured something and instant coffee granules is about the best way of describing them as someone who hasnt partaken of a cup of instant for a good few years i found myself wondering why on earth anyone would want to incorporate pretend coffee into what would appear to be a premium product then i remembered who had made it kraft probably have silos full of instant coffee and they probably just came up with a new way of shifting some of ita very promising start with an ultimately disappointing finish shamewe bought some in italy and found them absolutely gorgeous unfortunately i havent found them in any irish shops  yet another excuse for another trip to italywas gonna say sth and stello above beat me to it pocket coffee heavenly yumyumi was born and raised in ukraine till i was  and korona was and still remains the premium chocolate brand there i bring it back to ca every time i visit my family i trul believe there is nothing like it here in the states i am probably bias i have never seen or tasted the coffee tablets korona its unfortunate that instant coffee is still holding a strong position in the ukrainina market not a lot of ukrainians buy and brew real beans hence i assume is the instant coffee granules used in the chocolate i dont know if the product would take off in that market where the natural coffee taste is still sort of new and unusual but i may be wrong maybe it was just cheaper to produceim a peace corps volunteer in moldova the tiny country right next to the ukraine and we eat tons of korona chocolate here its not great quality of course because nothing that people can afford to buy in such a lousy economy as exists here is but its usually pretty tasty ive had these espresso chocolates myself and truth be told ive become so used to the jacobs instant coffee here its almost impossible to find real brewed coffee that i hardly minded the granules leftover im realizing as i type this just how sad that is but the truth is that i cant imagine anyone here or in any other part of eastern europe where the products sold is the least bit bothered by the remnants of what they assuredly all know not as cheap instant coffee but coffee on that note i recommend trying some less exotic variant of korona some time its not the greatest thing ive ever tasted but its one of the greatest things ive ever purchased so cheap and i figure that means theyre doing a fine job with whatever resources they put into the stuff
to tell you the truth im still not sure on that one the chocolate is a more minor taste so its hard to isolate it the hazelnut pieces take the show with chocolate and salt and sugar working behind the scenes i started to observe how the crunch reminded me of toffee when i spotted a honeycolored crystal so thats what i was chewing you know the largersized crystals they usually sell cane sugar as judging from the little spots of salt that jump up on your tastebuds every so often i wouldnt doubt that there are salt crystals in here also is that supposed to be a good thing probably not but it just makes this bar all the more funfun is amazing when it collides with fine but thats what this range seems to do i wish more places carried them its one of those great for any occasion chocolates except this time thats the truth not propagandacomments are closed
my friend ashleigh and his lovely wife marie have recently returned from taking their two sons on a four week european holiday  now to you us uk and european readers bear in mind that such a trip from australia is a huge undertaking think  for the flights alone a  hour journey home with your knees up under your chin and a mere kg weight allowance for each traveller  therefore it was a real feat for them to bring over two kilograms of chocolate theyd gathered from switzerland germany france and england all the way back to south australia  ashleighs eyes gleamed with pride at his selection and marie said go on pick some and try them out  she didnt need to ask twicecote dor is a french brand and the degustation sesame noir  was chosen because it seemed so unusual  sesame often ends up in a paste or crammed into a health bar and this was neither of those two unappetising options  besides isnt degustation normally associated with picking the right wine to go with the right mealback to the  dark with sesame  as you can see for several thousand kilometres of travel secreted in suitcases the elephants have withstood the rigours pretty well and still have their trunks upthere was a lovely cocoa whiff as the foil was ripped away which always bodes well for the eager chocolate reviewer  the sesame seeds are liberally sprinkled throughout the chocolate and are very lightly coated in fine toffee which not only adds a sugary kick in contrast to the bittersweet chocolate but also an extra crunch to enhance the burnt toastiness yes my wine tasting superlatives need an overhaul of the seeds  we all loved this one even my karate buddies naomi and sarah who arrived part way through the sampling  its great to see chocolatiers using not only the best quality dark chocolate but also combining it with creative flavour combinations this is really sensational stuff and goes down extremely well with freshly ground and brewed coffee or tea according to marie  cote dor have released their dark  and dark with raspberries here but not this particular block  hopefully theyll rectify the situation very soon  if youre lucky enough to have it in your neck of the woods buy itit most certainly is  i just wish it would find its way onto the shelves here in australia so it can be a regular treat rather than a whenever i know someone heading off to europe rarityi was stunned at how delicious it wasthe local supermarket in paris must have been running a promotion they had the stuff piled up a couple of metres high in a huge display weird thing was i seem to be the only one mad foreigner paying any attention to itwe also have some of the cote dor dark  raspberries i think we bought this during the travels but shudder cant remember for sure even though it might come from the kraft megacorp it is very nice indeed little bits of crunchy raspberry something all through mmmm reason for hedging a bit about the big companies  i know full well what happens when the quarterly earnings dont meet expectations something gets cut one hopes it is not the product qualityyour right kath im going to make that happen becouse kraft owns cote dor im ganna send them a email i cant wait tell they bring them to melbournechocolate and sesame  who would have thought that would make a good combination  does anyone know of any other brands that combine these ingredients  would love to taste itpam  keep reading chocablog kath and i seem to find similar products with spooky regularitythe norwegian brand freia also do a fantastic dark chocolate with roasted sesame seeds its also half the price of the other flavours for some strange reason we love itzayna i wish you the very best of luck  use any of your means methods and wiles possible to bring this block to australiasimon  were kind of spooky chocotwins methinksashleigh  you too are on the same wavelength because the cote dor raspberry has also been eaten enjoyed and will soon depending on uncle dom of course appear on chocablogpam  find or make a friend going to europe and beg them to bring you back someunless youre already from theremarie  thanks mate and right back atchameli  are you from norway or  do you know where freia is available outside of norway because it sounds rather intriguingjust for you to now this chocolate cote dor is very common in europe you can find it in every supermarket at least in france belgium etcmeli the freia premium dark series is only a rebranding of the classic cote dor bars freia only started selling them a few years after beeing taken over by kraft foods which incidentally also owns cote dorkath a slight error in your post the cote dor brand originated in belgium not in france founded on cocoa beans from the african cote dor by charles neuhaus hence the elephant logoalso they have recently released to limited edition spcialits bars in norway at least both are filled bars one with lemoncrystals and a hint of ginger and the other with ground almonds and figs very interesting chocolatesis there anyone who knows a website you can purchase freia lemon ginger premium chocolate bars  i have searched and have come up with nothing  this is one of the most amazing chocolates i have tasted and cant believe i cant get it in the states  helpin spain i find cote dor specialities orangepistache and raspberrybut not sesame i found it in south france why do they not distribute all the specialities may i buy them online thanks in advancewow i would love to try this has it come out in australia yeti just recently got back from a trip to france and this chocolate bar is amazing  literally my french friends and i ate it every day for a snack or dessert  try it paired with fresh strawberries and a rose wine from provence  a very tasty combinationanyone know where you can purchase this in the usoh my goodness i went to france last fall and bought three bars of it now i only have one bar left i love the sophistocated flavor that the sesame adds to the chocolate i really want to find a place to buy something similar in america if you are in europe and see this in the store try it
the mulu range consists of three different bars silk dark and dark with raw cocoa nibs of which i am very fond all of which are made with ecuadorean cacao this particular cacao is known for its subtle light flvours and heavy bold body the flavours tend to be very light floral notes which can exhibit traces of coffee vanilla and spice with virtually no bitternessas the company are still awaiting their packaging i was sent one boxed bar and a couple of sample cubes of the other two typesi decided to go for the silk chocolate first as it suggested a light soft chocolate the cubes were quite large so i began by biting one in half i was quite surprised at how sweet the chocolate was  not sugary sweet but a very light almost floral sweetness the chocolate flavours were also very subtle and it melted away with amazing lightness and delicacy i found myself quickly reaching for the second square just so i could continue making notes on the flavours which certainly lived up to the promise that ecuadorean cacao offered silk indeedpalate refreshed i ripped open the second sellophane bag and extracted a square of dark again the softness slightly less sweetness and a little more dark cacao flavour the mouthfeel was extremely delicate and soft and the chocolate melted away leaving my mouth feeling fresh no sign of overly powerful flavours or cloying textures here and none of the grainy feel ihad experienced with other raw chocolatei was immediately impressed by how well behaved the cacao nibs were  they had been corralled onto the top of each piece of chocolate in a terribly well organised fashion and showed no sign of wanting to break free once again the chocolate melted away very quickly leaving a custer of cacao nibs for me to slowly chew my way through the nibs provided more complex flavours  notes of citrus vanilla and nuts to follow on from the much lighter flavours of the raw chocolatesounds heavenly thanks for the review i hadnt heard of this kind of chocolate yet
in case you cant work out what they all are from topleft going clockwise we have a gorgeous ghost scrummy skull bewitching bat fiendish finger creamy cat  and tasty tombstonei have to say the thought of eating a creamy cat concerns me slightly but given that im also eating a bat a skull a finger and a gravestone i guess that says more about me than the chocolatesthere are a total of  chocolates in this g box each sits in a little plastic tray and is wrapped in clear plastic these are clearly designed to be shared out and i wouldnt feel nearly as bad giving these away as i would the mini slabsthe chocolate itself is excellent as youd expect its a sweet and creamy  milk chocolate and you can actually taste the cocoa flavours coming through and when chocolate tastes this good i can quickly forget that im eating a representation of someones cat these look greatnice review too  i laughed
i found these a few weeks ago and they appealed because they looked well cuteunpeeled they dont look as attractive  sturdy bullets instead of funky cups but i was more concerned with what was inside the shell i started with the mildest  vanilla frappe and was pleasantly surprised at the noticeable vanilla crme flavour inside the runny dark filling  toffee macchiato also had a lovely burnt sugar flavour that emerged through the rich coffee overtonescapppuccino was also very nice but id be struggling to differentiate between it and the vanilla frappe if blindfolded but thats not really a complaint  the espresso was my favourite  strong syrupy coffee that burst out of the good quality  dark chocolate  it was comforting to read that ground coffee beans vanilla and coffee concentrate were among the usual list of ingredientsthese would make nice gift to give a coffeeandchocolate lover or to serve with your own brew to your guests after dinner or as i did on my lonesome with a glass of cold milk or iced coffee  i had these little beauties at pm and was grateful that they didnt keep me awake for too long afterwardsthey look really messy to eat but at the same time really deliciousyoure correct on both counts cocoazilla  like your sign on name by the way
it is an ingredient in the liquor absinthe and also used for flavouring in some other spirits and wines including bitters vermouth and pelinkovac it is also used medically as a tonic stomachic antiseptic antispasmodic carminative cholagogue febrifuge and anthelmintic in the middle ages it was used to spice meadbut when i looked up shiba i was informed thatshiba or absinthe is illegal in some countries because of its stimulative drug properties however in morocco it is a popular repacement for mint in tea during the winter when mint is out of seasoni really like this bar it has none of the taste connotations of some other unusual bars it doesnt come across as a wacky idea put out for sale as a novelty item and it doesnt taste like anything ive had before this is to date the bar that makes me wish there was a stainer franchise in the uk so i could buy it for my friends and fellow chocolate loversif you see this one grab it i know ill be buying more if i ever see it againwormwood eh  in my meditation class last year our teacher brought some in from his property for us to look at and sniff in a meditative way of course  naturally id much prefer to have it in some chocolate
to me nothing says expensive gimmick quite like chocolate bought from john lewis the brent cross store where i purchased this has a small but constantly changing chocolate gift section thats crammed with shiny packages containing overpriced confections of questionable qualitythis little plastic box for instance contains g of chocolate and set me back a whopping but of course youre not meant to buy these for yourself theyre meant to be a gift hence the label that looks vaguely like a prescription and the large cross embossed onto the chocolate itselfso definitely a gimmick  and a horribly overpriced one too if youre looking to buy a chocolate gift do yourself a favour and go for a simple quality bar of chocolate insteadcomments are closed
this is part of the  phinney the companys address fantasy flavor flight range all of which display the artwork of kittenchops of course despite the silly look theo chocolate is very conscious proudly displaying organic fair trade and fiftypercent recycled signs in fact they claim to be the only organic fairtrade beantobar chocolate factory in the united statesseeing the little crunchy bits yes french bread is an ingredient i wondered if it might be like some sort of good quality crunch bar sitting a piece in my mouth i found some nice red flavors in the chocolate along with something sweeter when i came to the bread pieces honey maybe i thought but i wasnt really getting itso i decided to chew on a piece instead oh my what an experience now i know how chocolate can be nostalgic even if it isnt something you ate during childhood and i didnt eat bread and chocolate either unsure how to describe the taste i turned to the ingedients list butter made with sweet cream sea salt that explains it thenthis bar is the perfect example of melding flavors together deep chocolate crunchy bread sweet butter and tart salt you can taste them all and they all work so beautifully together i cant wait to try the other two theo bars i bought so thank you so much theo chocolate for an amazing new idea based off the everday bread and butter
halloween is nearly here and while im not a major fan of it myself any excuse for more chocolate cant be all bad so here we have a seasonal addition to hotel chocolats minislabs rangethe slabs come in four ghoulish designs and feature a combination of milk white and caramel chocolate and as youd expect theyre all devilishly divinemy only real concern is that these are way too nice to give to any kids that may come trick or treating on october st and theyre also too big  i mean what would the parents say if you accidentally induced a diabetic coma in their beloved offspringbut i do have a simple solution to that  close all the curtains switch off the lights and pretend to be out while you scoff them all yourself trick the kids and treat yourselfi like the idea of just closing the curtains and scarfing these all to myself it might be worth having to clean up all the tricks the treaters will leavepolgive those away over my dead body i fell in love with the caramel chocolate from the moment i felt it melting on my tongue and no amount of trickandtreating could make me give it up sorry kids youll just have to make do with something elsemexican chocolate tastse like sex and cigerettes

not only was i struck by the wonderfully inventive selection on offer  try amaretto truffle balsamic vinegar and honey chilli ganache ginger caramel and maple cream to name a few  but also by their huge lifesized chocolate molds of cocoa pods and teddy bears in dark chocolate wearing milk chocolate overallsand thank goodness she stuck it out with him  my selection of chocolates were carefully carried through customs and sampled at home with my friend  and guest taster  jillfirstly the dark chocolate with the white w on it  a deliciously dark coating that instantly melted to release a cool and creamy filling with the barest hint of wasabi  unusual but not overpowering and rather refreshingthe only white of the bunch gave another indication of the high quality chocolate used and housed a lemon and thyme cream filling  jill liked this even though shes not a white chocolate fan and before tasting said but these flavours should be on roast lamb not chocolate  she changed her mind immediately afterwardspistacchio and marzipan  i adore marzipan and jill has the same love for pistacchios  her view was to leave the pistacchio be mean old marzipan but i loved this as a neat little move away from the usual almond concoction  both of us agreed that the dark chocolate accompanied it beautifullythe pineapple was a surprise  despite its rather kitsch seventies shape it delivered a powerful hit of pineapple followed up by a cheeky dash of black pepper  more importantly this combination works  brilliantlythe small praline cream held its own amongst the more creative flavours by relying on the dark chocolate to work its magic and melt away to reveal the softly creamy hazelnut so light i wondered if it had been whipped with egg white  simply the best praline ive ever tastedthe final morsel was the love heart which was another revelation of top notch dark chocolate melting to reveal a tart passionfruit cream that held its own against the cocoa notes  thats absolutelyl beautiful jill said this shows off the quality chocolate and ingredients couldnt have said it better myselfso if youre ever in wellington its the next best thing to discovering that lord of the rings director peter jackson calls it his creative home  these chocolates are as welloooohhhh those look wonderful my mouth was watering through the entire read and those pics didnt help p  i have no chocolate in the house right now and am craving lolwellington now im homesick  have to add melting perfection to the must do list next time i make it backyou must anabels plus the staff in the shop are really friendly enthusiastic about their products and willing to chat and sharewow youre getting closer to home with every post any chance you made it down to christchurch and unearthed any chocolatey secrets were hiding generally i think the stuff made elsewhere beats most of our locallymade chocs  love to be proven wrong though youre right i live just down the road from melting perfection and their chocolates are delicious
i was quite surprised when i cut the bar in half rather than the gooey white filling i was expecting was a smooth milk chocolate truffle with lots of small minty crystalsthe truffle is soft and smooth with a satisfying crunch from the crystals but the overwhelming flavour is mint lots of mint theres a little bit of cream in there but not much chocolate flavourthats all fine if you like mint and youre in a minty mood on a particularly minty day but i wasnt feeling overly minty when i sat down to review this and consequently found it a little too muchive had one of these recently i mustve been feeling very minty that day as i loved it i also had a mint aero recently too for the first time in years and it was horrible  my initial impression was that underneath the mint it tasted of slightly warm justabouttoturn milkmmmm i love the thorntons mint bar its yummytry out my chocolate lovers  listhttpchocolateheavenonlinecomthechocolateloverslisti had this flavour and i agree that its too minty maybe they should use less peppermint oil as you can hardly taste the chocolateyou sat down to review a mint chocolate bar and you werent feeling minty
theres barely any chocolate taste hiding in there though but thats okay since twix doesnt claim chocolate extremes its only the addictive flavors and textures that carry this one throughannabelle  this ones from the us although you might be able to buy some online through amazon the link above or other online sweet shops  just check to see if they deliver to the ukoh i wonder if i can find it in canada it really seems yummy i just love peanut butter mmmthey are fabulous  much more satisfying than a simple candy barwhats odd is that peanut butter twix were around years ago  i used to get them out of the vending machine in college  but then they disappeared  only to reappear in the last couple years as a new twix bar  now wikipedia says that they may be discontinuing them again  so get them while you can of course not all wikipedia info can be trusted sohttpenwikipediaorgwikitwixhere i am  years later myself getting them out of the vending machine at my college as long as youre not eating them three years out of date lolnice  drools
if you have a coop near you its well worth checking out primarily because its rather tasty but also because when you buy this you know your money is going to the people who grew the beans not to some huge multinational  and that can never be a bad thing can ityou should try the  cocoa bar we havesounds good how is it priced compared to gbs is it available internationallyit is  for both g barsits not available internationallyive been eating and baking my way through coops fairtrade chocolate selection and im a fan of iti am very pleased that there is ongoing development of and interest in fairtrade chocolate here in australia we are starting to see more of it stocked on supermarket shelves which is great i really like the cocolo brand  it is a premium swiss fairtrade chocolate and is certified by the leading organic certifier in switzerland as well as being gmo freeso this would be a good one to chop up and stir into the christmas cake mixturehave not tried it but am sure it would be delicioussounds good im a huge fan of gbs maya gold so i guess this one would be my kinda thing will try as soon as i get the chance
once again it looks just like a big bar of solid dairy milk from the outside not much to report here unfortunately there doesnt seem to be any real fruity aroma eitherinside the chinks of fruit are a little more noticeable than in the apricot bar but i think thats just down to the vivid red colourim not usually the kind of person who studies the ingredients list on chocolate indepth but i wanted to know exactly how much cranberry there was here the wrapper states it has sweetened dried cranberries  which seems good but then it lists the ingredients of the cranberries themselves sugar cranberries rice flour sunflower oili know cranberries require a bit of sweetening up but according to that sugar is the primary ingredient in these particular cranberries hmmmall in all i did prefer this to the apricot bar and actually quite enjoyed it but if im buying a fruity bar of chocolate id like to be able to taste some fruit in it  im hoping cadbury will come out with a new improved version of this at some point because i like the idea  but the execution leaves something to be desiredthe best way to get a fruity bar of chocolate would be to buy the fruit mix it in a bowl with melted chocolate then pour it into a chocolate mold to reset see no added sugar and lots more fruit flavour yes i have done this once with chopped dried apricots and chopped macadamiasnow theres an idea might have to try thatim not a huge fan of cadburys chocolate its a bit too sweet not exactly meltinthemouth and kind of flat compared to some other brands i was hoping the cranberries will make this one stand out but was disappointed havent tried the apricot one but i think ill pass  if its even worse than the cranberry variety id rather tuck into thorntonsit is better den all chocolates i only prifer dis becoz i love  itekdam sahi hai bhsdsiduits very deliciousits just amazingi just love the taste of it hmmmmmmmmmmmi love the taste like silkhmmmmmm yamuywooooooooooooooooooow  best taste
another in stainers spicy collection this one is a  cocoa bar which has been blended with african herbs  in this case cola cinnamon tonka bean and vanilla  its the first of a handful of  bars in my possession and i was rather looking forward to trying these as the milk bar had been a little disappointingthe chocolate itself was surprisingly sweeter than expected but with good bittersweet leathery woody notes and a very tart finish the herbs and spices never took over from the cocoa flavours but there were definite cinammon and vanilla tastes there and a hint of nutty earthiness which i can only surmise came from the tonka beans a second piece revealed more of the complex flavours in the chocolate with the cola nut flavour revealing itself yes it does taste vaguely like cocacola apparently cola contains theobromine a stimulant which is also found in chocolate who knewoverall i found this to be a very interesting bar to taste the flavours of the chocolate really didnt get going until the second or third piece by which time i was nodding my head enthusiastically whilst trying to come up with ways of describing them its a very good blend of some interestingly complex flavours and im now really looking forward to trying the rest of the setone thing i will say  its a shame stainers dont have uk distribution perhaps someone can step up and take care of that
to be brutally honest the packaging didnt look too promising instead reminding me of those dodgy easternbloc cherry liquers that try to look sophisticated but mostly end up in crazy discount shops  and for a reason  another black mark against this block was that it was on sale and clearly marked as such yet the dozen or so local kiwis in the aisle with me seemed to be actively reaching around it for the whittakers and cadburys instead  whythat important question still hasnt an obvious answer because this unassuming block is really quite good  damn good in fact  the rich dark coffeelike aroma of the chocolate was obvious the second i ripped open the wrapper along with a gentler sweeter smell of berries  the taste played out along the same lines  top notch chocolate fully deserving of belonging to the dark side devotee hall of fame which gradually melted away to enjoyably chewy dried blueberries that added a fruity finish to the experience  love chunks found it rather moreish for a chocolate on the darker and richer siderichfields chocolate are owned by the new zealand food group limited  which perhaps doesnt sound as luxurious but they proudly proclaim that all of their ingredients are not genetically modified and that the art of dark is out passion  let it become yours  i would most definitely like to  if i can find some more whilst im still in new zealand and will hope that they ship it to australia like their label says they do to singaporecomments are closed
this is one of two newish fruity and crunchy bars in the dairy milk range the other being a cranberry and granola bar which ill be reviewing later this weeki dont tend to keep up with everything that goes on in the world of dairy milk so i hadnt heard anything about these bars when i saw them on the shelf but it has to be said that i noticed them straight away thanks to their rather funky and colourful wrappersas you can see the picture on the wrapper is a fairly accurate representation of what you get here a standard block of dairy milk with chunks of apricot and crumble thrown in very simple but quite effective but for me the apricots and crumble pieces were a little bit of a disappointment they both had a nice texture with just the right amount of chewyness and crunchiness but there just wasnt enough flavour here admittedly apricots dont have the strongest flavour in the world but even when you let the chocolate melt away in your mouth and youre left with a mouthful of chewy and crunchy pieces there isnt much flavour going onthat said its still an interesting  and welcome  addition to the range hardcore dairy milk addicts are there such things will almost certainly appreciate it but personally im hoping the cranberry  granola bar will have a bit more bite to itif the apricot flavour was a let down for you then the cranberry one is going to be a real disappointmenti hope adding fruit to the bar isnt part of a wider drive to make chocolate healthy i also hope it they dont add the one of your  a day sign to the packaging  like heinz did to its all day breakfast in a tinim afraid the cranberry one is a let down toohmm i prefered the cranberry one over the apricot im interested to hear what you think in the hopes opf appeasing the great god of dollars whose name is profit cadbury has probably used the cheaper tasteless turkish apricots i wont be trying this onelooking forward for more information about this thanks for sharing eugenei loved both the apricot crumble crunch and the cranberry and granola bars can you let me know why they are impossible to get at the moment in shops in dublin hoping they are here to stay as they are really yummyclaire  ive not seen them for a while in the uk so i can only presume theyve stopped making them theyre certainly not promoting them any more
sometimes you can find good things at costco but accompanying the low prices the quality is often comparable so when i saw this bag of over a pound for seven dollars i knew it could go either way but i was in a hurry so i grabbed the bag just in case it turned out to be a winnerit bothers me that the bag says belgian quality all over but it is a belgian company with belfine being a chocdecor brand which explains all the flowers and bugs on tops there are sixtysix moussefilled chocolates but a very uneven dividing up amongst the kinds fortyeight blue fifteen yellow and an amazing three green i wish they would actually count them to make this at least a little more evenfrankly though i think these chocolates are cute the size and shape of their wrappers made me think of party favorsthe yellow is milk chocolate with chocolate mousse filling and a white chocolate flower which has a dark chocolate center as i tasted it and began to analyze it all those ideas fell away the only word i wanted to use was delicious the chocolate has a unique slightly nutty flavor often a milk and white combo can go ill but it works here its very creamy but not sickly at allthe green is essentially the same thing with a chocolate mousse inside as well it seemed like it might be a slightly darker milk chocolate but theyre probably the samethe blue is dark chocolate with vanilla mousse and a white chocolate butterfly with a milk body im really not too fond of the dark chocolate used its a bit of the dark and heavy kind but with all of the flavors combined im reminded of a fudge i make with chocolate chips and condensed milk the vanilla taste leads closely followed by the dark with the white coming in nextmy biggest complaint take some of those fortyeight blues and exchange them for yellows i prefered them because they were less average this isnt a big winner but its definately worth trying if you see it especially in such a big bag thats enough to get any chocoholic excitedcomments are closed
rather than attempt to create an actual orange shape hotel chocolat have gone for a much more elegant box with  generously sized circular chocolates each made to look like a slice of orange rather than an individual segmentthe chocolate here is  cocoa solids and has a smooth texture and rich taste the orange flavour comes from valencia orange oil and is very nice but its also very subtle so subtle in fact that if you eat one quickly its hard to detect at all at times the dark chocolate flavours seem to overwhelm it completelythis is clearly another product made for sharing but for my tastes theres just not enough orangeyness or sweetness hotel chocolat do also do a milk chocolate version of this which i think id prefer but what id really like to see is just like a little more of that valencia orange oil in this dark chocolate version to give a bit more zingthere aint nothing naff about a chocolate orange dom  wash your mouth outoops sorry andrea ive had the hotel chocolat flavoured with their valencia orange from a box of chocs and youre right about the subtle taste  if you eat them too quickly but hotel chocolat are to be savoured and droooled over my partner goes mad with me sometimes when i want to read the menu card and drool over them for ages
i purchased this in spain but the wrapper is printed in german and ive yet to see this albino twix in the uk perhaps its going to be a snow twix xmas gimmick oh and if it wasnt before but it is now please pay me for the ideaas you can see its a twix but covered in white chocolate i havent had a twix in a good while and id forgotten just how sweet they are i certainly couldnt manage the second barsugary biscuit base topped with overly sweet caramel and now available with an even sweeter white chocolate coatingits a nice twist on an old favourite or another way to keep selling product without having to invent something new probably a good stocking filler or a neat way to put a roof on your manger cake not for me thoughyou can get these in the uk i bought  for a  from poundland last week very sweet but very nicethanks for that helpful comment i wasnt sure if they were here in the uk or noti would really like to try this one so shall be keeping my eyes peeled when i go shoppingim a twix addict but can almost taste the overlysweet white stuff just by looking at the picture  im sure its worthy of a taste test thoughi find regular twix a bit too sweet so ill be staying away from this onea tad too sweet for me i love caramel but i prefer it combined with some fine dark chocolate as white choc bars go the white kinder bueno is much more deliciousthis was a imited edition about  years ago in ireland  they are sweet and they were to die for  i havent seen them since and will be looking in poundland for them nowi shipped  boxes from dublin at the time  i love twix and loe white chocolate  peanut butter twix is also very good tooomg   i have never seen this  please distribute to us  this looks delicious i love white chocolate and twixthat combo makes my mouth watermmmmmmi live in the netherlands en they even sell them here ooohhh i lve these candybarsjust have a full spoon of sugarsame sensationive never seen these i think id like the white chocolate ones better as im not keen on the milk chocolate on the original ones the milk chocolate is too sweet or tastes like its gone off these ones may help the flavours blend a bit better
whittakers have used their bittersweet dark chocolate  at a nottooshabby  cocoa content  as the serious outer coating for their frivolously flowing caramel filling  i was so excited i rushed back to the hotel room flung it on the bed and took a photo of it  no other niceties were observed as this chocablogger was even more eager to strip it of its inviting gold wrapperthe chocolate is almost black in colour and my first square which admittedly was munched eagerly and not slowly savoured failed to provide anything but the barest hint of caramel right at the very end of swallowinglearning from this i took my time eating the second third tenth and twentieth square letting the dark gritty chocolate establish itself amongst my receptive bitter and sweet taste buds was the first step to heaven the second was the release of the sweet honeyish caramel after the chocolate surrounding it had warmed and dissolved  a blissful double bonus bittersweet chocolate coupled with a sicklysweet inside is as nice as id always dreamed it would beperhaps ill ponder it in more detail after i finish the entire blockwhittaker are proud chocolate confectioners that has continuously claimed proudly their products are  cocoa which means they dont use palm oil in their products such as their rivals cadburyjo is spot on whittakers would never use palm oil cadburys use it so they can reduce the amount of cocoa to save on costs make no mistake whittakers is a high quality chocolate at all timesi have just bought whittakers dark caramel and i have to be honest the caramel is insipid when put with the amount and taste of the dark chocolate surrounding the caramelso i have just dismantled each square taking a little chocolate and all the caramel suggestion make the caramel more like caramello and put less sugar and less chocolate around the caramel there you go
i love world market lately theyve been adding their own products to those that they sell ive yet to try their chocolate bars but their hazelnut cocoa spread has been a friend of mine for a while now but when i went to buy a new jar i found this one in its place at the time they didnt have a new spread that wasnt crunchy but they now do would it be as good i worriedit is although the design is different the ingredients are much the same except that this one has real vanilla instead of artifical the old spread was just like a hazlenut truffle filling but this is less thick and more butterlike it loses a little richness yet that makes it more suitable for everyday i wasnt too excited about the pieces of hazelnut but theyre a nice addition again they turn it into a spread that wont lose its charm after the initial excitementwhether on toast bagels crepes or chips both potato and tortilla  i was in a creative mood this spread passed the test maybe its because of belief that hazelnut and chocolate were born for each other still i think many people will be glad to have a chance to have chocolate for breakfastim in heaven just looking at this stuff  where do you find itannabelle you can find it at any world market cost plus here in the usi purchased this yesterday from world market as soon as i got home i tried it yummy it tastes like the filling of the ferro roche candieslooks delicious does it taste better than nutellai am from singapore interest in distributing in singaporeat the world market in arlington tx they have discontinued this producti loved it  know where i can find the same thing
at this point though i do have to make a complaint galaxy why do you have the nutritional information for a g bar on the wrapper when its actually a g bar not only is it the height of laziness its also highly misleading  you cant even really claim g is a portion size because theres no earthly way you can divide the bar into g portions without weighing scales a lot of patience and a bit left over sort itunwrapping reveals a slab of dark chocolate in a five by five grid of little wavy squares i think remember i ate half of it before it occurred to me to do a review im extrapolating from the bits left they look as though they wouldnt snap cleanly but actually mostly they do it looks fairly unassuming its the taste where this bar really comes into its ownnow im not normally a fan of dark chocolate there is no way i would have actively chosen to buy this bar however its actually really nice its not overly sweet like the milk version of galaxy chocolate but theres no bitter aftertaste either it has a rich and smooth texture and is actually very pleasant id buy it againfor hardcore dark chocolate fans this is probably going to be too mild for you but if you like nonsweet chocolate without the bitterness hangover galaxys new offering might be just the jobi nodded heartily to the bit about nutritional info  unless they write the grams on the pieces i dont see how anyone could ascertain how many gram sections they had eateni agree with annabelleregardless of that i was still drooling while reading the articlethis chocolate sounds like something id like to taste test myself  can it be easily found for purchaseteresa  its available in my local sainsburys uk and its not a huge branch so i assume its fairly easily foundi just bought this and was highly disappointed i noticed from the very first bite that it was absolutely brimming with sugar eurgh dark chocolate implies bitter and strong yet this bar was smooth silky sweet personally i could never recommend this to fellow dark chocolate loversstephen  i saw it in my local waitrose yesterday so its still aroundyakk the chocolate is very bittergalaxy dark chocolate makes the best chocolate mousse of any and i mean any brand of dark chocolate which makes it very sad that i havent been able to find any for months and months please dont say that it isnt made any morethank you hilary i have finally found another person that is questioning what on earth happened to the galaxy smooth dark bar i too have been searching for it for months and months from tesco and sainsburys to convenience stores all across london i cant stand the craving any more somebody find me oneim actually eating galaxy smooth dark chocolate right now yeah i have to agree with others its good but not great enough for hardcore dark chocolate fans like me lolplease tell us where you bought it i never never see it on sale  
this particular bar is made in italy and is a brand owned by the sugar company as you can se the metallic box with its somewhat abstract artwork and textured finish puts it firmly into the posh chocs departmentthis particular bar has  cocoa chocolate with  dried kiwi fruit pieces my only previous experience of kiwi fruit and chocolate is anton bergs kiwi discs so i was quite intrigued to find out what a bar with a relatively high proportion of fruit would taste likethe chocolate is of course a good dark colour with lots of fruity citrussy aromas some of which were definitely cocoa based on the tongue the initial taste is very dark burnt sugar and rich deep cocoa notes immediately softened as the kiwi pieces are releasedtheres tons of lovely dark cocoa tastes to tantalise the palate enough to make me wish id bought one of their plain chocolate bars as welldark chocolate with kiwi fruit pieces mmm cant wait to try thatis it possible to know the stockistslooking at the sugarcompanynet web site it seems that they do usually sell this online but their online shop appears to be offline until october hmm the whittakers kiwi pieces were rather easy to chewdissolve probably because they also had apple puree in themsounds lovely will definitely give it a go
whittakers chocolate has been proudly new zealandowned and made since  and has just started to make an impact in australia in the last couple of years however even keen chocabloggers such as myself need a holiday occasionally and this year i decided to eschew the usual sun sand and sea of tropical north queensland for new zealand staring forty in the face meant that it was getting embarrassing and shameful that id never set foot on the soil of my closest neighbour land of the long white cloud the mighty all blacks rugby team and whoever is left of the kiwi folk not already living in australia and londondespite popular belief the kiwi fruit is not merely the bird new zealands faunal emblem with its beak removed but a bona fide fruit altogether  it is very tangy and considered by most people as best suited to sitting on top of fruit salads and pavlovas so this block was bought out of touristy exuberance and a surfeit of wine rather than any real optimism  as you can see it looks neither different nor especially promisinghowever its such a thrill to start off a holiday with a pleasant surprise because this tastes especially delicious  the chocolate isnt particularly dark at  cocoa solids and  milk powder  but very flavoursome  and combines with the chewy kiwi fruit pieces extremely well  the actual fruit pieces are a fair bit more honest than the berry pieces i once reviewed in the nestle fruits of the forest dark chocolate block consisting of more kiwi puree than apple paste and having a very noticeable and real flavour  the chocolate is made from ghanaian cocoa beans as is most of whittakers range but it is the added ingredients below lose listed for chocolate that aroused my curiosity  humectant glycerol wheat fibre why acidity regulators malic acid and tripotassium citrate which i can only assume are to do with keeping the kiwi fruit flavour well preserved and appetising  if its for any other reason i dont think i want to know any morewhatever the ingredient list its delicious and my husband and daughter agree too  there may be a case of when in rome or why ouzo sipped in greece by the sea tastes a thousand percent better than when taken home and sampled in a freezing bedsit but it is mostly because it is well made milk chocolate with a unique and perfectly matched fruit flavour  well done whittakersyou wait ages for one kiwi chocolate review and then two come along at once   really whats the other onekath youll have to wait until tomorrow oh  and i think the tripotassium is just there to make the feathers less chewymy father purchased some of this choc in the illawongsydney area not sure exactly what store    but its here in australiai just had this today i thought it would taste funny but it didnt it was waaaay way better than i thought it would be its my first take on whittakers toothis is the best chocolate ever made the little piece is jam packed with flavorl brought a block when we were on holidays in queensland it was really nicel did not think a chocolate would taste that nice my drama is now that since being home in south australia l can not seem to find it any where a lot of stores have the other whitakers  flavours but not the kiwi fruit chocolate which to me is the best l will keep looking
such a long name for such a simple and diminutive g bar of chocolatethe rainforest alliance works with local producers to conserve the forest promote sustainable business practices and improve the lives of cocoa growers so that little frog on the wrapper means youre doing some good while youre treating yourselfof course this is all well and good but it means nothing if the product isnt up to scratch and luckily this bar is particularly goodi found the plastic packaging mildly annoying it would look much better wrapped in foil and paper but the chocolate itself is top notch serious dark chocolate aficionados will love it i did  and im neither serious or darki must say the wrapper leaves this bar of chocolate down very badly  i like the frog logo but the wrapper cheapens the product  this dark sultry chocolate block needs a beautiful foil wrap and red ribbon would love to taste this block of luxury a must for any chocolate indulgerthats cleared my thoughts thanks for coiubnrtting
the chocolate is nice and thick and standard thorntons fare but its the turkish filling thats the most interesting part here  its one of those things you either love or hate and also something chocolate makers seem to have difficulty getting rightim pleased to say thorntons have done quite well with this particular take on the turkish delight bar the consistency is firm and chewy but melts away nicely in the mouth i particularly like the way the flavour builds as it melts away  first you get that familiar turkish delight rose flavour then you get lemons then the rose flavour comes back againwhen i reviewed the frys td a few weeks ago i thought it was a really good bar  since you say this is better im gonna have to give this one a whirl now thanks for the review great pics btwjimthanks jim if you want a real chocolate mission how about tracking down a frys bar cadburys bar one of these and some real turkish delight and doing a side by side comparisoni really like these treat bars from thorntons the turkish delight flavour is nd only to the continental viennese truffle for me personally  delicious yum i really love turkish delight and still dream of seeing it coated in dark chocolatedom  that sounds an awesome idea i need to find some high end td to compare them all to though i dont suppose anyone knows the best turkish delight around do theyyup there is a ms version of this bar but it comes in two pieces per pack not one whole bar like this one turkish delight is a bit like marmite you either love it or hate it i cant stand it not even smothered in lovely smooth thorntons chocolate
the chocolate is dark shiny and bitter the mousse filling light yet still somewhat bittersweet and the fig and caramel filling gives it a fruity dark undertone of sweetness that is quite sublimeseek this one out folks its a corkermatt thomas if youre reading this  get this flavour down under now pleasegive me lindt in any variety at any time of day or night and i guarantee you itll be gone in seconds i particularly love the dark chocolate with coffee and the red lindor chocs but this one looks and sounds seriously delicious too is it available in any british department storethis is a brilliant bar indeed how sad that it is very difficult to find lindt creation or petits desserts range in my city perm it is russian federation tried some of this in switzerland it was delicious with coffee  have not been able to locate any since  does anyone know where i can get it in the uk estce normal que dans la denomination de votre chocolat fig  caramel le mot fig soit ecrit ainsi au lieu de figue  merci de votre reponsewhy oh why oh why can i not get this fig and caramel lindt chocolate anywhere other than in germany it is driving me insane  i can buy all sorts of flavours in australia but alas no fig and caramel  can anyone please relieve my aching palate and tell me why they wont export it to the wider world  it is nothing short of torture that i might only ever have this chocolate within my palm when i go to europe which is not too often im clearly broken heartedi found this lindt fig and caramel in spain in  i was very eager to get back home to melbourne and buy it by the truck load only to find that its not available in aus im still searching
each truffle is wrapped in a copperorange with a light pattern inside youre greeted by a strong chai smell sweetened a little by the chocolate amazingly it looks just like the picture on the package its not all the time that that happensthe outside milk chocolate is very tender and though fairly thick it gives way to white filling where the chai is contained quickly the two accent each other very nicely the strong next to the sweet this time i agree that milk is better with its creaminess suiting perfectly an intense dark chocolate added to the chai would be too muchso if youre partial to chai youll love these if you dont like chai dont even consider them the taste is strong but its another good showing from starbucks sure not the most spectacular but still goodmaybe i should give these a second chancewhen i had them they tasted like rotten milkwell i gave them a chance  the taste of the tea was not bad  actually it was interesting and somewhat pleasing  but the chocolate left a lot to be desired  it was very waxy tasting  not creamy at all  i even got a crunch out of one  but they still had a paraffin taste and texture to them  if you are used to this type of chocolate then it may be an experience for you  if not go with the chocolates you knowoh i havent met anyone who doesnt love these im absolutely addicted to them and have been since the first time i tried them  and i normally hate chaii did not care for these at all  chocolate and chai tea just do not go together from my point of viewnobody tasted the cardamon inside that is even more pronounced than the chai tea they are too sweet for me but the cardamon makes an interesting blend with the subdued chai tea
the rather unfortunately named dick smith is a living aussie icon which is rare because we tend to celebrate hanged bushrangers dead horses and failed explorers well known for making his millions from cheap electronics before selling off his business and venturing into launching the australian geographic magazine and store franchise and doing his best to get aussies to buy food made and owned by other aussiesas such hes tried to emulate any typically australian product thats since been bought by evil multinationals  some of his versions are just as good and some arewell lets just say wellintentionedas you can see from the photo the temptins were slightly melted by the time i got them home but thats never stopped me before i remember being airmailed a packet of tim tams when i was living in london and they had literally melted and reset into a large brick comb by the time the packaging was torn off  sadly it was obvious from the first mouthful that temptins just aint tim tams  not in the same ballpark let alone neighbourhood or sports division  the coating is stingy overly oily and the ingredients at the back mention the words no decent chocablogger ever wants to read  compounded chocolate  no wonder they melted the chocolate layer is far too thin and greasy to want to stay on the  quite frankly  substandard biscuit  the creamy milk filling so beloved of tim tams is also replicated here but had a texture akin to library paste and is about as appetising  overall there was a slightly chemical taste in my mouth after finishing which didnt exact tempt me to reach for another temptin  oh and dick  please do us a favour and add a g to temptin or youll anger the exenglish teacher in me and many other pedants for goodso sorry dick  i like the reason behind your actions but maybe youd be better off using your millions buying the tim tam factory and brand from arnotts instead of trying to recreate your own weaker versionthey are now known as dick tams over here
two layers of canaps that are clearly designed to look like something that would have been served at a slightlytoopretentious dinner party circa  in place of smoked salmon we have a florentine square of caramelised nuts and a caramel buttonthere was only one way to find out so i took them to a party to see what other people thoughtsomewhat surprisingly my partygoing friends were not as baffled by these as i was it wasnt that they understood the thinking behind them  it was more that they simply didnt care they were more interested in how the canaps tasted and thankfully they taste pretty good the florentine is a little too sweet for my liking but it does add a nutty crispiness to the overall effect and its quite clear theyve been made with the usual high quality hotel chocolat ingredientsso they went down well with my friends but for me the usual hotel chocolat wow factor is more of a wtf factor herewe served these at our afternoon wedding reception in november  and they went down a treat two boxes were scoffed by  guests in about  minutes
unlike fruit  nut the cashews and raisins were in tiny fragments so there was to be no hamsterlike hoarding of almonds in one cheek and raisins in the other and you thought it was just you that did that didnt you so there was a constant fruitnut taste being brought into play while the chocolate melted but it was the taste of the chocolate that was so different rich and deep with creamy vanilla and caramel tastes it was really rather good according to the wrapper the raw sugar cocoa butter and cocoa mass came from costa rica bolivia and ghana the complex flavours of the chocolate certainly suggest ghanaian beans perhaps the sweetness of the raisins made a difference but i didnt taste too much sugar in this bar and the last few pieces of nut and raisin provided an excellent citrussy finisha very tasty bar and  with  of ingredients traded fairly one you eat knowing youre giving other people a decent living wageincidentally does anyone else remember the tartanwrapped totally chocolate border creme eggoh yes i loved these i wish cadbury would bring them back
even though it was a cool and rainy day the chocolate was still exceedingly melty making it nigh impossible to break off a piece instead of breaking i had to tear along the marks as if peeling off a sticker it also vanished instantly in my mouth allowing little time to taste its caramel flavor despite being melty it has a rather rough mouthfeel and leaves grease in your throat which i absolutely abhorso i think you guys already know this but hersheys is a candy bar not a chocolate bar its blasphemy to call it such it barely even tastes like chocolate at all which is why you eat it when you want a sweet not a chocolatei know its cool to hate on hersheys like everyone else but its really not that badare you aware of the great history and the one of a kind chocolate formula that the great late milton s hershey created your not just enjoying an american original or a piece of american history your enjoying with every savory taste a one of a kind piece of chocolate you can go and taste very similar chocolates all around the world and yet there are none that have that one of a kind great smooth taste like a beautiful hershey baron my first jaunt overseas many years ago i excitedly bought a bar of the famous hersheys but have to say i was bitterly disappointed it tasted to my palet like chocolate does when it has been left out in the air for sometime a strange unpleasant taste  lacking in sweetness this wasnt a one off chance unlucky bar either as having spent vast amounts of time stateside ive have the opportunity to sample hershey products  numerous times be they bars or kisses or whatever  each time i have been disappointed at the taste or lack of everyones palet is different so what is not to my personal liking will clearly be acceptable or delicious  to others  doesnt mean someone does not have an appreciation or understanding simply because they personally dislike a particular manufacturers productlike i said we are all different  have different palets so no one is more  right or wrong than an other in their views or opinionscocoa id just like to point out a couple things ive never reviewed yetany nonhersheys bar that was simply wrapped in plastic so how can you say that ive never mentioned that wrapping on other bars and i am very aware that the hersheys bar has a unique flavor however how can it be the taste of simply chocolate when no other chocolate has that taste you say that i can only handle normal chocolate but i believe normal means regular or common hersheys is definately more normal than the pralus bars i adoredjust know that im not trying to truly bash on the hersheys bar i respect others who love it and yes it is an american classicim not usually snobbish with chocolate give me a dairy milk any day but when i went to new york i had a bar and ive never had a chocolate that tasted so much like vomit cocoahahahahaha that is alli agree with cocoa if your a true chocolate lover and maybe cocoa does that for a living we dont know this is a free worldmost of itwhy cant someone say what they want to plus if your really going to attack what is known as the great american chocolate bar you better dam well be ready to be questioned i dont think what cocoa said was anything badi think she is a true chocolate lover  with i am guessing a very good palatethe way it reads i really think she does that for a living i agree with you cocoa and dont see who could not like a hershey bar if they are really into all things chocolatewhat is great about the world of chocolate is that there are many tastes and many products i know outside of america many love what is called the normal chocolate being creamier and smoother then say that of the unique hershey bar what i think cocoa was trying to say is that milton hershey fell in love with chocolate making what he learned from people outside of america he set out to make a very different and unique milk chocolate for years when it first came out and maybe even to this day by what some of you think as told in the emperors of chocolate european chocolatiers would call it the ugly chocolate they could not understand how it sold or why people would want it but then as they studied it they found out it was chocolate but unlike any chocolate they have ever had the more they tried it the more they understood it yet no other chocolate maker can make hersheys chocolate one of a kind in the chocolate worldi love hershey but i love all sorts of chocolate from around the world my first chocolate love will always be that of the very first chocolate i remember the hershey bar the great american chocolate bar what is wrong with arguing and being passionate about something you love nothing if you love something with great passion it is always wonderful to hear how that person brings there passion out with words and movementsthanks for the blog hope you will give hershey another try sometime in the future god bless milton s hersheyi agree the hersheys bar is one of a kind only because no other company would stoop so low to create such a foul cheap bar with some of the worst ingredients ever no one outside of america likes it because we all know it tastes like vomit youre eating vomit be proud of your barwow such a heated discussioni would like to point out that all reviews are subjective personal opinions and as such people will often have a completely different opinion  and thats one of the things i love about doing thiswe try not to be snobby about chocolate but we have to say what we think in a review or there wouldnt be any point in doing it so do feel free to say what you think in the comments but keep it civiloooh a chocolatebased controversy maybe my aussie tastebuds have been overly influenced by cadbury but my hershey tastings have been less than positive  my first hersheys was a cookies and cream which tasted  weird  then one christmas my mum was given a bunch of miniature hersheys pieces yes well travelled pieces stored in the fridge but still which i wasnt impressed with but ate anyway there was no other chocolate in the house and i was craving something sweet meh whaddaya gonna do i respect the preferences of others but given the option hersheys is not my first choicethat being said points to doms post cmon this is a reviewing thing everyones different lets just be nice about it okthe problem is your trying to say cadbury products are to be like hershey products or the other way around what you need to do is never compare cadbury or the like to hershey the point about hershey is it is unlike any chocolate in the world you can go ahead and say thats because it your missing it hershey is made out of very good ingredients and is very different from what your normal taste buds seem to be able to handle cadbury is very good creamy silky and tastes great hershey is smooth softharmonious and tastes great unlike terry i am not an alcoholic so i dont know what vomit tastes like but if it tastes like a hershey then sign me up terry or maybe terry you just dont have a clue about tasting chocolates as you seem rather biased for one brand by your reviewsyou should get out more in the chocolate world i dont know about you but hershey sure sells a lot of chocolate so many people must not think like you terry thank god as we dont need any more alcoholicsi tried hersheys several years ago found that it was very sweet but didnt have much actual chocolate flavour i abandoned it in favour of other varietiesimim an alcoholic my god i had no ideasomeone hold meha this is hilarious there is a whole world of strife out there you are talking about chocolate chocolate be nicei have to say i agree with some on here and really with cocoa who i can tell has a passion for chocolate it blows my mind that a person who says they have a passion for enjoying chocolate to where they join a team to write about chocolate has no clue what they are doing how can you write a blog about hersheys chocolate that does not take into account that unlike any other chocolate you have tasted hershey stands alonenot for some vomit childish remark either not because of its history but because of how it is made and how it came to be milton could have made what the industry calls the stable standard milk chocolate he wanted something different set out and following his own ideas and then the standards set back then broke new grounds and transformed the industry there is nothing wrong with the stable standard mind you omg cadbury or uk chocolates belgiumswiss or sweden and the list can go on forever there some of the greatest chocolates around one of my favorites is de brand in the heartland of the usa in the east gertrude hawk michel moots and lin libby to name a few on my list is the great american chocolate barthe taste is unlike any of the aboveit stands alone and it doesnt surprise me that most of your palates are not trained and you just go with what is normal to yourselfyour not a true chocolate lover if you cant find the good in a hershey bar and have to lower yourself with a biased mind that sets out to destroy and mock those that do have a passion for all things chocolate look around this blog and you will see more cadbury the stable standard then any other reviewsopen your mind to the entire world of chocolate and discover what the world has not only in taste but its vast history and slight changes from each brand know what to ask like cocoa said how was it stored how long did it sit there look was it at a counter where the sun hits it at part of the day then when you buy it how will you store it is that the only mass brand that is packaged in those crappy wrappers or is that the industry you have to go in with questions and an open mind you must go in with a passion for what you are going to be talking about if your going to blog and rip down an icon that was built on american know how that changed the face of chocolateyou might want to have a clue on what you are doing and what you are saying your lack of taste shows you should stay with brands you knowyou can not allow your mind to be open and your biased showed you are just a chocolate fool not a chocolate lover with passion once you figure that out you will be able to share your true love for the greatest thing on this planet the wonderful world of the delectable cocoa bean and all the vast wonders that this treat has to offer all of useveryone needs to untwist their knickers this is so bizarre why just because you dont like a certain brand of chocolate you cannot call yourself a chocolate lover how pompous i actually like hersheys cookies n chocolatethere i said it we are all being silly geesebless you vic someone gets it for the love of pete listen to vic i dont care if you think im mean or hate what i had to say you said  ive never reviewed yetany nonhersheys bar that was simply wrapped in plastic well you really havent had many then have you i have had your beloved cadbury and it was wrapped in what you call plasticit in fact is cellophane and did you know that whitmans candy company initiated use of cellophane for candy wrapping in the united states in  upon visiting a chocolate operation in the uk that was using it already funny as since hershey is born here in the usa did you know that most use cellophane type packaging did you know when i was in devon in the uk i bought a delightful cadbury and it was wrapped in cellophanesame as the one i bought right down the road the other daystrange you never reviewed what seems to be all around this industry maybe you should start looking at what your reviewing dear did you really say how can it be the taste of simply chocolate when no other chocolate has that taste did you really not understand what were talking about and this gives you the right to trash the great american chocolate bara country where you came from by your bio do you not understand what is meant by hershey being different from other chocolate it is still chocolate dear just unlike any other chocolate is that too hard for your mind to grasp do you think all chocolate therefore should all taste the same be made the same and be packaged the same does your mind not understand the suddle nuance of chocolate making  you then said   you say that i can only handle normal chocolate but i believe normal means regular or common hersheys is definitely more normal than the pralus bars i adored are you kidding me your going to compare a pralus bar which has a common thread tying there bars together thus is a dark tone and to some extent woody notes especially cedar how on earth do you compare this to milk chocolate first of all second how do you compare this to a milk chocolate that is made for the masses and is sold in just about every store in the usa  i could have understood you trying to say that the dairy milk or a cadbury with milk nestle milk were more delightful to your palate then the milk chocolate of a hersheys your saying an apple is better then an orange when were talking orange dear in the dark chocolate world pralus is rather normal even though they are very delightful with many notes to them but then the dark chocolate world has those notes more so then milk and of course way more then a massed produced milk barwhy do you believe that regular is normal or common  i think with thinking like that you close your mind off to something that is similar but yet not the so called normal hershey is a normal massed produced chocolate bar like cadbury nestle and so on but yet in the normalcy hershey stands alone for making something different within that world of milk chocolate just because your palate cant handle the unique milky smooth taste of a hersheys bar there is no reason to lay into it since you cant understand what chocolate truly has to offer its not pompous its passion for art and skill into this wonderful world of chocolate no one is saying if you dont like one brand your not a chocolate lover i know there are some i favor more then others but what i am saying is if your goiing to write about something you better dam well do your homework if you dont people like me will call you out on it for the so called chocolate lover you claim to be you can not just attack a chocolate icon that changed the face of chocolate with a biased mindbefore you say pompous think passion before you get your knickers in a bunchcomparing a pralus bar to a hershey bar thats rich thanks for the laughcocoa if youll notice im still new to this website so the reviews i have here are not all that i have tasted and reviewed personally and being american cadbury isnt mine so you have no need to bring it into the conversationwhen you say that i trashed the great american chocolate bar just remember that i stayed brief in my review i didnt use quite so many words as you use in abusing me i dont mean to compare pralus and hersheys i was merely illustrating a point by mentioning both of themand thank you for the wonderful laugh in some of your misspellings but ill admit it can be hard to type correctly when you are too passionate and excited about something one must then take ample time to calmly write things out
most showbags are for children but there are a couple that dont necessarily contain chemicallycoloured sherbet sticks warheads and gummi bears  my favourite is that done by swiss glory local chocolatiers that are owned and made by swiss emigrantsfor twenty bucks whats that in english money  nine quid you get thisyes theres a gingerbread man or person lurking in there but they gave me a free sample of this bread coated in dark chocolate so he felt like a teasingly nude version of what they also offerthe bag of four milk chocolate coated macadamia nuts were a genuine surprise  the nuts were crunchy as well as buttery  often macas can get stodgy and greasy if theyre too old with a tiny layer of toffee to add to the crispness  i wish i had  instead of just four  the milk chocolates  truffles filled with coffee and a honey mixture and a wedge of their classic milk with layers of slivered almonds and a hazelnut praline stick  were all superbthe two florentine biscuits were coated on their backs with milk chocolate which just blended so well with the honey almonds peel and cherries of the biscuit  they are small but very sweet and more than two would be too much  the milk chocolate teddy bear disappeared in a joyous instantthe dark chocolate truffles were divine  one with an even darker yet softer and creamier centre that literally exploded in my mouth and slapped awake any taste bud not yet paying attention but in a good way and the other with a rumfilled centre  oh to be able to dive face first into their dark truffle melting potif i get nothing else from the show apart from a stomach ache sore feet and an empty wallet i get this showbag because everything in it is absolutely top quality every timewhat a magnificent goody bag  gives me ideas for the coming holidays  thanks for the great post  i especially love the chocolate covered gingerbreadman
i have to say that i am a little disappointed in my venchi experiences to date both bars have failed to live up to my expectations there is a third and again very different bar awaiting my attention i hope it goes some way toward redeeming venchi in my eyescomments are closed
luckily half the pieces in this box are covered in belgian dark chocolate  so i purchased them safe in the knowledge that these are work calories chocablog is work no really rather than some frivolous indulgenceas you can see the nougat is packed with fruit and nuts or cranberries melon pistachios and hazelnuts if you want to be precise i think only covering half the pieces in chocolate is a stroke of genius as its the pictures of the naked nougat on the box that really sells them well thats what sold it to me at leastbut what of the chocolate covered pieces well its actually pretty good although there isnt that much of it the back of the box describes it as  plain chocolate a term which i personally hate but the covering is so thin that the sweetness and fruitiness of the nougat underneath comes through almost immediately both the flavour and the amount of chocolate complement the nougat perfectly and sweeter and the whole thing would be too sweet any thicker and it would just be too heavyand the nougat itself is excellent its soft chewy fruity and totally delicous its much more moist and infinitely less polystyrenelike than the thorntons nougat in fact it was so good that i demolished the entire box as soon as i opened it and im having to write this entire review from memoryif you love nougat youll almost certainly love these if you dont love nougat well i suggest you go out and buy a box anyway and send it to me thankso my god i need to know where i can buy these i really wanna try em they make me so exited for some reasonwe make pistachio cranberry nougats as well but without the chocolate coveringhttpwwwetsycomviewlistingphplistingid
i couldnt handle it my mouth and nose scrunched up after two pieces i just had to find something else to put in my mouth to take out that sting so what can i say i know that some people adore this bar but i who loved another  so my problem isnt there dont it may be the origin of the cacao beans i cant find the origin for these but pralus used the lessbitter crillo beans for whatever reason ive now truly learned how different chocolate can be pralus at least succeeded in a bar that more people will enjoy only consider bonnats if you have a taste for bitter im not sure i can apply the word to anything else right nowmaybe i have a taste for bitter  i didnt find the bonnat  bitter at all just very dry in fact i found the first moments in the mouth almost sweet however i wouldnt dream of eating more than one or perhaps two pieces im not surprised you couldnt continue now lindt   that i thought really was bitterunlike your hersheys review and your unwanted attack on my spelling and the unwanted attack on the great american chocolate bar i would like to say good job on this review this is how you should write i knew what you were saying and what you meantit should be the origin of the cacao beans and the way they are processing there product is what i have found in the industry kudos for a very good insightful review if only you would have done the same to the hershey barunlike you who started out with the pralus  i was a bit unlucky making a random choice and going with the domori puro  for my first pure cacao bar for me as a first timer it was literally uneatable despite being used to other bitter chocolates trying other domori bars later i found that this very powerful taste is actually the domori trademark and the same notes were instantly recognizable in  bars as well hopefully the pralus  i have in waiting is more palatable to me id prolly wanna try that for some hot cocoa
the rosemary bar was up first and the label kindly informed me that rosemary has a stimulative effect on the circulation and central nervous system and can help with depression apparently it can also help people that frequently feel dizzy very interestingim pleased to report that i wasnt disappointed either once on the tongue the rosemary flavour began to slowly build as the chocolate melted i found that the balance of flavours was just right  any more rosemary and id have lost the bittersweet elements of the  cocoa dark chocolate any less and it would have been too bland i now find myself torn between conservation and gluttony do i preserve it until i find more rosemary chocolate or just pig outwhen it came to the crunch or should that be the snap im afraid i did something that i have never done in however many reviews  i spat out a piece of chocolateyes the clove flavour is really that strong overpowering any cocoa flavours for this palate at least the  medicinal sharpness of the cloves killed off my taste buds in seconds leaving me reaching for a couple of glasses of water and cancelling any further reviewing for that evening too much for me but maybe not for someone who loves cloves in the way i love rosemarycomments are closed
i hope you appreciate the lengths i go to seriouslyas you can see this bar features the same distinctive pattern as the toffee bar too the blurb tells me this bar is made from ecuadorian cocoa beans  florida orange oil and finely ground cardamom like the toffee bar this one also has a pleasantly tempting aroma when you rip open the nonrecyclable packaging oranges lots of orangesi did however find it quite difficult to detect any trace of cardamom until after the chocolate had completely gone a very subtle peppery aftertaste slowly built in my mouth which to be frank i found a little annoying it simply wasnt connected with the other flavours at all im all for adding a bit of spice to chocolate but im not sure it adds anything to this particular bar i wouldnt be surprised if the main reason its here is simply because cardamom looks good written on the boxall in all not a bad little bar if youre into orangey chocolate personally i prefer the toffee variety but i still have more of these to review so ill withhold final judgment for nowim disappointed that the cardamom flavors dont show up i tried the dolfin bar as well and didnt get much cardamom there im wondering if anyone makes a cardamom bar with a good pop of the pod flavorto be honest im not exactly a cardamom aficionado but i dont think i would have noticed this was anything other than chocolate and orange had it not said so on the boxi came i tried i conquered  but it wasnt exactly as good as i thought it would be the chocolate felt if anything a bit on the hard side the orangey taste was quite subtle though
to ease my eyes from the box and cure my grumpiness i had to buy two classic cherry ripes to compare with  yes not one but two  of the newer richer thicker better cherry ripesnaturally as is their standard modus operandi cadbury have reduced the weight of the new bar by g  the classic is g and the double dipped is g and only my taste buds would be able to tell if such a sneaky act could be forgivenit was looking good so far  much thicker and darker covering on the double dipped  i reminded myself of just how good the classic cherry ripe tastes just so i could have a balanced viewpoint dear reader before trying the new onenot so in this case  the chocolate layer is noticeably thicker than the original cherry ripe which gives the inhaler moi a longer moment to enjoy the slow decadent dissolving of cadburys beautifully rich old gold  cocoa chocolate  then the coconut and cherry filing  which looks tastes and feels noticeably moister and softer than the original  emerges through the bliss of the chocolate revealing the sweetness of the glace cherry and the lingering chewiness of the coconut  cadbury should be beating their chests loudly and with pride at this achievement instead of merely hiding it away next to the crunchies on the supermarket shelves  this will most definitely become a favourite of mine  in fact it already isi havent been able to find a cherry ripe in ages i think theyve stopped making them in nz  is the new version dairy free still sounds good enough to be worht the risk perhaps a trip across the ditch is in orderhi annabelsthey have never made cherry ripe in nz as far as i know when it has been available here it has been imported from australiai am an australian living in nz and i have been waiting patiently for  long years for it to be available here and lo and behold weeks ago to my delight i discovered them in kmart bars and snack size bags i am reluctant to share this information for fear that my supply will come to an end spoke to cadbury who said that they were only going to be here in stores till christmassadlyenjoythe new cherry ripe would have to be one of my favourite chocolate bars ever the  cocoa might be strong at first but the cherries and coconut filling even that out however once you have had one of these you cant go back to the original cherry ripeive heard all sorts of terrible stories you do not want to know what goes into a cherry ripe that sort of thingi dont care they have always been and will always be pretty damn good now i gotta go get me some of these double dipped thingies and try emsounds lovely wonder how to get them to the statesi actually saw them on sale the day before yesterday and splashed out and bought  of them by far the best chocolate bar ever createdphil you are a man after my own heart  i saw them on special too but only bought two
when i saw this bar it struck me as a pretty thing but with some obvious seriousness the chocolate doesnt really carry on the pretty look thoughthe first thing that came to my mind from its boxiness was a tonka truck its also divided into some of the smaller pieces ive seen though not the smallest it has a feel like wax in your hands and smells deep bitter and sweet all at the same timeso despite my comments about the tonka truck this is a nice bar too bitter to eat much of but maybe that works out to be a good thing when it was  for  gramscomments are closed
this is one of a range of simple square bars of chocolate that thorntons are doing at the moment im not entirely sure what makes it special but it does seem a bit of an odd way to describe toffee i found myself wondering if it was part of the ok once you get to know it range made with not too bad really cocoa beans but that probably has more to do with the strange ways my mind works than thorntons product naming policiesfirst impressions are everything so i was a little disappointed when i opened the well designed cardboard box to find the chocolate wrapped in plastic it may have unwrap me  eat me  love me stamped all over it but its still plastic its ugly difficult to recycle and theres really no need for itthe ridiculousness of this situation is only emphasised by the wording on the back of the boxi mean come on wed love you to recycle this but you cant why even botherbut my mood was lifted somewhat when i opened the plastic and was greeted by a wonderful toffee aromadespite not being a fan of the packaging i really enjoyed this bar i even had to put it back in the box and hide it from myself so i wouldnt eat it in one gounfortunately precisely  minutes later i found where id hidden it and demolished the rest of the bar oh well back to thorntons i guessive heard from a little birdy here in australia that thorntons might make its way down here judging from this bar i should be excited and perhaps hopeful that theyll sort out some decent  recyclable packaging by that time
the design is certainly less sophisticated than chocolade but maybe theyre right in marketing it more towards kids the aroma i found nice and familiar what was it oh thats right artifical chocolate taste not surprising considering theres no mention of chocolate in the ingredients only natural and artifical flavor ah but i truly liked the concept because its carbonated the chocolate flavor comes more as an aftertaste but you get both at almost the same time anyway it also has a pretty chocolately color however since there isnt any coloring in it i think we have the cane sugar used to thank instead of any chocolateim not sure how chocolade was made but my only problem with coco fizz is that its a fake chocolate taste with more quality ingredients id be all for it even as it is i say rather nicewhat this drink tastes terrible the aftertaste is like throwing up a tootsie roll i will never drink another coco fizz
as you can see it looks very similar to the ms bar but there are a couple of differences the thorntons offering is decorated with milk chocolate rather than dark and the pattern on the top is differentthe filling is the same sweet tangy and lemony mousse that the ms bar had but this time i think it goes a little better with the white chocolate the contrast between the citrussy filling and creamy coating isnt quite as jarring as it is on the ms baras a result i really quite enjoyed this im guessing that thorntons manufacture the ms range while giving them some minor tweaks to differentiate them but in the case of the lemon mousse bar at least those little tweaks give the thorntons offering the edgeas i said in the ms review this isnt really a bar for out and out chocolate lovers its a bar for lemon mousse lovers but it is still enjoyable light and refreshing and id certainly be tempted to pick one up againhi dom cheers for the shout out i really wouldnt be surprised if thorntons did have some sort of part to play in the manufacturing of the ms range they both seem remarkably aligned i will have to get round to trying the ms version im not holding out too much hope as you say the lemon is even more concentrated on that version i thought it was too intense on the thorntons i guess i will seevery interesting i think i might do a taste test myself and see who wins what an excuse to eat more chocy bars
my last ice cream sample was this rather interesting idea i always love eating chocolate from lighter to darker so i was looking forward to experiencing that in ice cream or fudge bars i should sayi was a little disappointed though that theyre all wrapped in the same generic white plastic which makes it hard to tell which flavor you have the white is easy to see through the plastic but the milk and dark arent so easily discernible i ended up opening two milks before i got a dark at least once you do have them all out they look obviously different from each other that may not be much to ask for but it doesnt always happenwith the white i was amazed that the singular taste of white chocolate was there not a kind of substitute but it also had a milky taste which as i dont drink milk was a little annoying to methe milk chocolate was a pretty average fudge bar it wouldve been nicer just a little bit smoother the dark was of that variety of dark chocolate flavor thats thick and weird unnaturally heavy yet also too sweet its kind of similar to nesquik maybe if i were eating it more casually i wouldnt say so much but it should still hold up to scrutinizingi still like the idea the quality couldve been better but it wasnt horrible what i think would be nice though is to put all three together maybe onto one ice cream three layers instead of three kinds because the only way to really get the idea i like is to eat all three together like i did and that isnt really recommendedcomments are closed
these unassuming little g tubes of well pastilles have been available in australia for years now and like their dutch makers have tended to be a quiet achiever not garnering lots of international fuss or attention despite the fact that over  of their product is sold overseas and they make  every sixty seconds  droste has been around since  when they started as confectioners selling cups of water chocolate and developing their nowfamous round pastillesthere are twenty g pastilles in each box which makes them nice to sneak into your handbag and share with a mate at the movies or as love chunks and i did scoff them in front of the telly actually thats not being fair  we let the first couple of pastilles from both boxes dissolve slowly in order to fully appreciate the taste before scoffing the rest  we were both extremely impressed with the  dark  it is very smooth and silky instead of gritty like some very dark varieties with a hint of burnt coffee but in a good way finishing off with a buttery cocoa taste at the very endthe milk flavour on the other nowsticky hand was rather cloying  perhaps its merely a european vs antipodean mistranslation but it seemed too milky to our palates tasting a bit like warm milk thats gone past its sell by date and mixed in with a bit too much sugar  not surprisingly the first ingredient is sugar and sugars comprise  of the chocolate compared to  in the extra dark so are these luscious looking chocolates available in the us  i am from el paso texas and would love to try these my blog is mainly about mexican chocolate but im always looking for a new taste sensation in chocolate  nice blogthese are all available at my local supermarket hemkp in sweden but ive never tried them until today i bought the stracciatella white chocolate with cocoa crisp and rice crisp and i liked it a lot  being a lover of white chocolate and chocolate with crispy stuff in it i will have to try the other kinds laterlove these little suckersadd some wilhelmina mints and youre good for any roadtrip or long meetingomgim eating this right now and is so gooooooodi want more xdi live in australia and i have seen the other flavours in a small dutch shop at smithfield nsw does anyone knows if this chocolate is kosher is it marked with any of the kosher stamps like the orthodox unin o uthanks
so when i saw this bar on the shelf in tesco it caught my eye a big bar of after eight with dark chocolate and  both featured prominently on the label obviously someone at nestl is reading chocablogtheyve clearly made a bit of an effort with the presentation too inside the thick paper and gold foil youll find eight large glossy squares of dark chocolate deeply embossed with the after eight logo as soon as you start to unwrap it youre immediately greeted by that familiar overwhelming minty aroma that takes you straight back to  and thats not necessarily a good thingso does this  dark chocolate taste any different from the old plain chocolate well frankly no the chocolate tastes just like it does in classic after eight mints in other words it doesnt taste of much at all granted thats partly because the sweet gooey minty filling overwhelms all other flavours but even when taken in isolation it doesnt have anything special going onglancing at the back of the wrapper i notice the small print still describes this as plain chocolate with peppermint flavoured fondant cream centre it seems they just cant get away from that plainnessbut heres the interesting part despite not being able to muster a great deal of enthusiasm for this i still demolished that bar pretty quickly i guess the conclusion is simple  if you liked the original after eights youll like this if you didnt you wont theyre exactly the samedo you take requests for chocolates to reviewif you do diabetic chocolate reviews would be great  my dad is diabetic and eats a square or  of dark chocolate a day  but has never really tried any of the diabetic ones out there im sure thorntons and boots do them so a review maybe would be wonderfullouise i and the other chocabloggers will keep an eye out to see what i can findlouise keep in mind that depending on how dark your dad likes chocolate to be you can also give  chocolates a try i reviewed the pralus  bar a while ago and i have another one coming upwe even have  chocolate here which is an acquired taste but still rather nice especially with a hot cup of teaand dom  sometimes the old classics of dark chocolate and peppermint are still the bestlike all chocolate in south america  just because you can eat a lot doesnt make it any better all brands of chocolate i found were equally tasteless and very easy to eat given that i was there a month with nothing else to eat i eventually managed to squeeze a bit of taste out  it only went down quickly because i was so desperate for that chocolate feeling in your mouthive tried this bar too and found it dissappointing  especially when after eight used to be my favorite  back in college they were smaller but thicker and filled with mint flavored dark chocolate mousse  they were less sweet and they melted slowly in my mouth  they werent the best quality chocolate that i ever had but were much better tasting and a were the best for their price rangei tried after eight hot chocolate last year and found it quite good but i cant find it anywhere this year is there a reason for thishi i discovered the after eight bar some time ago now yet dont seem to be able to buy it in any shop i have shopped in have you stopped producing bars if so this is a shameplease let me know if you still produce it and where they stock itkind regardslindawhere can i get some pleaseyes that looks familiar probably does to every mom its alright to keep swonihg us the sweet life with bex on that table looking adorable and eating apples though who wants to feel pressure to document all the time outs and laundry not me id rather block those memories out of mind haeither way i agree with your mom no one captures moments like you
ice cream time again when i opened these up to see if they would be distinguishable in a picture if i put them in the same bowl i found myself looking at two identicals one just had some brownie bits hidden in it wheres the swirl of fudge from the box cover so i decided to put them together for the picture just to illustrate you cant tell theyre different kinds at alldefinitely easy to tell this is doublechurned it scoops out of the container and melts quickly which i like because i like to let ice cream melt a little anyway so it doesnt freeze my teeththe french chocolate which i was curious about reminded me of a sort of french vanilla coffee i guess thats where the french part comes from the chocolate fudge brownie tastes much the same but with a little less flavor and the brownies whatever brand brownie pieces never seem to taste right some even taste bad these dont but theyre still not too greatso were looking at some pretty average ice cream here not a fancy dessert or even really a satisfaction to a chocolate craving but if youre just looking for something cool this summer id recommend the french over the odd fudge browniethe triple chocolate breyers is my fave  white milk and dark chocolate yumthis is awesome  im on weigth watchers and one serving is only  point
time for another tale of chocoincidence chocokarma or whatever you wish to call itpicture this its a hot day in august and im in bath town centre my dodgy knee has decided it doesnt want to play and so when my fellow holidaymakers decide they want to nip to the supermarket up the hill i suggest it might be better if i just hang out near the centre of town and do some people watching until they return as i stand loitering by a post box a large gentleman in a tshirt and apron approaches and deposits his post only when he turns his back to me do i see that his tshirt bears the legend i heart chocolate on the back in appropriately chocolatey script naturally my curiosity was aroused and i decided to follow him as you doluckily for my bum knee its only a minute or two before he makes a right turn into a shop and as i reach the premises im delighted to find that hes a chocolatier after a brief introduction i discover that he is none other than phillipe wall a belgian chocolatier and coowner of house of minerva thats him on the left of the photoas im in holiday mode and unable to conserve a large amount of chocolate i elect to buy only a small number of the wide range of chocolates on offer opting for flavours i havent seen before or those recommended by my new friend m wallfirst up is a dark ganache with tea not an advertisement for a s band the chocolate is a well balanced slightly citrussy tasting blend whose initial sharpness is very quickly tempered by a rich and very delicately flavoured filing with a light mouthfeel the tea flavouring isnt too powerful allowing the cocoa flavours from the chocolate and the filling to intermingle on the palate giving a very satisfying finish not the strongest tea chocolate ive had but a very good blending of flavours nonethelessso there we are if youre in or near bath i can highly recommend popping in to house of minerva youll find plenty to please the palate  champagne hot chocolate bars truffles ganaches and a range of excellent valrhona bars as well  and of course the ebullient and very friendly monsieur wallwho knew that stalking could produce such fantastic results  i discovered this minerva myself this weekend  just posting about my trip to bath and was looking for a link to the minerva website but there doesnt seem to be a functioning one any more  so if its ok with you i was going to use this link insteadof course you dont have to ask to link to us done  why dont they have a site of their own  weirdi was given your name on enquiring about chocolate lambs  as i should like to put some around the gingerbread house i am making with my grandson for xmas  if you do them can you post them please  price and postage would be appreciated  many thanks wendy hill
chocablog readers of a sensitive disposition may wish to stop reading here because these are some of the strangest and frankly disgusting looking chocolates ive seen in a long timethe box describes these as  fine belgian flaked truffles i could describe them as something else entirely but as this is a family web site ill let you judge for yourselfif you can get past the initial appearance and try one what youll find is large irregular slightly flaked chocolates with a soft whipped fillingunfortunately these truffles suffer from exactly the same issue they are pleasant but they just dont taste of anything much the milk chocolate is ok but certainly nothing special and the filling tastes of fresh cream but not much else i think this is probably one of those products that seemed like a good idea at the time im quite certain duc do are capable of making fabulous chocolates but this looks bizarre and tastes very ordinary is it just me or these look like ekhm droppingsi have to admit dom that i too had erm suffered through a box of these several years ago clearly the oncedelicate flaked shavings of chocolate dont last a second longer than it took to click the cover photograph and they instead just meld into the ahem nugget to make it look even more stool likeand youre right  they taste so bland and nothingy its an ugly and pointless exercise reallyi disagree entirely i think they taste divine they are often roughed up when shipped so therefoer the flakes dont hold together well  a design issue maybe  but nonetheless on my palate they are yummyi disagree they are the nicest truffles on the planetit doesnt matter what they look like its what they taste like and they taste great i dont think theyre bland however if youre after overpowering chocolates i can see how it may be seen like that i think they have a great combination of flavouri just googled the name because i got some as gift and now want to buy more so obviously disgree with the reviewhave to agree on what they look like never seen chocolates qyite like these before  and ive seen a lot of chocolates lolor even quitewell i think they look exactly like truffles should look just remember how the real truffles look like  would you throw them away just because they look ugly they taste just fantastic  without any too strong aroma mild and delicate adore themrecently visited belgium and all their handmade truffles looks like these
matttastic from lindt never lets me down  he popped into chocolocketts the other day to present me with two clear boxes of lindt lindor balls  the first box was filled with some bronzed little chaps ive heard about and been dying to try for ages  lindor peanut buttermy fellow tasters   year old love chunks and  year old sapphire agreed and neither of them are peanut butter fans  the trouble is that it is extremely difficult to politely eat only one or two or three and our box of eighteen barely lasted one evening  and before you ask the answer is no  no reading of the ingredients panel or fat content was undertaken as that would only spoil thingsthe second box containing lindor orange raspberry and mint balls is a seasonal mix that is likely to start appearing on the shelves as christmas gift ideas  although if youre like me youll have to buy them about six times over again due to eating them yourself before seeing the gift recipientlike a brain surgeon i carefully selected one of each flavour to dissect  its so disappointing when it takes me more than one ball to get the cutting right because it means i have to eat  thats right the endless sacrifices made in this job  the damaged stuff and try again the orange lindor ball is coated in milk chocolate which is nice  thats right just nice because dark chocolate would be even nicer lindt hint hint  the mint is coated in dark and has long been a favourite of mine as the filling is a creamy white chocolate that melts perfectly after the dark coating is gone  the raspberry lindor ball is the only one im not so confident about  it tastes a tiny bit too chemicalish for me and leads me to hope that one day the lindt chefs get confused and add their alreadyfabulous strawberry or pistachio fillings that they use in their milk blocks into the balls instead by mistake  or maybe they have another go at improving the raspberry flavourdoes anyone know where to find these in the usoh im so loving the peanut butter ones an advertising agency i have a few friends at did the campaign for these chocolates in the uk and they had plenty of those around the office needless to say i was a frequent visitor the mint and raspberry ones are gorgeous but the peanut butter variety beats all others an absolute gemi have tried them once and i think they are lindts greatest invention i tried them by mistake in tk max love them and now i cannot find them anywhere probably best for the waist i know carys ive just found them in tk maxx again last weekend and i know they also sell them in selfridges although they didnt have any left last time i checked i was utterly disappointed
stephanie and brittany from klondikes pr firm were nice enough to send me a few samples of chocolate ice cream the first of these being part of a healthconscious line is sugarfree with splenda in its place now i like fudge bars but im part of that group that thinks artificial sweeteners taste bad and are worse for you than real sugar and my favorite fudge bars just hapen to have tofu in them gives them a nice texture that said what did i think of thesewell the first thing i noticed was that the color is a little bland but thats forgiveable considering there are no artifical colors added the problem is that the taste is slightly bland as well more chocolate would help both these causes later on the flavor gets a bit stronger tasting more like brownie than fudge the good thing is that you cant tell it doesnt have sugar and neither could i taste any splenda and of cuorse the frothy feel characteristic of a fudge bar of it is nicebut there are better fudge bars out there tofu kind than these though maybe they kept the ingredients short to fit into a hundred calories so if thats important to you sure these taste fine but i know it isnt one of my priorities i go for taste first and these arent at the very top in that categoryhave you tried skinny cow fudgesicles theyre the best
there are two main differences between the original bueno and this oneas you can see it cant even sit still long enough to be photographed without shedding its skin sorry cocoa decoration everywhere im quite sure that kinder designed this bar with good intentions but it really is impossible to eat without getting bits of cocoa everywherebut those tiny granules of cocoaflaoured stuff do give a slightly more chocolatey flavour than most white chocolate bars as well as adding a little bit of texture both to the chocolate and to my desk and clothesmessiness aside this bar retains all the good features of the original bueno the crispy wafer and smooth hazelnut filling make it deliciously creamy and light its delicious but i dont think ill be buying another simply because i dont believe in chocolate that takes longer to clean up after than it does to eat if you can cope with the mess you can buy it online from amazon links below and other reputable dealers of messy chocolatecouldnt you just lick the tablewhat do you take me for of course i licked the tablei reckon bueno white is as brilliant as the original one i never found bueno white messier though and it changed my perception of the strong vanilla flavor of any normal white chocolatejust as good as the original one and the mess its no big deal after all who said licking the table could harm youi absolutely love the white chocolate kinder buenos  more than the normal kind i thinki also think its great when i tip all the chocolate granule things into my mouth at the end dyumi love kinder bueno whitei love these who cares about the mess its so so worth it mmm yum xdhellothats hazeldo you read the packagingdwe love kinder bueno white i realli love kinder bueno white love to the max love it love it love it love it love it di love kinder white i love kinder buenos too the same yummy taste of the bueno cream still remains in kinder white kinder white is sooo yummy yes the hazelnut mess is inevitable but at the end i just pick them from the table and pop them into my mouth i think the white kinder bueno is absolutely gorgeous and im currently very much hooked on them i didnt find them very messy at all some of the hazelnut bits are left in the bottom of the packet but i enjoy eating those at the end i would certainly recommend them to a friend delicious i do love kinder bueno and the new white on is the best but i was disapointed when i found a hair in my last one i dont think ill buy any more not satisfiedhmnmmmmabsolutely amazing love the texture from the little cocoa bits  had my first today and it wont be my last  also wasnt as messy as described perhaps because i popped out each piece individually from the clear wrapper
so in keeping with my character there i was this morning clad in my cleanest grey tracksuit pants pushing through the hordes of pensioners looking for cheap biscuits down at my local supermarket when i saw a new twix on the horizon caramel latte  of course i bought two of them and two of the originals in order to compare the classic with the newbiemars own the twix brand and are to use an aussie term crackin a cadbury by reducing the weight of the newer flavour in order to sell it for the same price as the original bar im being nitpicky here though because theres only a  gram differential  g for the bogstandard twixaroonie and g for the caramel latte but im mentioning it here so that the big boys know that we little folk are aware of their little schemes to maximise profits by surreptitiously reducing sizeslove chunks my partner in crime because he was working from home today and insisted that a happy marriage means sharing everything and i had a reminder taste of the original  always good  nice crunchy biscuit centre sweet soft flowing caramel pleasant enough milk chocolate  ive always liked them but never found them particularly filling thats why i bought two but forgot about love chunks being home so have tended not to buy them when im hungry and have overlooked them when craving some top quality dark stuffas the wrapper opened on the new bar a really noticeable and inviting smell of coffee wafted up which is a nice touch for a pedestrian bar  as you can see if they were taken out of their packets and swapped youd be struggling to tell the difference between them so the sweet coffee smell would helpmmm hmmm this coffee one is so much better murmured love chunks whod thoughtfully poured himself a glass of icy cold iced coffee to accompany it  i agree entirely  still the same crunchy biscuit and okey dokey milk chocolate covering and the caramel is exactly the same consistency albeit with a nice latteflavour inserted  no actual coffee is listed in the ingredients so its a victory for chemicals and additives in this casethe only reason we dont have much of the basic everyday chocs on chocablog is because we reviewed most of them two years ago but they are equally welcome here wow where can i get myself some of thesei adoooore twix lolanother version of twix that i didnt know about d ill keep a look out ill see if i can find any on an internet shopping site hopefully i will
once its in your mouth they blend together well the coffee is definitely there but it isnt overpowering either one odd thing was that it was present in little tiny bits usually theyre bigger but these seemed like the guatemala casi ciel ground coffee had just been casually dumped innot bad starbucks not bad although i cant help but wonder if its a coincidence that the most promising of these three is the one with coffee is it because thats what starbucks does bestcomments are closed
ms seem to do a whole range of these little bars but i didnt pay much attention as i grabbed one from the shelf while passing through marylebone station the wrapper describes the bar as white and dark chocolate bar with a light lemon mousse centre on a lemon parfait baseand thats a fairly accurate description both the parfait and mousse are extremely lemony and despite the plethora of artificial sounding ingredients on the packaging tastes quite natural the mousse is light fluffy and zesty and the white chocolate is sweet and creamy but not overly soone of the issues i often have when lemon and white chocolate are used together is that unless done exceptionally well you often get a hint of sickliness when the intense citrus flavour and rich creaminess combine there is a hint of that here but its barely noticeableunfortunately the other thing thats barely noticeable is the chocolate only at the very last second do you get any hint of the dark chocolate taste and even then theres so little of it that its impossible to discern qualityso this really isnt a bar for chocolate lovers its a bar for lemon mousse lovers personally i found it quite delicious but you certainly shouldnt buy one expecting any kind of chocolate hit from ithi dom over at cm i reviewed the equivalent thorntons bar  who copied who i dont know anyway i found exactly the same things wrong with it  really lacking in its chocolate qualities good pictures btwjimjames thanks for the tip  i guess that thorntons make the range of bars for ms given thorntons is a chocolate maker and i dont think ms make any of their own stuffill see if i can buy a matching set from thorntons  ms sometime and compare them
and yet they force me to consider loving them again when they introduce these minttastic mms and even took the time to email me with the news  no actual samples alas just an email which is kind of like presenting stevie wonder with a magic eye drawing and asking him to explain the imagery he can find in itoh well several weeks went by and no minttastics were found anywhere  and believe me i looked because dark chocolate and mint are right up in my alltime favourite flavour combinations  finally they appeared at my local supermarket and were on special clearly hoping to encourage the plain mm lovin traditionalists to give them a tryinstead these newer better and muchmoredeservingofyourtime minttastic mms are very minty  quite strong in fact  perhaps even slightly too overpowering for some palates who may find that the dark chocolate is almost lost between the fresh breath flavour and the crispy shell  still its a nice way to freshen ones breath after an evening meal  or after breakfasti luv this websitee i luv m and ms lol xxlots of love darci xx
this bar also shares the milks vanilla smell and taste and you know what else i think its just as sweet it tastes of chocolate and sugar with a tiny hint of bitterness but what steps it up from other chocolates is that it maintains a smooth yet not a sticky texture a quite nice one as wellthe  oz bar which may come from the same source is made in ireland
ive been doing chocablog for nearly two and a half years now and one of the things that still surprises me is that there are still many fairly large chocolate companies that we havent even talked about valrhona is one such company but now their products are readily available in waitrose  i think its about time we gave them a goi did try to find out more information via their official web site but alas it seems they hired the writing team from allo allo to write the content but at least now i know that in the light of increasing uniformisation of flavours and culinary standards valrhona has decided to take action to study promote and valorise taste in our societythe rather extensive blurb on the back of the bar itself calls it chocolate with a longtasting distinctive flavour mild yet rich in cocoa with notes of caramel and vanilla deliciously set off by a touch of maltok so i get the general idea but surely it wouldnt be that difficult to hire a decent translator time to let the chocolate speak for itselfluckily the chocolate is more than capable of standing on its own put simply its one of the nicest milk chocolates ive ever hadtheres really only one way to eat this place half a square on your tongue and just let it melt away and release its flavours slowly first you get a malty slightly nutty flavour then the chocolate flavour slowly builds this is a  milk chocolate so that flavour is quite distinct and doesnt get lost in the sweetness and creaminess the only problem is its all too easy to demolish this g bar in a matter of minutes  and its not cheap this is the kind of bar that should be eaten slowly savoured and preferably sharedalas i have no self control so im just off out to buy some more oh welli am sojealous im nearly but not quite speechlessvahrlona was always a chocolate that poncy overseas chefs always seem to cite in our gourmet cooking magazines to make their recipes out of reach and exclusive regarding their dessert recipes g chopped high quality chocolate preferably vahrlona and it would make my eyeballs bleed with rage jealousy and utter frustration that it wasnt available at my version of waitrose coles and i didnt have the funds to pick some up on my way home from my latest european summer sojournam looking forward to your review of their dark varieties if you can get itour local greengrocer has a deli section which stocks vahrlona along with serveral other high end chcolate bars never quite buy any but it is nice knowing they are there is i ever have the urge to make a fancy chocolate dessertmanjari by valrhona is by far my favorite  dark  its so good i dont even chew it just let it melt
the exhigh school english teacher within me tends to avoid buying products that deliberately misspell common words so i had seen these plantation rype boxes for a while before giving in and buying somethe rypesters eventually won me over because i love ginger and dark chocolate and lets face it pretty well any packaging that promises delicious ginger and appleorange fruit centres smothered in rich dark chocolate  despite being made in australia some of the statements on the packaging sounded suspiciously nonaussie telling us that these simple chocolate balls represent the harmony of our creations and one full sentence that confidently announces the unification of tastes and flavours that we have mastered  okaaaayunfortunately their bold claims are somewhat unfounded when put to the taste test  granted were conditioned to having our fruit balls and scorched nuts encased in an ultrafine layer of sugar coating to give them their desired glossy look but these are almost crispy  so crispy in fact that the actual flavour of the chocolate is nullified before tasting the orangeginger or appleginger fillingthe ingredients lists dont fare too well either  the dark chocolate has a relatively paltry  cocoa content and the ginger in both flavours is a tiny  of the nonchocolate ingredients  orange is only  of the total fruit ingredient which in itself makes up only  of each ball with the chocolate consisting of  with apple being marginally higher at   there are three glazing agents listed    and  im no mathematician or scientist but the sturdy plasticky taste of the coating over the chocolate suggests that they could lose at least two of those numbers  the other ingredients didnt sound too thrilling either  including emulsifiers preservative  semolina maltodextrin glycerine vegetable oil vegetable gums and mineral saltthe overall taste is of a hardish chocolate with no discernible flavour coating some kind of chewy gingery fruity filling  it was sapphire my trustworthy nine year old critic who read the front of the boxes which say delicious ginger and appleorange fruit centres smothered in rich dark chocolate who said they should take out delicious rich and dark and then it would be rightwell said  the packaging is unexciting as is the actual chocolate  theyll have to do more than improve their spelling to get another purchase from mecomments are closed
this was a very pleasant surprise on my first trip to the discount store tuesday mornings the retail price said sixteen dollars i think thats an exaggeration of the actual price but i paid three there are six boxes about twobytwo each of what look like flattened chocolate chips each box marked with a percentage hence the numbers in the namenow for three dollars i think this is a remarkable find i love the  and  and i think that the boxes are very cute but full price seems way too much i wouldnt be willing on paying more than eight dollars and even thats pushing it so if you ever see these on sale pick them up theyre fun but be wary if theyre full price in that case id recommend buying the individual boxes instead of a set so you can leave out at least the two darker onesis there anywhere you can buy chocolate by numbers in canada
whats great about kathleen is that she makes her chocolates fresh and to order selling them both online and at a local farmers marketthe first thing you notice about these chocolates is the rich dark belgian chocolate its smooth and glossy and has a wonderful aroma the second thing you notice is that all the fondant fillings look the same no matter what the flavour thats presumably because no artificial colours flavours or additives are used in any of crymbles chocolates while im all for natural ingredients i think id have liked to have seen some subtle colouring to differentiate the flavours i also found them to be a little too firm for my liking the taste was spot on but the texture was just a little too solid if they could be made a little fluffier or even more liquid then they would be perfect the dark chocolate itself was delicious and tasted every bit as good as it looked the wonderful flavour complemented the sweetness of the fillings perfectlyso while these arent really anything like the old frys five centre bar they are definitely worth trying and the rest of crymbles range of chocolates look quite tempting toocomments are closed
as i mentioned in my review of the alcoholic bars most of the stainer chocolate ive seen and the majority of those currently in my possession come in lavishly illustrated boxes quite unlike anything ive seen beforequite a serious amount of extra flavours there and given that they were blended with milk rather than dark chocolate i was curious as to whether the spices would overpower the chocolateits definitely not horrible but at the same time it didnt have me wanting more the combination of flavours left me wondering what the chocolate would have tasted like on its own mildly disappointing a little odd but still a very good milk chocolateinteresting too your comment on the illustration on the box because my first thought was isnt it nice that the artwork between teh two world wars is still being used  im such a philistine
twelve squares instead of their usual ten so there was no squabbling for that mystical fourth piece out of ten in our three person household  and the taste  wow this was a genuine revelation  milk chocolate  yes its sweet yes its very creamy but yes its extremely delicious and dare i write this but as and moreish as dark chocolate  the wafer filling was delicately thin and folded over via some inexplicably elegant feat of modern engineering and had a lovely crunch with a hint of toffee for that extra crispy crackle  the hazelnut cream revealed itself to the senses a few moments later blending in expertly with the milk chocolate after the final crunch of the wafer had gone  this milk chocolate was truly superb and i never thought that things as humble and everyday as a wafer and hazelnut could be so divinethis block is like the unsung sidekick to the superhero the lone rangers tonto batmans robin or snickers mr t   despite the unassuming packaging shyly hiding behind the pistachio crme and the  excellence this lovely block is just as deserving of accolades attention and my appetiteoh i love this version of the lindt bar it is such a great taste and i am a huge fan of filled chocolate  nice reviewthanks franzi ill get another block of this and as i sink my teeth into it ill think of your kind words  havent seen the block version of this one but one day i found a twixlike double finger in one of my local shops needless to say i tried it  and instantly became a fan waffles add texture and the chocolate is delicious creamy milky sumptuous well after all its lindt
when i first saw this line of chocolate i wasnt sure what to expect was it just some average chocolate parading under the starbucks banner for people to supplement their breakfast coffee with im not a coffee drinker so i couldnt try and imagine how the quality of starbucks coffee would transfer to coffee so there was only one thing to do give it a tryit really looks quite decent the packaging gives off an air of everyday sophistication and the motto when coffee dreams it dreams of chocolate okay i think we know who theyre targeting here all those people who wait half an hour in line every morning to treat themselves to some starbucks coffee i guess thats why they dont bother to mention the cacao contentbut i myself sat for a while with this bar trying to decide what i thought i like it and now ive come to the conclusion that its nice for under three dolllars for  grams it fits its intended purpose and might even drage some newcomers to its audience but ill have to try some more before i put too much faith in that last partreally missed out on this one maybe the next time im back there
this bar is the usual  dark blend that lindt use for the range but it also contains tiny crystals of sea salt  to be precisenow you may not consider  to be a great deal of salt but once you sample a piece of this chocolate it isnt very long before you start finding the crystals melting on your tonguein my conversations with various chocolatiers here and in europe i have noticed that they tend to look down on lindt i suppose it must be because the company identity retains some of the chocolatier feel whereas the reality has to be a series of huge factories churning out truckloads of chocolate bars for every country in europe and probably most of the world however they have achieved consistently high standards in terms of flavour and variety and i suppose its for that reason they have maintained a very high share of the marketwell this is definitely one to look out for if lindt is your thing i found the pairing very moreish indeedvery cool reviewregarding your chocolatier experience  consumers and chocolatiers are two very different targets  chocolatiers tend to look at the workability of chocolate ie how is it going to work with my machines does it melt well will it melt or stay firm when i bake cookies etc  thats why the chocolate industry is fairly well divided between bb chocolate for chocolatiers and bc chocolate for consumers  there are hardly any companies that succeed in bothi think this is a really interesting discussion lindt are obviously a large company so i can understand smaller boutique chocolatiers may look down on them  but they do consistently produce great productsim just another chocoholic with a steady supply to feed his addiction i like some of lindt chocolate to buti would have never thought of seasalt in chocolate buti am truely wondering how salty i mean i like chocolate buti dont like the taste of alot of salt so i guess i might try itive had my eye on a sea salt bar for a while now but there are always so many more that i always end up getting something else instead im really curious to try it thoughthe lovely matt from lindt here in south australia mentioned the sea salt variety but ive yet to see it here and believe ive been lookingoh and  salt is very salty  thats about all there is in sea water isnt it or has my year  biology learnings failed methe idea of salt and chocolate for me was a little foreign then i tried a seasalt truffle by raymond lammers exec pastry chef at stein eriksen a couple of years back and i was blown away i would actually love to see some reviews of small chocolate shops and innovative chocolatiers  theres a pastry chef out of spain that fills his chocolate truffles with roasted garlic and sauteed onions  now thats a review id love to check outwatch this space  i found another small chocolatier while on holiday last month my first uk chocolatier review is imminenti tried sea salt chocolate in portugal last week and wish i had bought more to bring back to the ukany idea where i can buy itit says  salt on my box  would not taste very nicei thought id add my  worth  i bought one of these bars once and loved it  now im having trouble finding it on the shelves in canada  i actually came across this discussion in an attempt to secure a supplyjust got sent some of the salt chocolate from a friend in sweden its absolutely gorgeousone of the greatest chocolates i have ever triedi also came across this blog in search for the elusive lindt sea salt  it is the best choc i have eaten in an age and i want to get some more  am now hooked on choc blogs sighit tastes awesome  however  it is not really dark chocolate  i am allergic to milk chocolate and i bought this lindt dark chocolate with a touch of sea salt without reading the label assuming it was really dark chocolate  but at only  cocoa and with added butterfat milk the dark chocolate label is misleading  i can eat real dark chocolate with no adverse effects but milk chocolate makes me break out  this chocolate also contains cholesterol due to the milk fat  they should not market it as dark chocolate  it doesnt have the health benefits of real dark chocolate which has  cocoa or more  it does taste delicious though  the added salt gives it a slight caramel flavor  amazing  glad to have tasted it but i will never buy it again and lindt has lost favor with me for its misleading labeljust tasted my first few bites of this and had to search and see what others are saying i really like this for the price it was the cheapest on the shelf at target this is really goodi finally tried some of this very nice i thought salt and chocolate are two very wonderful things after allthis is my favourite chocolate ever simple as thati just tried this too and really loved it i cant honestly say that of any other chocolates ive had in a long time if ever that includes a number of ones that were considered artisanal or otherwise premiumsea salt chocolate so you mean lindt stole this idea from the chef in south park whos sick idea was it to actually suck on chocolate salty balls freaks
im not sure if its just an aussie thing or more global but it seems like there are a lot of smalltime chocolate makers who sell to other larger firms or specialty stores only for their products to be rebranded under the purchasers labelthus i present you with chocolates on parade milk and dark orange chocolate blocksi bought both blocks home to try because cottage box chocolates were started in my hometown of murray bridge in  incidentally the same year i left home to go to university  theyve since moved to the more salubrious and touristy town of hahndorf in the adelaide hills and theyre on my must visit listthe plain milk chocolate neglected to include any ingredients on the label other than the confident statement milk chocolate only  no fancy logo is stamped on any of the large chunks but it smelled good  annoyingly after only a couple of chunks my fillings were aching this was the most sugary sweet milk chocolate ive tasted in a long time  bordering on the excessive as it made me extremely thirsty  the nine year old on the other hand loved it  this was unusual because her alltime favourite chocolate is lindts   was i missing somethingit was time to give up on the milk and to instead sink my teeth into the orange cream dark block  this did include the ingredients and it wasnt surprising to see sugar listed as number one and fondant and glucose ie two other types of sugar included further down  my expectations dropped a notch or two as i bit into it  again it was very sweet and i could taste some sugar crystals within the cream centre  the orange centre was almost fluoro in colour and rather runny making it impossible to take a photo of a chunk sliced in two before it escaped like an underdone egg yolk  it did taste pleasantly of orange though unfortunately the sickly sugariness of the chocolate threatens to overtake the orange when it is normally preferable to have the orange flavour linger after the chocolate has meltedmy verdict is one of disappointment but im aware that cottage box are more well known for their marzipan peppermint mice the shape folks not the ingredient turkish delight and freckles  ill try them with hope in my heart and tolerance in my taste budsso where exactly is this chocolates on parade considering how you  wax poetical on peanut butter mms im going to have to stick my nose in there next time im in adelaideoff norwood parade hence the name in the arcade that holds coles supermarket gloria jeans and the moo yoghurt shop  make sure you leave some of the peanut butter mms there for me kay
as you can see the format is exactly the same eight small bars of dairy milk tastefully wrapped in foil perfect for sharing but even better for keeping for yourselfinside the bars look exactly the same as the dark chocolate variety  only the filling has been changed to protect the innocentthis sounds pretty good i will have to try it because i like cadbury chocolate and also like the original dairy milk chocolate bar toi absolutely adore the cabury splended tastepodre hektora czyli poszukiwanie szczcia 
cocoa farms beans are grown in the warmth of tropical north queensland i so wish theyd invite me to come and stay for a while and the business and manufacturing is done further south in colder melbourne  in addition to making organic blocks they are rapidly becoming famous  and loved  for their wine chocolates  merlot pinot noir and shiraz their wine drops dried wine grapes coated in dark chocolate and their sugar free blocks i previously reviewed their mango lime and chilli flavourtheir organic dark chocolate orange however has been the one ive been most wanting to try  orange and chocolate is one of my all time favourite flavour pairings and i was keen to see if the cocoa farms  gold and silver award winning products were worth the hyperbole  and the price tag  at six dollars for a g block they are not cheap by cadbury or nestle standards so my expectations were running high it needed to give me a decent bang for my buck as you can see the squares arent adorned with any sexy logo and were a little bit crumbly  mostly because i accidentally dropped the block on the floor before i opened it  they also arent particularly glossy but thats neither here nor there for me  how do they tasteah not yet my pretties  at  minimum cocoa solids and all organic ingredients including orange oil and puree the scent was calling out my name the moment the golden cocoa bean wrapper was slashed open  despite being described as being spiked with zesty pieces of orange they werent visible to the naked eyebut to the tongue and tastebuds they most definitely were  the nottoostrong dark chocolate had a lovely dusty coffee flavour that easily melted in the mouth and left some gorgeously moist and flavoursome orange pieces to savour at the end  mmm theres some nice chewy bits when the chocolates disappeared was how my nine year old described it is there any morealas no  one hundred measly grams is a very cruel measure for a block and we picked up every little crumb that was lingering on the plate  top notch stuffthis sounds like something for me to try out i like chocolate and orange and well the natural ingredients an how you explained it seems pretty yummyi am interested in knowing how you deal with pathogens  insects in this organic cocoa farmsi want to plant  acres of organic cocoareguarding john segu quartey and the enquiry about organic pest control had he thought about neem plant peicesseed husks in the soil this should sort most pestswe have acres of cocoa land for sale in indiainterested in buying cocoa land for salei am looking for about  acres of land in the cocoa growing belt of west africa for an organic cocoa farmwe are promoting cocoa farm lands in india and selling the sameproposed land is suitable for cocoa cultivationour website ram plantationcomwhat kind of yields should one expect from an organic cocoa farmusing best agronomic practices
this little box was picked up at the grocery store on sale from  to  its not the most unique looking but still inviting enough so i thought it was worth a tryim partial to coffee in chocolate so these chocolates had no trouble finding a home but for eight dollars there are better ways to spend your money sure theyre nice and creamy but too sweet and greasy to go out of your way to geti am not a blogger person but i love to read your comments on chocolate i love it but have to cut down because of health issues age too so i live through your comments  keep up the good workthis sounds good i like mocha coffee in chocolate but the price that sounds kinda high so i dont know butit does sound good anyway
this is part of a range made by benedict a family run business which has been operating in ljubljana for some fifteen years or sowhen i was asked what sorts of chocolate id be interested in i asked for something unique to slovenia and with this bar barica came up trumpsit has a good dark colour to it a pleasant glossy sheen and a rich aroma the wine content has made the chocolate a little softer than one might expect and lends it a very pleasant subtly alcoholic note to the overall taste when tasting this chocolate the slightly sweet winey top notes are there seconds before the darker more complex cocoa flavours as the cocoa notes build on the palate you taste deep chocolatey flavours with hints of coffee and tobacco and the finish is a lively blend of bittersweet cocoa and a soft mildly alcoholic notemaybe its not a sic after all  if they have that many varieties maybe slovenian sweat is one of them
so instead of the rather tempting looking white vanilla balls the box shows what we have here is  large thin squares of dark chocolate with a white vanilla filling equally tempting but they just as well have shown pictures of fluffy orange sheep on the front and ff they had i would almost certainly still have bought itthe dark chocolate is listed as  cocoa solids so its not particularly dark but it is very nice nestl havent exactly been generous with the chocolate here but the flavour still comes through despite the sweetness of the vanilla filling insideand make no mistake this is a very sweet very rich bar it demands to be eaten delicately one square at a time rather than being stuffed into your mouth in one go  however tempting that might be and in the interests of science i did of course try this that vanilla truffle filling while delicious isnt particularly light its soft and creamy but so rich it could almost contain alcohol but theres none of that listed on the ingredientsdom i love this sentence it demands to be eaten delicately one square at a time rather than being stuffed into your mouth in one go  however tempting that might be and in the interests of science i did of course try this youre a man after my own heartid still like to try the bar though  its a flavour we dont have here in australiakath i know for a fact that there are a few people from nestl who read chocablog i think you should make your voice heard and demand what is rightfully yours hmmm  please  ill be your best friendthis sounds good dark chocolate with vanilla in it i like that combo in chocolate to buthearing how rich its i might just only eat alittle bit at one time it does sound good though
until you open the tins that is the dark chocolate flakes on the left are distinctly darker with that familiar heavenly aroma the milk flakes are on the right and also invited me to stick my nose in and inhale their sweet invitation  matt told me that the chocolate is literally just shaved straight from a large block so if i was desperate i could just dip a spoon in and eat it  handy to know for any future hard times or if noone else was aroundlike all good hot chocolates it doesnt pay to be stingy with the servings and lindt is a proud supporter of this view stating that six teaspoons are the recommended amount per cup  they suggest blending the flakes with about half a cup of milk which is then microwaved for about  seconds per cup  then the mixture is stirred topped up with more milk and microwaved again giving it a thorough stir when it is taken out  this photograph gives you a good idea as to what sixty seconds of effort produced  no the biscuits didnt magically appear sapphire and i made them  the drink itself looked fluffy and fragrant and just what we wanted on a cold winters afternoonno sugar is needed as theres enough in the chocolate itself and even though we used skim milk it still produced an attractive crema found in the top quality coffees made by skilled baristas  and the taste  how does one describe it without resorting to clichs  liquid velvet for the tongue like waves of warm love rolling amongst a field of taste buds or as though uma thurman or george clooney had reincarnated themselves as a hot drink that was waiting yearning dreaming only of you  pretty bloody fantastic in other wordsbut is the dark chocolate one dairy freeanabels i dont know but its worth remembering you can make hot chocolate from any good quality chocolate remember these flakes are just shaved off a big block of chocolate  just buy a block of your favourite chocolate melt some and add milkwatersugarwhatever to tastethat reminds me of the cadbury hot chocolate which also came in flakes i dont know if they still make that havent seen it around in a long time but i remember enjoying it very much i hope i can find these lindt ones here at least  i love the thick hot chocolate you get with flakeshello i stumbled upon your wonderful blog googling for lindt white coconut reviews im now a subscriber the last paragraph on this post made me laugh i was about to say the same as melissa  how could she not buy you one that is just cruelwhat is also cruel is putting up pics like that when its pm and i havent eaten since braekfast  that just looks so damn good  and is it really that easy to makechocmint lindt is going on the weekly shopping list  i have got to try making that
the contents turned out to be wafer thin fragments of dark chocolate   to be precise  which contained little grains  of mintiness the moment i popped a few pieces in my mouth i knew this was mint brittle like a breath of fresh air the mint element swept through my mouth and completely took over my tastebuds it was quite a shock just how minty this stuff was  there was almost no room for the chocolate flavours to come through until the initial flood of flavour from the little crystals settled down a bit and i could discern a little more of the dark cocoa flavours lurking beneathif youre a fan of minty chocolate and i know there are a few in my house judging from the requests for more then id suggest tracking some of this stuff down it scores big on both mint and chocolate and its handmade by some very nice irish ladies in a lovely part of the worldthanks a million we all love our mint brittle in the factory it also comes in lemon in dark and orange in milkorange is my favfunny i knew about chocolate bark but chocolate or mint brittle now thats something new to me i thought there was only peanut brittle
a friend gifted me with this pretty knowing my adoration for chocolate i dont think i had ever had it before so the first thing i noticed was the pink i cant help but admire what a gentle yet royal shade it isill admit i have a nostalgic fondness for ghirardelli im not sure that they ever come up with any terribly new and exciting ieas but they always seem safe and nice this chocolate has one of those sweetdark smells the raspberry filling is very sweet but is tempered by the chocolate it has a slight milky creaminess reminiscent of a cherry cordialoftentimes so much sweetness turns out to be a bad thing but here its fine plus ghirardelli doesnt call it by ridiculous offthemark names and i appreciate that its simply a nice little raspberry square to treat yourself withthe packaging reminds me of cheese for some reason
this chocolate cousin on the other hand is the exact opposite of awful  awesome in fact  this isnt because cadbury are using their  dark chocolate because theyre using their  standard old gold dark stuff but because it matches up with the peppermint filling extremely welleven love chunks who isnt as fond as peppermint and chocolate as i am enjoyed this  the peppermint is stronger in flavour than the green fluoro snot encased in the dairy milk block so it cuts through the dark and remains as a refreshing after taste long after the chocolate has melted and disappeared  as such i wouldnt recommend eating this during the day  it is instead designed to have late in the evening after a hearty meal and should not be eaten with a glass of wine unless you actually prefer not having any tooth enamel leftif youre watching your fat intake as i am but that doesnt mean im doing anything about it other than watching it then you may be slightly pleased to find out that this block contains  grams of fat per  grams  lets not go into the sugar content but just reassure ourselves that the peppermint filling is taking up the space that is normally reserved for the fat in chocolate and yet it still tastes delicious  oh ok if youre still analretentively concerned about the sugar then heres the grim fact  it constitutes a whopping  of the total ingredients  damn  oh well if youre still determined to eat a g of this stuff and yes of course i did you may be pleased to discover that you have also eaten  whole grams of protein  must be from all those milk solids and egg whitei am addicted to the green peppermint cream and very annoyed that i can not get it i brought kgms back from australia to the uk last time i went and hate the new stuffi love this one its been in new zealand for years you know but even better over there d using energy chocolate
had my spanish been up to scratch i would have known that crackania are almonds and coco referred to the coconut that they had been rolled in after being coated in chocolate but as it was i liked the enigmatic styling of the pot and picked crackania al coco because i really wasnt sure what awaited me once i popped the lid offas it turned out it was this  a collection of white chocolate coated almonds rolled in coconut shavings with a nice little pile of coconut in the bottom of the tin a somewhat unusual method of packaging but i already knew that chocolat factory were a little strange anywaymy initial reaction was one of mild disappointment  more bland white chocolate boorrrrrinnng however i was in for a shock the addition of coconut and a little extra aromas and epices meant that what could have been quite run of the mill ended up being a very pleasant surprise indeed the combination of the coconut and almond worked remarkably well with the white chocolate and i detected a hint of salt in there to balance what might have ended up being yet more overly sweet white chocolate the almonds were crisp and seemed to have been lightly caramelised so that once the white chocolatecoconut exterior had gone i was left with a completely different tasting caramelalmond complex to taste and it was definitely a case of these chocs saving the best for lastbased on my thus far limited experience of chocolat factory products i think its pretty safe to say that ill be trying to track more of their products down when i next visit spain which is in september so hopefully ill have time to fill a small sack with more of their stuff id definitely recommend keeping an eye out for anything made by chocolat factorythey seem to be yet another fresh young company with a flair for producing slightly unusual mildly humorous productsthe spanish word for almonds is almendras i have no idea what crackania means but i dont think practicing your spanish would have helpedthey look delicioushi
the first thing that didnt seem right about this set was that although it has three chocolates from different origins theyre all different percentages cacao wouldnt it make more sense to have them all the same so that you can taste the slight differences the beans causethe second thing was that the first ingredient is sugarthe  from java didnt encourage me much it has a pleasant vanilla taste but is such a sweet and sticky mess the  arriba was more promising it definately has a middletone darkness then gets just as the bag describes a floral taste that was a little shocking at first but soon became gentle and nicethe thrid chocolate a  from sao tome started off bitter before slowing down with a light far off sweetness to keep it tame i enjoyed it although it was a bit plasticyim impressed these chocolates actually had some flavor besides sugar and good flavors at that still not my favorite but if you find yourself in front of a selection of hersheys these might be one of the better choicesweve had fun dissecting hersheys sugar based products here before and i seem to recall that it was the ridiculously high sugar content that was the problem before compared with your previous reviews id say it was a pretty safe bet that you wont be rushing out for more hersheys eitheryes i really dont consider hersheys chocolate most of the time its candy ill have to get a hersheys bar up here soon though just so i can explain why i dont like itactually the arriba is the best chocolate bar ive ever had i prefer dark chocolate and despise the really sweet candy bars ordinarily but the arriba is amazing with a different taste from any ive had beforeand like anything else that proves itself to be the best ive ever had hersheys has now made this particular type of chocolate bar impossible to findwhy get me hooked on this stuff only to discontinue itthanks a lot hersheysi do agree i think these are fairly decent that and the hershey bliss and kisses i was wondering do you have any openings open to be a reviewer or part of the blog reviewer team please let me knowi am so mad right now i need my cacao reserve and i cannot find it anywhere that was the best chocolate i every had and now its gone i feel like a  year old when they dont get what they want sooooo bad
i love specialty shops you know the kind of place small independent places that you find tucked away down some back street usually run by a slightly mad middleaged woman who has turned her lifelong passion for crocheted bunny rabbits into a business of course id never actually buy anything from one of these places but its good to know they exist so that other slightly mad middleaged women have somewhere to go to satisfy their own woolen leporine fetishesso imagine a specialty shop dedicated to chocolate sounds good but not particularly specialist right well imagine it was dedicated to one particular chocolate manufacturer still not specialist enough for youluckily they were kind enough to send us some samples of their range er raisin  biscuit yorkies which somehow we have neglected to review thus farnow ive never been a particular fan of yorkies i think thats partly down to the slightly bizarre marketing campaigns theyve hadthe g bar contains five big chunks of above average milk chocolate with just the right amount of small pieces of biscuit to give it a bit of crunch and just enough raisins to give it a slight chewy texture and a bit of a fruity tang but make no mistake this is still mainly thick milk chocolateits thick and tasty with a bit of crunchy chewiness thrown in for good measurequite obviously the chocolate isnt on a par with the likes of lindt or hotel chocolat but it doesnt need to be you dont eat lindt because youre hungry or need a quick chocolate fix and you dont eat yorkie in order to indulge your sensesim quite certain ill be looking out for one of these next time im out and in need of something filling   definitely worth a try  even if youre a girlno dom come on this has to be a joke im officially the biggest sucker ever so im actually believing you about the existance of this shopim speechless pictures please jimjames its just an online shop but its realim so amused by the idea that yorkies are not for girls but theyre raisin and biscuit  sounds pretty girlie to mei was still living in the sweet shop when yorkie launched raisin  biscuit i didnt realise theyd been around almost thirty years thats pretty good goingi love the biscuit and raisin varient because if like me youre allergic to nuts you cant try to the fruit  nut chocolates so this gives us nut haters a chance to try that same sort of consistencybut its true you cant find them much these days you used to be able to thoughhang on  youve never had a rb yorkie and you run a chocolate sitehow weird is thatsimon i dont drive a truck i didnt think i was allowed yorkiei love the biscuit and raisinam i the only person to remember the nine chunk yorkie advertised with the slogan big enough to satisfy the driver and his mate displayed with a young drivers mate holding the yorkie bar at a jaunty angle and both smiling at one anotheri think it lasted on the bill boards for about one weeki tried this and loved it i couldnt really taste the raisins but the biscuit was lovely and as usual the rich yorkie chocolate was very tasteful
the lovely barbara gave me a range of their products to try all of which are made in mclaren vale south australia  close cousin to the barossa valley in terms of fame for wines they use belgian chocolate for their products but local ingredients for their fillings  their flavoured jellies also known as pectins for purists who know about real jellies and not the chemicalladen ones are already famous in australia and when combined with good quality chocolate theyre just begging to be eatenmini pecs sounds like theyre a tiny box of muscles and in a way they are  these gorgeous halforbs of milk chocolatesmothered turkish delight were utterly delicious  nine year old sapphire and i love turkish delight but have struggled to find something that has good chocolate cadburys is ok with a good filling cadburys is most definitely not ok and with these we have found it  the delicate rosey fragrance also contributes to the enjoyment of them and these smelled as delicious as they tasted  id love to know if they also do them in a dark chocolate style as well because as with caramel i think that dark chocolate would pair up magnificently well with rose fillingsdmc confectionery also make a white chocolate called passionfruit charlottes  they may look like a particularly attractive box of truffles but their inside are  as the name suggests  a passion fruit flavour but made as a jelly instead of the usual chocolate paste or cream filling  it may initially seem unusual until you taste it having such a tangy and strong fruit flavour in a jelly seems to result in a much fresher taste than smothering it in cloying butter and cocoaonce again as with the mini pecs turkish delights the charlottes smell so sweet and delicious the second the seethrough cover is removed  also the white chocolate seems a more appropriate partner than milk or dark chocolate i never thought id ever be writing such a sentence as it complements the fruit filling as fresh cream or icecream wouldat the moment these delicacies are sold at selected wineries and gourmet chocolate stores and cafes but interest is increasing  if youre nice barbara barbara at dmcconfectionerycomau might tell you where you can find them  trust me theyre worth itthey look delicious im a turkish delight fan so these are right up my alleyhopefully theyre available at chocolates on parade ill check next time im in there
after my recent spate of oddball reviews i thought id pop in something a little more normal  a lindt bar i bought in spain a little while agolike the rest of the range its cocoa content is only  but the chocolate is pleasantly dark in colour as you can see its also shot through with flaked almonds an addition which seemed a little superfluous until i got down to the business of tasting itnow as collective chocablogger experience has shown time and again lindt products consistently deliver and this is no exception intense is definitely a word id use to describe the aroma of the chocolate its dark and deep with a slight citrus overtone and tons of cocoai was a little surprised by the lack of pear smells and for a minute i wondered if this was going to be a bit of a wimpy bar when it came to the fruit element but of course its lindt and of course it has pear flavour pop a square in your mouth and bite down and the moment it starts to break down your taste buds are flooded with an absolutely stunning combination of chocolate and pear the chocolate is not perhaps as deep and dark as the aroma might suggest but the two flavours are blended superbly well the addition of flaked roasted almonds adds an unexpected crunchy counterpoint to the chocolate and pear rounding off the whole taste experience rather well its unusual its delicious and it ought to be available everywhere not just on the continenti suppose the only way to conclude is to repeat the oftheard chocablog why oh why arent we allowed more of this yummy stuff in the uk plea come on lindt we brits love our chocolate too send us your entire range of products and sweep away the bland and the boring for once and for allgreatand the same goes for us aussies  matt mark thomas can we get this flavour and cherrychilli and  and whatever other tantalising delicacies are available only in europe here in the land down underpretty please with a cherry on topi just bought this choc in coles act tuggeranong to be precise now very much looking forward to eating it    i just tried this in canada and i must say i have to agree with the description of absolutely stunning for the flavour of this bar  yumhmm maybe the manufacturing of the european bar is different but having tasted it it smelt nothing like pear and tasted nothing like it either the pieces were like soft crystallised very sugary indiscernible fruit dont get me wrong it tasted great just not what i was anticipating the almond was the highlight for me not the intense pear
sadly for isis the thin white cardboard box doesnt stand out on the top of the supermarket shelf which is probably why ive seen them slashed to half price at coles and kmart  they just dont look luxurious enough  as with global economics im no marketing expert but i suspect that darker glossier colours and thicker packaging is likely to evoke a classier product than this uninspiring one  however you cant judge a choc by its wrapping so i soldiered onand boy am i glad i did  these are lovely  two layers with eight chocolates in each and i struggled to keep love chunks and sapphire away from them until i had my official tasting  none of us are white chocolate fanatics but the two types here  white shells milk chocolate bottoms and a fluffy orange liqueur filling and a cappuccinolike coffee centre were indeed luxurious and well craftedthe dark chocolates made up three out of the eight kinds and at  minimum cocoa solids i was impressed  plus they smelled divine  one of the finest things in life is when you open a box of chocolates and the delightful smell of good quality dark chocolate assails you  once again these were lovely lovely lovely  the royal achieved my dream of pairing great dark chocolate with top notch flowing caramel the napoli cherry in kirsch was perfectly sweet and bitey and  according to love chunks and sapphire who ate both of them  the cuba with a rum and bitter hazelnut cream centre  had them both rolling their eyes and gesturing wildly in what i interpreted as ecstasymiddle of the chocorange and middling in terms of taste the three milk chocolates were not up to the standards set by the whites and the darks in this box  all of them had hazelnut of some kindchopped praline or cream which was merely ok  not exciting not different and not done in any way that makes them stand out as being above the norm  perhaps isis should just have one hazelnut centre and do something different with the other two milk chocolate shells and three duds out of eight lets the side down somewhatdespite that im off to see if there are any more left at half pricekath you are right these are delish my daughters dont like them though which is another plus the white chocolates are great i am also not a fan of white chocolate really why bother but these combine the supersweet taste of the white chocolate with that great dark centre i even liked the liquer one covered in the red foil all in all a great buy
when i read the contents list i half wondered whether the fits element referred to the caffeine and guarana mixture that lay beneath the chocolatey exterior surely they couldnt be that stimulatingi found them quite tasty myself and the fact theyre so small makes it all to easy to monster up half a tin just by sitting at ones keyboard composing a reviewexcuse me i think i need to go and do something vigorousa  chocolate shell will at least ensure huge sales in china and i wonder if that was deliberateuhhwhat decided to slip some engrish into the review yourself there simon or have i missed something herehahaha that name is hilarious even being german this doesnt make any sense at all or maybe ive been away for too long and missed out on some trendthese are my all time favorite chocolate candiesive discovered them a year ago and got addictedif anyone knows where i could order them online please let me know
in this case the chocolate comes in a bright pink red and gold box with a design that looks a little like an oriental rug but prestat is very very british it says so several times on the boxthe chocolate inside is equally pretty its dark not too shiny and proudly proclaims its name in the middle unfortunately those chunks arent very deeply defined so its difficult to snap off a small chunk without taking half the bar so i guess that means ill have to eat half the bar its a hard lifethe box describes it as intensely dark and that comes across in both the aroma and the taste in fact the chocolate tastes significantly darker than the  cocoa solids it claims to be its actually a little too strong for my liking  a little too bitter but without the range of flavours of better chocolates i kept waiting for the sweetness or fruitiness to kick in but it never came instead i was just left with that slightly bitter aftertaste that put me off dark chocolate as a childthis is obviously a well made quality bar and the packaging helpfully informs me that prestat is enjoyed by royalty and nobility stars of the screen and stage and even by cardinals bishops abbots and nuns for over  years a statement which i find a little bizarre quite apart from the fact that they seem to have difficulty constructing a sentence without inserting a comma between every other word why is this relevant perhaps the next version of the packaging will just have a big sticker saying as recommended by god on the frontperhaps the next version of the packaging will just have a big sticker saying as recommended by god on the frontyou owe me a mouthful of diet coke and a new keyboardi died and went to chocablog heaven glad to have found your sitegreat review  i tried some prestat milk chocolate with salted almonds i think some time ago and like you i thought the packaging was rather pretentious  nonetheless i really enjoyed it  too expensive for a regular treat but i liked the salt and chocolate combination more than i thought i wouldi couldnt find a review for this one on your site though im new here and mightve missed it  any chance you might be trying it in futurelove the blog  
my eye caught this box at world market which sells well world furniture trinkets and foodtheyve also turned out to be one of the best places to buy chocolate in arizona at first i thought this was just a pretty box so i was more than delighted to find that it had chocolate insideat home i found the spring label just how long had it been sitting on the shelf anyway but no matter this san francisco chocolate looks beautiful and boasts quality ingredients including fresh creamthere are twelve truffles wrapped in a light purple the label says that theyre handdecorated and they do stand the appearance test they have a slightly alcholic smell but this is only from the truffle filling theyre smooth rich only slightly sweet and very addictive i was kind enough this time to share and each very different palate was satisfied i almost regretted this moment of kindess my box disappeared instantlyten dollars for a dozen of these beauties plus a handmade box a great value from card box it was meant as something you can give as a present i cant imagine receiving a more welcome package that will appeal to more peoplethey look gorgeous  starting with the box
having said that a new range of guylian dark chocolate squares caught my eye the other daythis tiny little g box offered three different varieties of dark chocolate with varying levels of cocoa solids  this is a clever idea and reflects the current trend that sees chocolate appreciation and tasting becoming as fun prevalent and poncy sometimes lets face it as wine and coffee tastingsolitaire held three squares of each flavour perfect for the lockett family of three all keen to try them in the following stylesthe difference in colour is quite noticeable from  to   interestingly despite using cocoa from asia pretty broad description there covering an area of the planet that houses at least three billion people africa a rather large continent and aztec gold presumably south america the chocolates themselves are made in belgium  ohdespite belgium perhaps not having the reputation for being the most fun and vibrant place on earth theyve made a cracker of a name for themselves in the chocolate world and these three unassuming little squares are no exceptionwe started with the asian dark  and were impressed with the sweet silky texture  the bitterness of the cocoa emerges with a faint hint of white pepper flavour producing a very satisfyingly smooth and lingering taste  this would make a lovely block of dark all on its own  i certainly craved more than the g serving i hadthe aztec gold entering the fray at  cocoa solids was less sweet with a noticeably stronger and bitter flavour than the asian dark but not so that it was overpowering  still pleasantly smooth with a creamy mouth feel to it african ebony  was of course the most bitter in flavour and celebrated it unlike some dark chocolate at this level whittakers immediately springs to mind it wasnt gritty but remained sleek to the tongue and taste buds  just perfect for late nights on the couchguylian have come up with a real winner in my book  they have also released much larger boxes of these trios which ill certainly be buying again  it is a clever and attractive way to encourage resisters to the dark side to move towards the heaven that is  percent and beyond   i also love pralin but i know many pralin chocolates that are much much better than the guylian sea shells theyre almost tasteless and even the texture isnt as nice as pralin should be but im belgian so maybe im just spoilt  i might try these dark chocolates though i just hope theyre indeed better than the sea shellsthey use to sell these solitaire chocolates at fred meyer i tried them once and they were awesome they dont sell them any more though its so disappointing 
the rhubarb content is delivered in much the same way as the lemon was in the other trapa bar  as crystals this does of course mean that theres an amount of sugar there too but happily it didnt really stop the naturally tart rhubarb flavour coming through and cutting the sweetness of the white chocolate  the aloe vera was i must say something of a lost cause okay its there and according to some people it will probably have done me some good but in terms of adding to the taste of this product i am unable to tell you anything  is never going to filter through something as intensely flavoured as rhubarbits a combination that works really well with the rhubarb doing a sterling job of reducing the sweetness of the chocolate the chocolate itself is a pretty decent swiss blend with  milk solids and a creamy soft mouthfeelim off to spain again in a month or so and ill be keeping an eye out for more trapa bars based on current experience they seem to be producing some fairly worthwhile midpriced chocolate bars id recommend white chocolate and rhubarb to anyone who dislikes overly sweet white chocolate productsi have about as much fondness for rhubarb as my rearend does for diarrhoea so  for the first time ever i think  ill leave this one all to youi quite like rhubarb but im no fan of white chocolate however ill give it a try if i find it anywheremy house is never without the made from earth aloe vera skin treatment and ive tried many kinds most of what has been available has been in gel form  which is full of chemicals to make it gellike carcinogenic preservatives are used as well as artificial colors scents etc all i want is  aloe vera since finding the made from earth aloe vera including the aloe  jojoba for the body i keep one bottle on the frig door at all times for a more immediate cooling soothing effect one bottle is in the bathroom medicine cabinet and one in the bedroom its not a gel  its a real aloe vera cream that is potent

and these certainly look tempting large whole straweberries covered in a creamy looking white chocolatestrangely they have a slightly sticky  tacky feel to them that could just be my bag but i suspect its down to the shellac listed as a glazing agent on the ingredients call me old fashioned but id rather my chocs werent coated in insect secretions and im not convinced it was necessary to use it here the cynic in me thinks its probably just there to help extend the shelf life of the product the white chocolate itself is also just a little too sweet for my liking its not the worst ive tasted but it doesnt need to be this sweet the deliciously cardboardy freeze dried strawberries are already very sweet and the coating takes them to a level approaching sicklinessid love to see a version of these with a high quality milk or dark chocolate and without the glazing agent unfortunately as tempting as they look i dont think ill be buying them againthat is too bad they looked so good when i saw the picture i can totally relate to the sweetness factor thoughthey look extremely deliciousinsect secretionsmaybe tesco should be forced to put that on their packagingwhy wait a little liquid nitrogen a bar of lindt    should be peasyi think youd be more likely to  have access to liquid nitrogen  and lindt  than me go for it shellac isnt that what they used to make the first records from at least in germany the material for them used to be called schellack and im strongly assuming its the same stuff eeeksylke yes its the same stuff its commonly used as a food additive but i guess most people dont know what it ishttpenwikipediaorgwikishellacshellac is commonly used in the food industry to add glosssheen on chocolate and confectionary products they do look shinyand to stop sticky items from sticking together reference essential guide to food additives v emmerton leaterhead food international can any one plz tell me where can i get this product and the official website producing this productbt i need an id and a password to see it and i am frm india how do i go abt itwell unfortunately the chances of being able to get them in india are probably zero tesco is a british supermarket and these are their own brandwell i just wana check them out i can have it orderd it frm my friends in nottingham bt i need a way or a link to find tht product on the website the tesco belgian white chocolate strwberrybtw for how many days does it remain fresh and whts the price and in wht packaing its availablesandip i really would just recommend that your friends in nottingham sign up for tescocom on your behalf and send you a linkand or product info via email if you cannot sign in yourself sortedthey sell a much better premium version of this in japan  they are sold boxed and are delicious  i stumbled on this page in my occasional and always fruitless internet hunt for them  please post a link to this page if you know where to get themjust received a box direct from japan from a recent visit from a friend absolutely delicious looking to purchase the same somewhere in chicago area ant ideas
this bag is one of those decentlooking products although im still trying to find out how two almost identical chocolates can be an assortment there are ten individually wrapped squares of eachto my surprise the chocolates themselves were also decentlooking their smooth faces awakened a little hope of getting out of the webs tangles the dark chocolate with cacao nibs was both too sweet and too bitter along with that wonderful hersheys plastic smoothness after the chocolate melts which it does much too quickly youre left with crunchy blueberry tasting nibs they were the better part of the experience the dark chocolate is much the same only the lack of nibs makes it sweeter yet this isnt a bad thing as theres also a chance for more flavor to come out so i actually enjoyed this one moretheyre okay chocolates but i wouldnt go so far as to call them premium their pleasantness is more like what you get from eating an ice cream sundae nice enough but it ends therehersheys is only good for smores i dont like these chocolates at all just not worth the calories or effort in unwrapping and chewing themthey are greatyeah i was really surprised when i went to uruguay and saw a few hersheys  bars of different content around they were meh  they werent crappy but they werent lindt and at a similar price per  grams id choose lindtjo ann no i havent tried xocai yet but i think ive seen it before ill have to give it a tryi think the toll house cookie recipe from betty crocker cokboook is better than the ones on the bag of either nestles or hershey  the cookies have more flour so they spread less and are chewier and softerbarb
not long ago i was pleasantly surprised to be greeted at the door by a courier carrying a box from italy yes finally simon from stainer came good among the numerous beautifully packaged bars and there are plenty i found this quartet of g alcoholic bars three of the four are  milk chocolate and all are blended with one sort of booze or anotherthe champagne bar was the first one i tried and it smelled surprisingly sweet rather like a champagne sorbet the chocolate flavours are excellent borderline dark tastes of vanilla and cocoa slightly woody and very well balanced the mouthfeel is a little grainy at times i suspect the flavourings or sugar but overall a very pleasant light flavoured bar which does indeed deliver the taste of champagnethe irish coffee bar certainly lets you know what to expect it has an incredibly strong coffeealcohol aroma and as soon as you pop a square into your mouth your tastebuds are hit with the two flavours lots of strong whiskey taste sitting above a reasonable coffee undertone again slightly grainy and a little too sweet for my palate but a pretty good facsimile of the drink its trying to emulatemy third bar was the mulled wine or vin brule bar its flavoured with cinammon cloves and vanilla as well as the wine tastes and its the cloves that hit the nose first not being a great fan of the clove i wasnt expecting to like this one much and as i popped the square into my mouth i could taste little else at first however resisting the urge to give up ie spit the blighter out i bit into the chocolate and allowed it to start melting at which point the citrus of the lemon flavour came and saved me from more clove nastiness im not sure where the wine was in all of this  my friends the cloves were definitely out in front all the waythe final bar of the quartet was also the only dark chocolate bar a  cocoa chocolate blended with rum i was a little surprised to find that the chocolate didnt reek of rum like the irish coffee one had but instead i could smell quite complex woody leathery  notes in the cocoa  of course once it was in my mouth the rum flavours came out to play adding a sharpness and an almost citrus tang to the overall taste if anything the texture of this bar was grainier than the previous three and the rum flavours all but obliterated the chocolate tastes until the last morsels were melting away a little over the top for me this onei knew it any excuse for the chocablog team to sunk down some booze  bunch of alchys  these bars sound intresting to say the least i dont think i could quite stomach the rum bar but the irish coffee sounds good to mejimgood
this time he held up a gold box and then made a hasty retreat when my attention was divertedthis sleek gold box just oozes class and sophistication which are qualities i rarely possess let alone when something of this stature is given to mematt is always aware that we true chocaholics need substance over style and the fourteen beauties resting in gold were no exception  plus they were dark chocolate pulling it at a minimum of  cocoa solids  not bad for filled centres in my bookfighting off love chunks and sapphire for more than my fair share i present you withmy fevoriteand i can see why i could easily eat an entire box of any of these chocolates as individual flavourslune means moon in frenchi absolutely adore these lindt chocs have it all the taste the aroma the sophisticated packaging theyre perfect as a gift except you dont really want to give them awayhello  i am zakariya from libya i woner of alemtiaz golden company and i interisting in thise choclet to treading it to my country can you email me about the price and ship informtion and thank you  why is it that with a box of chocolatessome are in wrappers
for the first time in my life i woke up with a chocolate hangover  thats right  no alcohol stupid dancing yelling or shouting the entire pub a round of drinks was involved  just this box of lindt petits dessertsso here in no particular order of preference they areill be honest i ate far more than just seven  hence the hangover  deserved but unlike overindulging in red wine brandy or mango schnapps i still wanted to eat chocolate again the next daythey sound heavenlyoh belive me they are when you bite the one of name merengue it feels like your biting a little piece of a cloud with delicate flavorthe tiramisu and those little tarts look pretty delicious actually ya know what they all do the petit desserts bars are amazing so its safe to assume that these would be toothe creme brulee and the macaroon are just delicious i could easily live on them for a few dayswow they sound really nice id want to try the meringue it sounds interesting terrys post do they really sell them in bars or is that only in cafes like the city concept storei just bought these at the store and once i got into the car i broke into the box i sat there in pure bliss for a few minutes and then came back to reality sadly i really enjoyed the lemon tart which surprised me because usually i dont like those kind of things my least favorite was the brownie but it was still good however i did not get a chocolate log in my box what was that like
chocolate i think one of the amazing things about it is that there are so manh kinds that all fall under that one word like this bar if you ever come across someone who doubts that chocolate is like falling in love please refer them to a  bar theyll be unable to betray such a lovethis bar was different from a  i once had that one had the usual flavor notes of this or that but this one well tasted more holy like chocolate er i mean whollynot to the fainthearted but rather the tenderhearted i recommend this loving chocolate or another  that you find and we all have a little tenderness dont we if its hidden for the moment dont worry ive found that pralus makes me very happyooh our first  bar but not the lasti am now going to search for a  bar here in oz there must be one hiding somewhere surely  anyonekath and all of you looking to find this luxuriant pure chocolate bar  your prayers have been answered  i frequently shop at chocospherecom for dark chocolate  i just purchased one of these bars yesterday  bonnat is considered among the best as is pralus  other names to look out for  amano amedi domori michel cluizel  these are just a few of the best names to start with  bear in mind that you will pay top dollar for chocolate from these manufacturers  some of the prices may astound you bonnat has a bar for close to  but you will absolutely taste every last penny when once you eat it  in general bars from these manufacturers cost between  some cheaper but i am someone who believes that you get what you pay for  i am sure the owner of this beautiful website will agree that chocolate is the one area where this axiom holds perhaps the greatest truth  amedi can get more costly i have seen some of their chocolate bars in the  range but make no mistake  eating dark chocolate is a hobby once you start there is a whole world that opens up  i believe dark chocoholics spend many leisurely hours researching reviewing and investigating new bars to try  if your vices are few consider making chocolate one them  i am certain that other vices if any are as healthy and pure  in the immortal words of dagoba chocolatiers your body can go without food but your soul needs chocolatechocosphere may have a great selection but they dont ship to australiai managed to get a good selection of  bars from chocospere to australia though a shipping redirection service but the quality was very poor and most of the bars were inedible i have no idea if the bars i tried are good or not when freshchocolate does not fly long distances wellthe best way for aussies to get hold of bar or two of pralus le  is to get it shipped overnight from montys chocolates in qld  hes the only importer in australia and its horribly expensivemy wife and i dont eat chocolate with sugar in it and the le  is by far the best pure chocolate bar we have found  we now purchase it from savarinscouk  i find it a bit strange that we can get it shipped to wa cheaper from the uk than from qld but anywaysavarins is fantastic to deal with and has really helped us find the best ways to get the pralus to us in the best condition possible  the bulk price works out to be about the same as chocosphere but the quality is far superiorif only savarins had the other  bars too sigh the michel cluizel noir infini  bars are much easier to find and can be sourced in aus much more easily  its ridiculously expensive for such a small bar and because its not as good as the pralus we dont buy itthe lindt  can also be found in the eastern states but it tastes like trash and i cant bear itshaunyou are so right about the noir infini i had the cluizel  and although i liked it the like had a small selfconscious undercurrent of i am liking this because its a challenge which means that its actually slightly unpleasantthe pralus  on the other hand was a revelationrich creamy and  after it melts on your upper palate  subtly sweet it tastes like you wish a mug of cocoa would taste but rarely doesand without sugar its literally a health foodholy moly you described my experience with the  cocoa pralus bar perfectly it was just simply a heavenly treat to my tastebuds lol soo good 
im not usually a fan of plastic packaging especially on an organic product but i have to admit that seeing the actual chocolate bar through the clear plastic box is probably what sold it to meas you can see once out of the decidedly nonorganic plastic box the bar looks even more tempting a deliciously dark looking chocolate heavily studded with sparkly ginger chunks but the clever bit is underneathyes the chunks are on the bottom clever but of course the important thing is how it tastes and as you might have guessed the overwhelming flavour here is of ginger lots of ginger  a little too much for my liking but those big chunks do add a wonderful texture to that bar and the taste of the rich smooth  dark chocolate still comes through  and is utterly deliciousdefinitely keeping an eye out for that  my mother adores ginger and will even scarf down bags of chocolatecovered pieces unusual for her as she doesnt like sweetsthat looks absolutely wonderful  if they can develop some way of having a window to look at the product that isnt some envirokilling plastic theyll be on to a real winneri love ginger and id be buying that baby if it came down underwowi love chocoloves crystallized ginger in dark chocolate but this just takes it to a whole new levelthat is just awesome saw it on tastespotting and clicked immediately to get to here
i was asked what sort of things i would be interested in and of course i asked for anything unique to slovenia or just strange and unusual and she came through in spades on the unusual front with this  a  dark chocolate bar with cedaryes thats right cedar as in the treethe chocolate is of course the crux of the matter and at  its a good strong blend with deep cocoa notes which expand outwards into a bittersweet vanillachocolatecoffee complex it has an excellent soft mouthfeel and never manages to overpower the added cedar sap blobsgoodwow i think that nearly all of my comments about your rare and unique chocolate finds invariably start with the word wow simonwhat a clever idea though seriously  we add woodsmoke flavours to all kinds of food and even notice stuff like oak in wine so why not the sap to chocolateyoull be delighted to hear that i have a box full of weird n wonderful here so keep those wows handyit is interesting but im not sure id be willing to give it a try i had some pine sap candy a while back and wasnt crazy about it and cedar sap tends to have a even more intense aroma
ive always heard about reeses pieces and knew that they were powerful enough to lure et out of the garden shed but seeing as theyre only available in tiny and expensive little boutique choccy shops and cost a fortune ive avoided trying them until now peanut butter mms on the other hand i have tried and raved about for chocablog before but have also relegated them to the expensive import basket even though i was desperate enough to write to mars confectionery australia to find out why they dont make them here something to do with not being bothered enough to import the machinery required the mean sodsone day however they called out to me from my local specialty chocolate shop that and a pmsled craving for peanut butter saw me at home with both bags ready to try and compareas with the ferrero rocher garden crme filled confections i realised after nearly inhaling half the bag of reeses pieces that they dont contain even a tiny skerrick of chocolate not that i minded they still tasted pretty nice and creamy to me and if i was blindfolded i doubt id be able to tell that there wasnt some chocolate underneath the candy coating and between the peanut butter the ingredients do not make for relaxing reading  sugar partially defatted peanuts partially hydrogenated vegetable oil reduced minerals whey corn syrup and lots of artificial colours and wax and glaze for the sheen hmm i didnt feel quite so chipper after thatand so it was time to drown my disappointment and sorrow with a bag of peanut butter mms before when i considered that reeses pieces tasted as though they had chocolate in them i had not yet had the chance to remind my alltooeagertobepleased taste buds of what the real chocolate and peanut butter combination was likebloody brilliant these little gems make reeces pieces look like the unfortunate combination of defatted partially hydrogenated carnauba waxed and glazed imposters or an explosion of techno monkey poop even mms ingredients were initially more real sounding with chocolate and sugar at numbers one and two per volume but then those creepy sounding partially defatted peanuts popped up again along with the partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil how on earth does one partially defat something is it like confectionery liposuction but some of it is pumped back or the poor little nuts are placed in seaweed wraps and forced to sweat some of their oils outperhaps it is best for this process to remain a mystery but i will continue my lament to mars australia  please cant you make peanut butter mms here and maybe just with normalsounding unadulterated peanuts pleasei havent seen any peanut mms in the uk for a while do they even do them anymoremaybe it is like they make them into peanut butter then let all the oil come to the top and scrape it off so it doesnt come out of the coating you know like you ahve to stir the oil back into the jar of peanut butter all the tim just a thought belsi agree they are delicious however in portugal theyre not available had them when a friend brought them over from the uscheers to chocolatewell said andrew my thoughts exactly look on the bright sideif they sold these in australia you would eventually have to buy bigger pants  i live in the states and you can get a  oz bag here for a couple dollars  when i first discovered these i developed an out of control pb mm eating habiti could down quite a few of those big bags a week  i eventually had to go cold turkeyi havent touched them in over a year  sniff
heres something a little different from the cocoa bean sisters  a selection of chocolate discs in a variety of flavours hand finished and packaged in a funky little cylinderas i mentioned there are seven discs in the box  three milk chocolate three dark chocolate and one white chocolate four of these discs are flavoured the same way as four of the five bars i have already reviewed  milk chocolate with honey and rose and pistachio and dark chocolate with gin  tonic and sea salt which leaves me with the white chocolate and raspberry the dark chocolate with lemon and a milk chocolate disc flavoured with vanillathe raspberry disc as you can see comes sprinkled with fragments of freeze dried raspberry obviously there isnt a huge amount of cocoa flavour there so the additional fruity element was very welcome to this palatethe dark chocolate with lemon oil was very pleasant indeed after trying it on its own i had a few pieces on top of a lemon tart and it went very well good rich cocoa flavours with a lively citrus note which came through at the finishthe vanilla disc was similarly flavoursome producing a good well rounded flavour which complimented the smooth creamy milk chocolate very wellthe packaging and overall look and feel of these discs put me in mind of summer weddings or garden parties theyre bright cheerful looking things which would work extremely well as table extras or favours alternatively they would just add a splash of colour to an outdoor lunch or picnic and the handy little box makes transporting them very easy indeedi liked the look of these almost as much as i enjoyed eating them another fun bold approach to product design which makes cocoa beans merchandise stand out from the crowd  and that can only be a good thing well worth checking out as a gift or for personal indulgencethat is great
as you can see the product itself looks quite appealing  large squares of white chocolate with plenty of flecks of ground pepper it looks good and has a pleasant subtle lemon aroma and that lemon is the first flavour to come through when you bite into a chunk too it tastes natural and fresh without being overpoweringonce it starts to melt the creamy white chocolate flavour comes through as with most white chocolates there isnt much actual chocolateyness here but again its quite a pleasant taste and importantly its not too sweetonly when the white chocolate has all but disappeared do you get the kick of the pepper again its quite subtle but strong enough to let you know its there interesting  seems like a clever way to get chocaphiles into trying white chocolate againim looking forward to seeing the lemon and pepper flavour combination available in dark chocolate in australia  anyone pleasea coworker brought this bar back from spain for me last year i thought it was lovely kind of musky and perhaps even tasted a little cheesy but i ate the whole thinglemon  pepperwow i love your blog there are so many interesting finds awesome flavourwish i could try thisive just been daydreaming about this chocolate and googled it finding this review i love white chocolate anyway and just loved the combination with lemon  its not a combination i would have expected to work but it does im not sure the pepper added anything but it didnt do any harda bit too buttery for me  although i did like the lemon and pepper tones id rather have them wrapped in good quality dark chocolatedo you know if this is still available in sydney would love to try it i enjoy white chocolate i love a bit of heat and i adore citrus also agree that a lemon and pepper combination in dark chocolate would be fantastic anyone found one yet
however the bar itself has an elegant design of similar style twentyfour plain small squares and a larger piece with the pralus signature thickly and smoothly engraved in itthe slight bloom is purely my fault it gets hard to protect chocolate in a seven hour drive through hundred degree weather but it survived fairly wellwhen you break off a piece it has a soft slight crumble which you also get when you chew it but i prefer to let it slowly disssolve releasing the full range of flavors it starts off creamy with a vanilla taste coming quickly in then it becomes more grainy with a caramel taste in fact even the texture reminds me of caramel very interestingmy mouth is watering

my daughter has been hassling me to buy these for ages because she loves the look of ferrero gardens gorgeous pastelandfoil colours which are clearly designed to appeal to the girlie lurking inside in all of us these pretty little things tend to be more prolific during christmas valentines day and mothers day so that also gives you an idea as to who theyre supposed to appeal tohmmm  i wasnt sure whether to be annoyed at the subterfuge or intrigued so i dived in and tried all five flavours  these are almond pistachio forest fruits hazelnut and coconut and all of them were superb with a subtle flavour that was easy to distinguish from each other  all of them were creamy and light with a tiny crunch from the wafer that surrounds the whitechocolatemousselike filling   the main ingredients are sugar vegetable fats vegetable oil and whey powder  no wonder they tasted buttery  it was also interesting to discover that they contain powdered fruits including prickly pear  prickly pear here in australia is a noxious weeddespite the dodgy ingredients complete lack of chocolate and the chickybabe nannainsequins appearance even the man of our house  love chunks  enjoyed them and announced hed be more than proud to be seen eating them in public  we ate the entire ferrero garden box within a sitting happy to find that eighteen divided into three perfectly  sadly there was only two forest fruit crme filled confections in there  and they were my favourite  and four each of the others  perhaps the ingredients such as that essential pesky powdered prickly pear are more expensive  but if this is not the case if simon can get his hands on an entire box devoted to the pistachio flavoured ones why cant we also get a whole box of the forest fruits  please ferrerobutbut thats just not chocolatethe ferrero garden sold here in the states doesnt have those fruity varieties i still prefer the plain old rocher or the new rondnoir to the white onesyes youre right  it isnt chocolate but i honestly thought that it was  like their usual rocher types they even tasted a bit like white chocolate yes i know that white and chocolate shouldnt really be said together either and are clearly packaged to appeal to the chocolate box buyers amongst usor thats my defence anyway  those look wonderful i love the standard ferreros and have never seen these pretties ill have to keep an eye outive been searching for these for months where did you find them love the blog xhere in portugal they sell those in hazelnut pistachio and lemon the lemon ones are fantastic though theyd be even better if they had some chocolate in themi have some lemon here ready to be reviewed and im looking forward to trying themhi i would like to know if the ferrero garden sell in malaysia i was trying to find it but not all chocolate shop have the product please helpi am searching for this in mumbai india where cna i buy thisi dont think that they ell the ferrero garden here in the states i saw it on france and germany on  went i was there for vacation and i try and it was wonderfullllli always buy the standard ferrero chocolatebut yesterday i went to the supermarket in the town and i saw the ferrero garden which ive never seen beforeindeed i was really attracted by the coloured foilgonna buy some soon here in the uk ferrro garden and the chocolate spread is not vegetarian so we cannot try itzakiyyahwhich supermarket did you go to that carries ferrero garden im interested in the green ferrero garden pistachiothanksi discovered these when i was in germany i think they are awsome because they arent chocolate i have several family members who are allergic to chocolate so these are chocolates that they can have i just wish i could buy them in canadai liked all the tastes of ferrero garden besid the almond it has an aftertaste that is not so goodjust had an opportunity to taste this wonderfully crafted pieces of fine chocolate in various garden flavours so far tried only those coconut ones damn tasty and its just simply awesome got it from klia kuala lumpur international airportmalaysian duty not paidit says made in germany rocks  i love this chocolate very muchthis was my first time trying the ferrero i tried the ferrero garden coconut and fell in love i would love to know were i can buy only the coconut onesive tried the website with no luckcheersim living in usa where can i get this i love it so so so muchi tried this several years ago the taste is reallyumunforgettable especially the ones with lemon flavour because it was a present given by my dads business partner i really want to know where can i buy it in europei am living in the netherlands
another offering from tescos pet swiss chocolatier and this time its a milk chocolatethis one is made using ghanaian forastero beans and they give it a fullbodied very smooth cocoa flavour the bitterness level of the beans is relatively low so theyre much more soothing and gentle on the palate and consequently what you get here is a lovely mouthfeel from the high cocoa content a sumptuous creaminess and a lovely smooth finishthis really is what milk chocolate should all be likeas a long time convert to the dark side i do tend to find most milk chocolate can be disappointing in its lack of complexity but im delighted to report that cocopia have come up with a blend which offers all the flavour you could hope forthis is the sort of chocolate youd buy as a treat for the kids and end up making regular trips to tesco to buy for yourself  its that delicious if only all uk manufacturers could offer this quality in their milk chocs id be eating a lot more of the stufffor the price  id have to say that its well worth the money uk readers should make sure they check this one out as soon as they can highly recommendedi wish we had that variety here  its in the middle of winter here in south australia its a freezing cold saturday afternoon and some top quality milk chocolate would go down a treat with my hot coffeedear tescococopia  can you please sell this in adelaide south australia kthnxbyunfortunately all cocopia products have disappeared from our local tesco  im gutted
holy f everyones favourite sweary chef has a range of fing chocolates but are they any fing good or is gordon ramsay just cashing in on his fing name again lets find outand lets stop the fing swearing too that could get quite irritatingi guess the only thing for it is to give a quick opinion of each of the  chocolates  of each in the box so here goesin summary these are for the most part pretty good the main exception for me is the cappuccino brule which didnt really have any resemblance to any cappuccino or brule ive ever tastedaside from that theyre well made and well thought out theyre not up to the quality of the lindt offering though the soft centres just arent quite soft enough and the flavours arent quite as exciting as they could bebut i know there are many female gordon ramsay fans who would appreciate this simply for the name on the box and while these are pretty decent chocolates a large part of me thinks that anyone who would want to receive a gift branded gordon ramsay does not deserve to receive chocolates in the first placeis there any type of a box of chocolates that have not been made near peanuts i have severe allergies thus am unable to eat my favourites also have an servere allergy to alocohal so any suggestions would be wonderful thank yougail  you should try the lindt excellence  dark range  dark chocolate mousse chili caramel or orange  none of them contain nutsdom sweetie darling sweetie  theres a few typos in this here article and my normallyrepressed high school english teacher is emerging  or was it the ashfilled cappuccino bruleeyoure a brave brave man dom and its another big credit to you that chocablog reviewers are honest  even if they risk getting an angry gordon fking ramsay on their front doorstep ready to kick their ases for not liking some of the chocs  i think gordon is highly overrated  i will stick to lindt myself  their reputation speaks for themselves and they dont need to fing throw in any blinding swear words or bully you into trying them out  gordon is a legend in his own mindi love assorted chocolates that have a lot of white chocolates in them growing up id try to pick one of the white chocolates from the box why were there always only two or else id be left trying to find a milk one without nuts inside it sigh someone needs to make a box thats all white chocolate just different fillingshaha what great marketing especially putting ramsays name upfrontbland bland bland try leonidas for chocs that pack a flavour punchthanksdaniel i cant find anywhere online that sells them at all but youre probably better off going for something like a box of lindt chocs anywaypersonally  i love em hope santa brings me a box this yeari bought some of these for my wife last year on valentines day we both thought they were terrible bland not very chocolatey and just pretty tasteless  a real disappointment  will stick to hotel chocolat this year
its divided into eighteen squares each with the chocolatier name and cluizels signature initially its an earthy chocolate then it moves on to a slight fruitiness and finishes on a sweet notethe texture is as equally interesting as the taste at first i thought it was a little hard but then its amazing how gently it melts away not extravagantly but in a more subtle way its very smooth yet clean absolutely beautifuli think this is a new favorite hereit looks so elegant am definitely intrigued by the fruitiness you said it hasim mostly intrigued by how big the chunks arethat does look good
this bar has been asking to be reviewed ever since i bought it homewhy do i say that well mainly because it has such a powerful smell that i have been made aware of it every time i open the chocovaultregular chocablog fans will probably know me as the bloke who travels a lot and finds weird things to review well this bar fits that bill perfectly you probably know absinthe as that evil greenblue alcohol that used to send people insane and which you tend to avoid if you have any common sense at all its a ferociously strong spirit with a bitter taste so bitter that the usual method of consumption involves adding a large amount of sugar and for that reason i was fascinated to see just how venchi were going to pull off an absinthe chocolate blendthe chocolate used here is a  dark extra bitter so i was beginning to wonder just how much of a screwface i was going to pull opening the wrapper and revealing the surface of the chocolate released yet more pungent anise aroma which wiped out any hint of cocoa from the bar one thing was certain  this was going to be a unique taste experiencethe bar breaks into very small squares its only g anyway but each horizontal line divides into three so the actual dose is pretty small and this is probably a good thing the first square was all about the absinthe tart aniseed notes overpowered any of the delicate chocolate flavours that may have been there leaving only the texture of smooth dark chocolate for my tongue to work with the finish is also alcoholic in nature its more like eating an aniseed ball than a bar of good quality high cocoa content chocolate a second square merely reinforced the idea that there was no way i was ever going to be able to discern the more subtle aspects of the chocolate all that happened was that i ended up with more of the powerful aniseed aftertaste obliterating my palate and forcing me to call a halt to any further tasting exercises for a whileso there you go  proof that you cant just throw any old flavours into a bar of chocolate and get away with it there are some things in this world that are never going to be a good match for the cocoa bean and if you ask me absinthe is one of themwow  where did you get it from where was it made absinthe is illegal in most countries these days isnt itenough questions  your article also left me with a gorgeous mental picture of you staggering around groping blindly trying to cope with the taste  well done for taking a hit for us chocaphiles  i find it delightful but then again i have drunk absinthe for many years  a little bit of the chocolate goes a long way let it melt in your mouth it reveals itself nicelyi have found this to be a excellent blendi think its well worth a taste if you like exotic chocolate blends 
the original mars isnt too bad in terms of fat content  g per g bar at least when compared to other chocolate bars that tend to be lighter  on average about g and have more around g of fat   believe me ive looked   i was also reminded of how sicklysweet mars bars are and how filling they can be  i was also reminded of seeing my nineteen year old brother trying to eat one within minutes of leaving the dentist after receiving two fillings  with an entirely numb right hand side of his face the caramel and chocolate spilling down his neck in a sticky drool was not a nice advertisement  after eating one nearly twenty years later though theyre good sturdy and value for money  just make sure you have a cup of tea on hand to ease your thirst from the sugar hitthe mars lite proudly proclaims itself as being  less fat  underneath this in much smaller type it states than the average of leading bar brands  oh right  on the plus side they taste just as good as the original which is a relief  however this is only because instead of the bar being g it is merely g so already the fat content has been cut by a quarter  annoyingly it is still priced the same as the g bar thus increasing mars confectionerys profit margin by  sneaky mars sneakymy advice is to buy the g classic cut it in half and give one of the sections to a friend  there you have it  only five grams of fat but still the same dependable mars bar taste  lower in fat and cheaper toothe mars rocks looks delicious like on its way to becoming a lion
there are a total of five bars in their swiss range and this one contains black pepper and lemon granules made from lemon juice sugar and water in a  cocoa dark chocolate basethe chocolate is a nice dark colour and smells very citrus when you pop a square into your mouth you get all of the flavours right away theres no dominant flavour or crescendo of tastes as soon as the chocolate starts to melt you become aware of the sweet little lemony bits  and they are quite sweet the underlying black pepper notes never go away though and serve well to temper some of that sweetnessit isnt really until the finish that the actual flavour of the chocolate manages to come through its quite dark with a good level of bittersweetness which is probably a good thing given the sweetness of the lemon granules i tried my usual trick of keeping the granules in my mouth after the chocolate had gone but found it way to sweet or my palate that wayanother one to keep an eye out for if youre in spaincomments are closed
i have to admit my heart sank a little when i saw this in the shopneedless to say i added it to my chocolate basket and proceeded to the checkoutas you can see it looks just like a regular toblerone only darker it has the same distinctive shape and flecks of white nougataccording to the label the chocolate is swiss plain chocolate with a minimum of  cocoa solids i always worry when i see the words plain chocolate because more often than not thats exactly what you get  very plain chocolatebut the real problem is that this just isnt doesnt taste like toblerone any morewhat makes a toblerone is that wonderfully creamy milk chocolate with a hint of honey in the chewy nougat bits but here you cant taste anything but the chocolate even if you let the chocolate melt away in your mouth so youre left with only the nougat the flavour is only barely discernible the dark chocolate simply overwhelms everything that makes a toberlonedisagree  toblerone darks been around in switzerland for at least the past forty years and its my favourite version  much less sweet than the milk versionhave you tried toblerone white  thats great too  i didnt realise it was kraft now still its much nicer than their cheese slices i have one of these sat in my chococupboard i quite liked it but found that the nougaty bit stood out a bit too much for me i rather liked the dark chocolate though each to his own ehthats interesting maybe mine was duff but i could barely taste the nougat at allthis question is a bit off topic but i cant seem to find out the anwser i bought a lion from poland in a little shop in bath and its called lion biaty what is biaty lol palso i got a called  bit and was wondering what that was loli agree  i tried this last month and found that i could barely taste the nougat or honey  i only really tasted it when i let the chocolate melt away and i was only left with the nougaty bitseach to his own i guess because i lurrve the dark toblerone and the fruitnnut one too and when they turn up on my supermarket shelves which isnt very often i snap them updark choc and nougat wins me over every time maybe for you dom the original is always the best and your heart isnt going to forgive them for introducing new flavoursi love toblerone dark i prefer it over the milk choco or white choco variant dtoblerone dark is probably my favorite chocolate of all  lindt dark chocolate is also very niceto me toblerone dark has almost the perfect balance of chocolate flavor  when you first bit it it is a little too bitter then as you chew it the flecks of sweet honey nougat balance the bitterness perfectly  to me it has a very plesent finish  some of the super high cacao percentage chocolates overpower my taste buds but toblerone has the perfect strength for mei too prefer the original toblerone ive tried this one before and didnt like it that muchive also tried the white choco one which i did like maybe the honey  nougat bits went better with white then dark chocofor my tastebuds at leastis there a plain no nougathoney toblerone chocolate for sale my boyfriend just read something about it in a cookbook just curiousfirst off as others have noted this is hardly a new flavor  i cant speak to how long its been sold in switzerland but here in the states ive been buying them since college at least some  yearssecond not sure why the existence of a flavor you dont like would sabotage your enjoyment of a flavor that you do  i dont like white chocolate if you can call something without cocoa solids chocolate  doesnt mean i wont eat dark chocolate from a manufacturer that makes white chocolatefinally ive always eaten toblerones by sucking off the chocolate and then chewing the nougat  yes i can taste it in the dark chocolate version and its delicious  however you know what would be an amazing new version  double nougat  twice the nougat chunks  wake me up when that version comes outi like the dark toblerone better than the original but its so hard to find sometimeseverywhere i go theyre stocked up on white and milk toblerone and no trace of the dark onei guess it means its not quite that popular among others it is my favorite once i found a store that sells it i just go in and buy all their dark tobleronesi think they get it know as they dont run out as much as they used to i have also found it in a bartells of all places
about a month ago we got an email from a reader in ireland asking if wed heard about nestls complete revamp of its black magic brand in an effort to get with the times and after thorough market research nestl have replaces their oldfashioned box of dark chocolates with bars of chocolatewell ive never really been that fond of black magic but im aware that its been around in the uk since i was a kid and when i happened to see this bar on sale in waitrose i thought id give it a goas you can see from the photos the packaging is rather nice under that thick paper wrapper and foil theres a rather nice looking bar of chocolate as wellunfortunately thats where it starts to go a bit wrong it seems that nestl have updated the branding for modern tastes but havent bothered to update the chocolate at all its the dullest blandest dark chocolate ive ever tastedthe wrapper describes it as mellow but what they really mean is no added interestingness but even the description nestl give it confirms to me that theyre fully aware this bar has no taste at allthe fruit and nut dont add a great deal either very occasionally youll get something stuck in your teeth which relieves the boredom for a few seconds but thats about itit seems to me that this is a blatant attempt to get some of the green  blacks market but the problem is all nestl have done is changed the wrapper and the logo that might fool people the first time they buy it but they wont come back for morei wonder how much theyll make before people wise up raisinets are about it for me and nestlei agree completely i was really disappointed in this bar completely bland and tastelessthing is dom says nestle have replaced their boxes with bars  but im sure ive seen black magic bars before when i was little late s in a vending machine
coeur de caramel au beurre demisel  coeur de nougatnestls coeur de range is not to the best of my knowledge available in the uk so i was interested to see how it would measure up to other more recent and distinctly more posh milk chocolates both of these bars use the same milk chocolate and i was somewhat surprised to find that the cocoa content wasnt listed on the packaging not a great start as far as im concernedits waxy not very creamy unpleasant in the mouth and delivers very little flavourthe caramel part of the bar is perfectly acceptable if a little on the sweet side but im afraid nestl havent built a reputation for making caramel and this bar is not going to do them any favours in the face of such huge competition these dayshaving disliked the first bar so much i have to admit that the prospect of couer de nougat didnt thrill me same cheap nasty milk chocolate but with a thin layer of chewy nougat to repel the chocolate and boy was it chewy my initial attempt to break the bar along the lines given proved fruitless at one point i considered resorting to a pair of scissors to divide this one up properly again the filling is perfectly acceptable but very sweet and the chocolate is completely forgettablehow on earth nestl think they can get away with punting this sort of dreadful old rubbish out when all over the world people are waking up to the huge range of complex flavours and taste possibilities that good quality chocolate offers is beyond me i dont remember exactly how much i paid for these bars but i know it was too muchthe milk chocolate used in these bars epitomises everything thats wrong with mass produced industrial chocolate putting it into a welldesigned box which hints at a luxurious taste experience just wont cut it any more nestl people im sure you have the wherewithall to produce some half decent or even excellent chocolates so why have you even bothered to begin inflicting this sort of nonsense on your customersavoidthats awful simon even the packaging and logo looks cheap and nasty  i wonder why nestle bothers when they have better lines of chocolate available out there
i suppose if you were to ask my friends and acquaintances to name one thing about me many of them would tell you that i do quite like my food i enjoy cooking almost as much as i enjoy eating and consequently im always keen to try new flavoursof course there are other ingredients as well  tomatoes naturally spices of course and haricot beans for texture but believe it or not the chocolate flavour does actually come through as a finishing note its very subtle a little bittersweet but definitely there the initial tastes are spicy tomato with chipotle and jalapeno making a fiery mixture then as the fire dies away the dark chocolate comes through as an interesting if somewhat bizarre at first finishing notethe label informs me that this is another limited edition so i guess i may have to attempt my own mole sauce at some point after all but for now im enjoying this dip a lot give it a go if you like your chocolate spicythis is so not mole im gasping at the audacity of tescos mole is lovely and this dip may be lovely too but gah you cant simply take savoury food add chocolate and call it molewanders off mutteringum sainsburys not tescos obviously bah i was upsetwikipedia says mole is a generic term used for many different sauces i wouldnt know as i never eat anything named after burrowing mammalsin english it often refers to a specific sauce which is known in spanish by the more specific name mole poblanoregardless id love to see a version of mole in mexico that includes those ingredients there are variants  my argument is simply that this isnt one of themsylvia maybe im misunderstanding you but is your argument that chocolate is not used in mole because here in the southwest us arizona to be exact where we live on mexican food chocolate is a very common ingredient  definitely in mole poblano and mole negrasorry just wanted to make one more comment on mole  one of the coolest things about it is that it is so versatile and so individual everyone has their own take on it so there really is no incorrect way to make it  only individual interpretations i have a mexican friend here in tucson who swears by adding peanut butter to his mole and it is absolutely delicious i know a lot of people who would scoff at his recipe but its mole nonetheless  just his own versionjewel yes you are misunderstanding mechocolate is used in moleadding chocolate to a sauce does not magically turn it into a moleim not saying mole cant be modified but do you really feel that a chunky tomato and haricot bean dip with chocolate is a mole it strikes me as a dip that happens to include chocolate 
for the first time in our thirteen year marriage my darling husband love chunks actually got up from watching a live broadcast game of australian rules football featuring his team the adelaide crows to tell me that the chocolate id just given him to taste was  in his words the best ever  wow  lovely lustrous lyrical lindt have finally answered my prayers for a hopedfor combination of good quality dark chocolate and caramel  im heartily sick of overlysweet milk chocolate and what passes for caramel and this beautyofablock delivered salvation in spades  as with the orange flavour the intensity of the dark just sings to the sweet lightness of the caramel with both flavours mingling together and still producing two separate taste sensations on the tongue the only complaint i have is that ten large squares divided into a household of three chocolatelovers eager to get their fair share is rather difficult we each took our turn to have four squares instead of threethe third and final lindt creation  block of the terrific trio pure chocolate looked exactly the same as the other two but without the additional layer  in this case appearances were deceiving because it didnt need anything else and allowed the character and quality of the chocolate itself to shine through and im glad it was the last of the three we triedpure chocolate was truly delectable  the outside is nice and thickly coated good enough to chomp or suck slowly  then the inside introduces itself to the palate as a vastly superior version of whipped mousse  this is also dark chocolate but a substance so light that it cruelly captivates tantalises and then disappears to leave the eater to enjoy the last few notes of the still dissolving hard chocolatethe filling is not as buttery as the inside of their lindor balls but fluffier than their chocolate tart variety  for a few crazy moments i wished i was antsized so that i could bellyflop into the filling with my mouth open  brilliant topclass stuff  well done lindt  i intend to have my will state that my ashes are to be scattered over your premisesya these are good generally i think most of the lindt choco bars for mass market options are tasty and they try to be creative with the flavours at least here in france i love the caramel one from the above lindt creation collectionits addictive mmmmmomg ive wanted some lindt chocolate with carmel for the longestt timee loll i didnt like the one with the crunchy shell i thought it was gross but that looks yummyhaving become seriously hooked on lindt creation and intense orange also enjoyed as a football aperitif we find it has disappeared from the woolworths shelves we are utterly bereft and disgusted with woolworths where has it gone and why are others finding it gone or is it just in townsville that it has disappeared nothing matches itdearest bereftyou are right it has gone  sadly according to my buddies at lindt it just wasnt selling  it was  grams compared to their slimmer g excellence range and was therefore always pricier and very rarely on sale  so essentially its not woolworths fault but the aussie  buyers who dont know a quality product when they see one  sighim actually going to write a series of articles on gone but not forgotten chocolates in australia and these darlings were going to be on themin egyptits hot most of the yearits no good keeping chocolates out of the refrgdator  but the dark ones are greatthay dosent milt like the ones with milkbut i didnt try darkcarameli can immagen how it  tastit tast just like a sweet dream
on the surface this bar looks quite similar to the ritter sport bar at g its the same weight although a different shape and even the packaging looks similar the chocolate in this bar is slightly darker at  as opposed to the ritters oh and its also significantly shinierits not completely clear from the photo but the finish on this bar is wonderful its the glossiest looking chocolate ive seen in a long time in fact i could probably use it as a mirror if it wasnt for the fact that i just feel guilty looking at myself in chocolate oh wellthe texture of the marzipan in this bar is very similar to that of the ritter sport bar its drier and crumblier than im used to the taste is quite pleasant but im not entirely convinced by the texture its just a little too grainy and dry for my liking id quite like to try a smoother more moist filling with the same flavour but i guess this is the german style of marzipanthe chocolate itself is rather nice and complements the marzipan flavour quite well its not too bitter with no nasty aftertaste and feels as smooth and shiny on the tongue as it looksbut once again whether you like this bar or not is going to come down to whether or not you like marzipan not being a huge fan of it myself i dont think id buy this again but if youve never had marzipan chocolate and just want to try one id recommend this above the ritter sport versionyou can find it in your local waitroseyouve never heard of niederegger ive reviewed plenty of their stuff are you not reading my site domyum  i love marzipan but its fairly rare and expensive here in australia but niederegger looks faaabulousgood quality marzipan is pretty hard to find but this looks pretty good despite the grainy texturedefinately a buy im gonna buy soonhaving grown up in germany id say niederegger features in the top third of the market they are well established and well known as to marzipan chocolate i think thats even a fairly new thing in germany i never saw anything like this when i lived there many many years agoi love this bar out of the many ive tried this would be in the top there are a lot of bad ones out there uhg bittersweet chocolate is one of my favs  is hard to find in oz as for marzipan the good quality stuff is golden thus this bar encapsulates the better of both worlds of pure highly elevated yumminess mmmmmmmmmmm shame its rarely on specialcomment commander des chocolat
each of their bars is wrapped in the same tasteful design with black trees behind the name and gold edging only with different colors on the sides ambanja had a bluepurple color reflecting the intensity of the baralthough there were a couple of air bubbles the chocolate had a healthy reddish sheen like the others this bar is divided into twelve rectangles each perfectly sized for tasting i dont consider  cacao very high but ambanja retains a darkness with deep fruity flavors that become sweeter about halfway through finishing in richnessit also maintains e guittards exquisite texture as the chocolate melts in your mouth it ripples off much like a fondue fountain only slower of coursenormally  or  chocolates dont go over very well with me because they have neither the sweetness of milk chocolate nor the range of flavors of dark but this bar passed the testalthough the flavor is much the same throughout it is both sweet and rich an ideal combination i paid three dollars for this  gram bar online its closer to four dollars but it was worth every bithi deannawelcome aboard good workwelcome deanna nice review i can almost taste it
not to be outdone by cadburys revamp of their dark chocolate old gold range nestl too are still proudly flogging their club classic dark chocolate varieties and have introduced a mixed berry flavour to the supermarket shelvesluckily for nestl club the second the wrapper was ripped open my nostrils were assailed with a gorgeous berry smell and the sweet rich scent of dark chocolate  bad mood what bad mood  what was i complaining aboutthe chunks of berry pieces arent very distinguishable from the dark chocolate and could almost be mistaken for sultanas until you bite into a square or two  this was a truly delicious combination with the chewy berry flavour complementing the slowly melting dark chocolate and lingering afterwards to a satisfyingly sweet finishthe proportions looked good at first reading   cocoa solids with the bar comprising  dark chocolate and  berry pieces  the picture on the front of the wrapper shows a strawberry raspberry and blueberry but how were they incorporated  the answer alas wasnt too comforting and here in australia the ingredients must be listed in order of volume firsthmm  now that the block was demolished my bad mood was returning  if i dust off my high school calculator and work out that the berry was only  of the block and the key ingredients of strawberry blueberry and raspberry only comprise one percent of that then nestl has a bit of cheek in putting them on the front wrapper when they only comprise  of the ingredients  ah well it tastes good and i know ill be buying eating and enjoying it againhere in the uk theres three key wordings to how something is incorporated into a product  eg strawberry yoghurt could be either branded strawberry yoghurt strawberry flavour or strawberry flavoured  i forgot exactly what they are but either flavour or flavoured has to have actual pieces of strawberry whereas the other needs only to be identifiably tasting ofso so long as it tastes right i guess you can call it whatever you want sort of like crab paste which has crab listed after mackerel spcould be worse could be a chocolate flavour candybar that i am sure many chocolate bars in america should really be calledi was in austrailia recently and discovered nestle plain dark chocolate club and am now wondering if it is available in my area  of redmondwash there is no need to yell on the internet vickyi was in australia recently and became addicted to nestle club mixed berry chocolatecan i buy this in the ukif not why not and are there any plans for this range to be made available in the uk  its amazingly good  die farben sind wunderbar so firsch analoge fotos finde ich jedes mal wieder spannend man weidf nie genau was man letztendlich nach dem enwickeln zu sehen bekommtmarch      pm
as you can see these handmade chocs come in a rather attractive little box wrapped in a ribbon and finished with a tag that tells potential buyers exactly what to expectim very happy to say that these do not disappoint on any front the milk chocolate is a healthy  and the moment you pop one into your mouth you know that the fig inside has indeed been steeped in a healthy amount of dark rum the alcoholic taste runs deep in these but it never takes away from the creaminess of the milk chocolate and when you start to sink your teeth into the baby fig and they are indeed very small succulent little things the three flavours unite in mouthwatering harmony i had an actual homer simpson moment as i tasted my first oneskelligs chocolate seem to look after the posh side of the operation as evidenced by their packaging and products they sent along some other rather lovely looking samples of which more soon and the choice of fig and rum is an inspired one definitely for adult palates and definitely a lovely looking gift  for someone else or just as a treat  these are truly delicious little chocs my first taste only left me wanting more and im trying to resist the temptation to finish off the box too quickly preferring to eke these out by restricting myself to a couple at a timecomments are closed
uncle dom chocablog creator and master of all things containing cocoa sent me on a mission  thats right when the dom makes you an offer you cant refuse  kathy from australia yes theres more of us alerted dom to cadbury old gold liqueur flavoured selection eloquently advising us that its not too bad with that glowing recommendation i eagerly set out to find somethis flavour  or four flavours  forms part of cadburys relaunched old gold brand line and is their first venture into the grown up world of liqueur since their old jamaica rumnraisin classic  the four large roundish squares per row have one flavour each  coffee irish crme hazelnut and orange  the dark chocolate contains  cocoa solids and yes ethanol is listed one third of the way down the list of ingredients thus qualifying it ever so slightly as liqueur  even better the fat content is a relatively measly g per g normally youre looking at around g fat per g and therefore i refuse to feel deflated by looking at the percentage of sugari have never understood the love of blending hazelnut with chocolate  let alone as a creamy centre but in this block it tasted delicious  not as pungent as the genuine frangelico but a flavour that instantly states itself as hazelnut  for my money however it was the irish crme  this was truly superb  the sweet sensations of cream whiskey and chocolate made number one out of four   again it is not an overpowering flavour so if youre out for a kick slurp the baileys and keep this as your cup of tea chasereven though i would happily like to buy a block of irish crme on its own or see cadbury do a stronger coffee version this is a pretty decent taste quartet that might even tempt your old dad away from his old jamaicano if youre into dark cadbury i salute you  their rebranded old gold dark chocolate range is superb and a big step away from the chavvyness is that a word of dairy milk or dodgy combinations of flavours with dairy milkanother mild coffee chocolate you might like is haighs block of milk coffee chocolate g  very smooth very creamy nice mild taste and top qualityis it anything like their coffee chocolate crunch ohhh i havent been to haighs since my last trip to adelaide  which has been ages quite like that but i cant eat it after eating milk chocolate then its too stronggreat chocolate review i just got myself some old gold chocolate and i cant wait to try it ill save the irish creme for last for sure instead mary and martha  two sisters bureid together  well thats an interesting coincidence isnt iti also wonder why in all the easter morning stories in the gospels mary of bethany is never mentioned as being present after all since their family was so close to jesus and he stayed with them that whole passover week one would expect most of all those sisters or at least mary to participate in the burial rights of their beloved fiend and teacher perhaps this is also a case even early on where mary magdalene was mistakenly conflated with mary of bethany  the woman who likely anointed jesus at messiah before his death and if  just an if here  jesus had been married at all it was likely to mary of bethany
i found this in ms simply food in marylebone station while grabbing a sandwich to eat on the train luckily i managed to refrain from eating it until i got home thats how restrained i ammarks  spencer do quite a wide range of chocolate now and so far my experience of their offerings has been mixed ms may be known for good quality food but the chocs ive had so far have been adequate but not fantastic as you can see this is a single bar of milk chocolate it looks quite boring on the outside with no distinguishing features for some reason im now wondering how the police will identify the body after ive finished with it my mind is obviously brokenthe one feature it does have is a rather pleasant smell that hits you the moment you open the wrapper a traditional old fashioned fudge smell that makes you want to stuff the whole thing into your mouth in one gobut once again restraint got the better of mea quick glance at the ingredients reveals that this really is proper fudge amongst other things this bar contains sweetened condensed milk clotted cream dried whole milk cocoa butter cocoa mass and dried free range egg whiteand it tastes like proper fudge too its very sweet but very very nice fudge is always quite sweet and while i love it i cant eat a lot in one go even this small g bar was a little too much for me and id prefer to have seen it divided into two not that i had anyone to share with and would have ended up eating it all in one go anyway but its the thought that counts rightsoare all your reviewers paid by commissionor are you on retainers to the big chocolate companiesfor this online marketing exerciseand if youre not thenwhere are all the pages of information about the politics of chocolateand the economics of chocolateand where are the reviews of all the fair trade chocolate companies chocolatesdo none of you have children does the thought of slavery not make each morsel of chocolate stick in your throatsjulianim going to give you the benefit of the doubt this once and yes ive seen your comment on my personal blog we are absolutely not paid by choc companies for the reviews we do they are always impartial personal opinions we are currently  people who write bout chocolate because we love chocolate none of us work in the chocolate industry or are connected with chocolate companies we sometimes get sent review samples and when we do we make that clear in our reviews we write about chocolate because its fun so try to stay out of politics as much as possible  there are plenty of fair trade and organic chocs reviewed on chocablog if you cant see them youre not looking very hard yes  of us have children i dont see that thats any of your concern though now youre just being sillyif youd like to have a serious discussion thats fine but if you just want to cause trouble i will have to remove your comments
so sorry matt my lindt longings had finally come true and i imagine that i wouldnt be the first person to react to you in that wayas it happens i had just purchased a box of the stracciatella balls to try and was interested to discover that this cookiesncrme flavour is the most popular type in italy where they were imported down here in time for mothers day  yes aussie chocaphiles they are a limited edition sent here to tantalise us and then disappear quicker than a departing superhero but we never got the chance to thank himessentially the stracciatella are lindts classic white chocolate lindor balls with the outer coating of slightly firmer white chocolate studded with chocolate biscuit pieces  they add a delightfully crunchy texture with my only whinge being that i wish they were also inserted into the creamy middle as well  leave em wanting more i guessluckily matt the magnificent didnt disappoint  lindt have rebranded their whitepackaged blocks and revamped some of them into these rather glamorous dark wrappers that celebrate their  cocoa content  at g per block theyre also a bit bigger than the standard g blocks we find on our store shelves here  i carried this box home with more care than my two university degreesten glossy richsmelling slabsofheaven greeted us  it looked so luxurious and would definitely pass muster as a gift block or dinner party dessert afterthought  the taste also fulfilled what the appearance promised  the slightly bitter but buttery dark chocolate was plentiful in a thickly generous coat allowing a full appreciation of the  cocoa  then theres a hint of the layer of chocolate mousse to melt before finally enjoying the tangy almost marmalade texture of the orangethe chunks in lindt stracciatella chocolates are chopped bits of cocoa nibs not chocolate biscuit its named after an italian egg soup with a similar visual texture not directly intended to be cookies and creamis chocolate chilly lindt goodof course what a great site and informative posts i will add backlink  bookmark this site regards reader
needless to say i ran out and bought a couple of bars straight after the show none of the shops near me seem to have it but i found this milka alpine cream in waitrose in brent crossso whats so special about milka the milk of coursemilka is one of those milk chocolates thats incredibly creamy this particular bar is even creamier because the filling happens to be cream flavoured too you cant see a great deal of difference between the milk chocolate and the filling but the inside of this bar is lighter in texture than the smooth  milk chocolate that surrounds itbut its also particularly sweet and while almost everyone likes milka if you were to eat this g bar in one sitting youd almost certainly make yourself ill the last time i had milka was sat around watching a movie with a group of friends which was perfect everyone got a couple of chunks and nobody left feeling sickthis is an utterly delicious bar its smoothness and creaminess are second to none but if youre the kind of person that eats a g bar of chocolate in one go you might want to avoid this simply because its so sweet milka is made for sharingi love milka excellent reviewbut i have to say i actually consumed a whole g of this last night and i was not ill i wouldnt have said no to some morebut then i hadnt eaten all day so that may have been why i wish we could get more milka varieties over here the selection we have is quite frankly pantsmilka has been making huge inroads in the states i used to only see it at the import shops now they have it at big retailers like target i like the nutty flavor of it like a much milkier giuaduia btw  you have a typo in the title of the post  feel free to delete this note when you fix itthanks for spotting the typo  i seem to be doing that a lot lately either my eyes are failing or my brain is oh i wish we still had milka here i really loved their coffee version  it had a very creamy centre not unlike lindor ballsjust back from menorca two weeks ago brought back with me eight very large bars of milka but sadly its all gone need a cheap flight now as im desperate for more milkaim not so fond of white chocolates but when i eat one i choose milkas white chocolatemilka its just milka  milka factory have the best well lets just say the best tasted chocolate her araund in slovenia milkas no well maybe there are some fans of gorenjka slovenians chocolate but its not as sweet as milka milkas good taste  with lots of chocolate and lots of sugar when you eat milka you just dont think how unhealty it is the taste of it is much stronger and it just beats your mind if i can espress myself that waymilka its just like kinder  their chocolates just so good lots of chocolate and lost of sugar sorry for bad grammer im only   dont use english everydayhere in the balkan countries milka is everywhere its not expensive and its probably one of the best chocolates here i myself dont like lindt its too bitter for me but i can eat the whole g package by myself my favourite is milka mjoy wholenuts but i love all of them equallynotify me iff you can export milka gr euro fob bulgaria and other milka items thank you
while the filling resembles something that would make superman want to curl up and die its actually just sugar but i dont think ive ever seen anything quite like it in a chocolate barthe effect is quite bizarre first its a little like biting into shards of glass then you get the minty hit then the chocolate then the shards start to go chewythe milk chocolate itself is standard nestl fare the flavour is nothing to write home about but its largely overtaken by the mintyness from the real peppermint oil that flavours the bar anyway but i dont think youd be buying this bar for the chocolate anyway youd buy it for the completely unique texturethis is one of those bars that youre either going to love or hate or cut the inside of your mouth to shreds on personally i love it because ive not seen anything else quite like it  and when youve been reviewing chocolate for two years thats quite refreshingwe have them in australia too  the shattered mint mix is always the last thing stuck in your teeth after the chocolates all eatenunlurking to say that there used to be something like this in the uk in the seventies cant remember what it was called mint cracknel perhaps anyway my nana used to crumble it up over vanilla icecream and it was fantastic although it did stick in your teeth a bitkay i vaguely remember something similar im sure it was wonderful on ice cream  crunchie is good for that tooim from south africa  as kids we used to bite off each end of a peppermint crisp and use it as a straw to drink a glass of milk as you drink the shards melt flavouring the milk minty and at the end youre left with a yummy chocolate shellyes we  used to do that tooi was born in south africa now living in england and its still a great treat when my uncle sends me a box of these let me tell you the secret about the nestl peppermint crisp  what you do is you bite both ends and dip it into some cold milk then you suck the milk up through the mint like a straw  its so awesome and the kids will love it  i always did this growing up  and love to share the secret of the crispi live in the states and im passionate about chocolate  i also havent had one in about  yearskay  the peppermint crisp is indeed what we had in the uk in the s as rowntrees or was it mackintoshs mint cracknel the bar is a different shape but the shattery crispy innards are the same i miss that stuff it was my favourite bar as a kid i really wish nestle would reintroduce it here but it seems they dont think the market is therehi there ratbagi read your comment about the mint cracknell i remember them so well as a kid and been trying to find some one of my friends lives in sa and she sent me a link to a different shaped bar but crackenell all the same lol  i was like eyes popping out when i saw it  bring back mint cracknell and we do care  lolyou can buy these nestles peppermint crisp from sanza shop for  per piece bar they dont take long to arrive and are just lovelymmmmi have just found out im highly allergic to sodium benzoate kindly let me know by email whether your  vanilla ice cream has sodim benzoate have to check everything so kept rather busymany thanksfran hall  cape townwe had them when i was growing up in scotlandone of the best south african chocolate bars really miss it austria has great chocolate but  so much back home that was really superi wish these were available in the uk everywhere not just in the very expensive aussie shops  along with nestle golden roughthe best way to have this is to bite each end off and drink milk through iti have just put the recipe for peppermint crisp pudding on my blog  fed it to my family a few weeks ago and they are still groaning with joy as an exsouth african  i am thrilled they now have peppermint crisp in australia  oh golly that looks tasty where do they manufacture this they dont have chocolate like this in the uk where i come frommarks and spencrs also made their own version of mint cracknell and they were yummy tooocado online store sell these nowwish i could get mint cracknel again
it was in spain la coruna to be precise that i chanced upon a range of products from the chocolat factory another company with a lighthearted approach to their work in among the various bars jars and tins was an information sheet which as it turned out included a recipe an explanation of the reasons for a chocolate bouquet and a little historyfirst purchase was a pot of chocolate and pear jam  one of a range  which i just had to pick up simply because i have never seen chocolate jam before chocolate spreads come in many forms but a chocolate and fruit preserve was something piqued my interestthe lovely thing about this jam is that it really is jamlike theres a good portion of pear in the jar and the chocolate content isnt excessively high what you get is a well balanced product which allows you to taste both elements imagine finely chopped pears in a light cocoa based sauce and youre getting pretty close to this jam just like any good conserve the jam has nice little chunks of pear floating around in it and the chocolate element isnt too sweet theyve used candied pear which i presume has meant that there isnt a need for huge amounts of extra sugar its still pretty sweet mindcomments are closed
and so it is with flake luxury  however i must admit that the blame also lies with me  for some reason i must have selected this bar before lunchtimemy second espresso and therefore the ability to focus read and reflect was sorely lacking  i thought that luxury meant that this version was coated in dark chocolate with the original flake inside or vice versano such luck bugger it  it was just the bogstandard flake coated in a thin layer of dairy milk  no luxury there that i could see and im sure it has gotten smaller than the original flake i remember from child and teenagerhood  flake neater maybe but not very catchy from the marketing point of view  no more embarrassing crumbs in your crotch flake is another more honest description but perhaps still not a complete winner from the consumer standpointhow about flake fake  theres nothing new or luxurious about it for complete honesty   nah itll never take offhow odd over here we have flake dipped its not particularly luxurious but appears to be exactly the sameso what were you writing then i can make out child syndrome autumn his father i think addingdetails and then  old gold most intriguingthere is a flake dark thing in nz which is a regular flake dipped in dark chocolate from memory havent had on in a ge they arent nice enough to bother with when you are dairy intolerantthat my friend is the equivalent of a uk dipped flakehttpwwwblightyscomimagescadburyflakedippedgifis the flake luxury  dipped not just a big single finger twirlamanda technically a twirl is made slightly differently but the effect is almost exactly the same as one of these yesgday terry  in addition to living breathing and dreaming all things chocolate i also do other bits of writing  such as a book worklife balance for dummies released in australia in feb this year and hopefully available in the uk next year do booktheatrecdmovie reviews for a local paper appear on radio on a semiregular basis and am trying to get a couple of other book ideas up and running  or you could visit my blog  click on my link here at chocablog or go to blurbfromtheburbsblogspotcom to see what else occupies this tiny mind  
despite the packaging that is clearly designed to appeal to the more feminineleaning chocaholics amongst us my husband love chunks suddenly appeared by my side when i opened the box  we both started with the pinktopped strawberry delice which had a white chocolate centre flavoured with strawberry  it was very light and creamy for us dark side dwellers but we both said mmmmlove chunks declared the macadamia truffle milk chocolate a triumph and i loved the flower pot hazelnut praline  and thats saying something because hazelnut is not one of my favourites  we both enjoyed the cointreau truffle white choc outside milk chocolate in the middle and considered it a winner because neither of us believe that orange and milk chocolate goes as well as it does with dark but this was the best try wed sampled so farthe pink milk chocolate hearts were also delicious  at  cocoa solids they tasted stronger and of much better quality than the insipid fartoosweet stuff you tend to find used as a coating by smaller chocolate manufacturers and is best avoided when served up on its own  but the pice de rsistance for us dark side dwellers was most definitely the dark chocolate coated limon everything seems to sound posher in french centre  such modestlooking squares were the highlight of an already surprisingly good selection  i love love love the combination of lemon and dark chocolate and hope that more chocolate manufacturers follow this trend  the back of the box tells us that the dark chocolate contains  cocoa solids and that the nutrition panel considers two chocolates  or g  the average serving size  not in my house the box also contained a free bookmark photograph of the chocolates  a good sales technique because every time i pick up whatever current book im reading i see the photographs and start thinking about getting my greedy hands on more dark chocolate coated lemonlimon delights and i wouldnt be stopping at a mere twochocolate average serve eithercomments are closed
thats chocolate bananas to youit just goes to prove my theory that you dont need a jet setting lifestyle in order to find exotic chocolate wait long enough and the chocolate will come to you although in this particular case my chocolate seems to have had a slightly tougher journey than simons nougatim fairly sure that when it left austria the chocolate was completely intact just like the picture on the wrapper but aside from the crazy paving effect the bar was in good condition and it looks like the thick sticky filling managed to hold all the chunks of chocolate in placeand that chocolate is rather good its a proper  chocolate not too dark not too sweet as you can see its quite a thin layer so its difficult to judge the quality accurately but it certainly tastes better than your average every day chocolateinside that thin layer is a soft airy frothy and slightly chewy banana flavoured centre its sweet and tangy and tastes artificial  like those banana flavour sweets you find in picknmix  but unlike those this happens to be made with  real bananaim not sure what they other  is but there doesnt appear to be any artificial flavourings or colours here despite tasting liek there might be and i actually quite enjoyed itthe bar weighs only g so unless you eat  at once its unlikely the sweetness will become overly sickly id certainly be tempted to buy it again its definitely not posh but its a fun tangy chocolatey treati did try manners chocolate oranges  remarkably similar in terms of content methinks and very sweet posh kids chocs
something else i managed to find whilst on my travels in europe was a small box of eight ferrero garden pistachio thingummies balls orbs rochers and im not sure these are available in the uk but i havent honestly looked at anything ferrero rocher related in a long timewell now it seems that ferrero have broken out f the drawing room and are now relaxing in the sun lounger outside a light green box shiny green foil and a white petits fours case all reinforce the message that these are differentand they most certainly areas you can see  no chocolate at first i thought white chocolate but i was wrong ought i to end my review right there hang on maybe theres chocolate insidedratinside the crispy outer shell which has been coated in almond chips glued on with some sort of soft cream you will find a nutty tasting creamy goo which holds suspended a single pistachio nutill say one thing for them  theyre easy to eat a couple of bites and your garden is gone the combination of sweetness creamy filling and almond and pistachio flavours make these alarmingly easy to dispose of i found myself almost immediately fancying a second then a third the third one did it for me but those with a sweet tooth should perhaps avoid buying these in quantities greater than eight it could prove expensivea bit of a coincidence there simon because down here in oz we have the ferrero garden box but it also has flavours such as strawberry coconut almond hazelnut and pistacchio  youre right about there not being any real chocolate per se unless white counts but i loved them alli absolutely love the ferrero garden which i discovered whilst waiting for my delayed plane at a spanish airport i have been searching the web to buy them online but no luck any ideas regardsi love ferrero rocher i love pistachio too this will defnitely be heaven for me im not sure if its available though here in the phils i was in paris and found this same box of  i tried relentlessly to return to the same store but since everything in france closes early for dinner i had no luck it has been impossible to track them down here in the states i have been craving them for weeks they are the best in the roche collection by far i am at a loseany ideas ebayjust bought three boxes of the pistachio and two gardens in italy yummy when are these coming to the statesi have not seen these since christmastime  at my local shoprite here in new jersey  they were selling and giving out free samples of these and some other flavors ive never seen before  im assuming it was to promote them and that theyll soon be available in the states least im hoping thats the caseis there in egypt and in vrbru where is possible allivdhhere there is in egypt this product in any areawhere i can find it in indonesiai think you can try to seek it in grand indonesia food court there are many imported chocolate there hope u can find there where can you buy them in the u s
a relative newcomer to the aussie lite chocolate bar scene fling is made by masterfoods marsthe blurb on the packet purrs why have a full on chocolate affair when you can have a fling and describes itself as a delicate crispy centre layered with velvety chocolate cream covered in smooth milk chocolatei was intrigued  and hungry  of course as stated before with regard to mars bar lite the main reason they have less fat is that theres less of them in the packet  the same applies here  a g fling costs the same as a regularsized bar of chocolate g and has the same fat content per g    they describe a serving as one g finger so the fat content appears surprisingly small g  but whos only going to eat one finger instead of two for the sake of all thats good and chocolateythe only trouble is that g is not enough  so i ate two hi kathit dosent look like we are missing to much annyway now theyve run out of that stock and back to twin bars for  centsbahi love them and was not expecting anything goodhi therewas wondering if fling is still sold in australia im in canberra and i cant seem to find them anywhere please helpthankshi therewas wondering if fling is still sold in australia im in canberra and i cant seem to find them anywhere please helpthanks heapsi cant find my chocolate fling is there any way i can get it im in perth or is there a website i can get it from please helpthe mars fling bar was discontinued in  and is no longer available sadly
ive been waiting for this for ages but with the lack of any review samples coming from cadbury i had to wait for it to appear in my local shop which happened at about  this morningso whats this twisted thing then i hear you cry but havent cadbury done that before you askthere are two main differences between that bar and this one the first is the shaperather than being divided into traditional cadbury chunks this bar has a much more distinctive shape obviously designed to look like its been twisted the chocolate has a thick base while the top is made of thinner chocolate and vaguely resembles a screw thread inside that leaves quite a bit of room for that yummy sickly sticky icky creme egg fondant filling because theres no clear definition between the chunks you get more of it than you did in the old dairy milk barso whats the second difference then you askmy you are an inquisitive reader today the second difference isnt in the bar itself but in the branding despite having all the same ingredients as its older sibling theres no trace of the words dairy milk on this bar this might seem like a small thing but its definitely one i welcome ive talked before about how much i hate the dairy milk superbrand because it limits how creative they can be because practically everything the do has to be shoehorned into the same slightly dull brandthis slightly freakish little bar of fun shows that cadbury do still have what it takes to come up with something a little more interesting even though strictly speaking nothing here is newbut i know you still want to know how it tasteswell it tastes like a creme egg so youll either love it or well love ithi domthis has been hotly commented on chocolate mission and the consensus sp seems to be that despite it still retaining the great creme egg taste its a little disappointing considering this is what cadburys deem as their most exciting innovation of the yearit makes for a relatively dull year in cadburys land dont you think jimi disagreethis is a step forward for cadbury not because of whats in it but because of how the bar is branded if it does signal the start of a move away from the dairy milk branding than that will give them much more flexibility in the futureyaynow all we have to do is wait for it to come to oz specifically my little bit of it dmm im getting centipede from that shape but all the same welcome to the rest of the year little onedom  i see what you mean but that still dosent change the fact that its really nothing newas i said if this wasnt the only innovation we could expect from cadbury this year i wouldnt be as disappointedmaybe its not the product im disappointed inmore the prospects of us not getting anything newjimoh yumjust knowing thats out there in the universe makes me happy i love the look of these bars but dont know what they are like or taste like but i love the origial creme eggs what only come at easter time and when i taste this new creme egg twisted bar when i get one at some point i bet id love these even more than the origial creme egg it self i think hahahahttpwwwbebocomcremeeggtwistedi really do like the look of these chocolate bars they probably taste exactley the same but i feel that i would get more pleasure eating an egg instead as there is more filling then the chocolate bar itself i would want a free sample though thanks hiya i would just like to say that i strongly recommend these bars they taste so delicious and would love to share them to all you people but if not then more for me 
as a result of that email i have been the very lucky recipient of a fairly well stocked cardboard box containing a plethora of yummy looking cocoa bean and skelligs products which i now have the job of sampling so that you our dear readers know which ones to buyfirst up is this little wallet of five g bars of assorted milk and dark chocolate each of which has a very distinct flavour as you can see we have three dark sea salt gin  tonic and lime zest  black pepper and two milk rose  pistachio and irish honey  each sleeve has a little background pattern relating to the contents   fish little honeycombs lime leaves roses and bubbles on the gt very subtle and once again a fun fresh look to the packagingthe bars themselves are also a little different instead of being divided conventionally squares rectangles etc the cocoa bean ladies have opted for a rather neat way of reinforcing the brand using the logo and company name to divide each strip of chocolate into both a square and a rectangleso how do they tastewell each bar has a little description of whats in store printed on the backthose look interesting i havent seen many bars with rose in them but i think its a natural comboi have to get to the sheffield shop that sells their stuff i feel a spendingspree coming on ive said it before and will no doubt say it again  you are a lucky lucky bastard  i wonder if theyd like to see them sold in australia hint hint i must say that i am particularly partial to the rose and pistachio too  it brought back similar memories for me of frys turkish delight although its not mentioned above my favourite is the xmas tree chocolatean unusual combination pine anyone  but it really works  is it a special edition as its a shame to only have it at christmas     but then again gin  tonic is fab tootoo many choicesi didnt know there was an xmas tree chocolate  something to request as a special seasonal review piece perhapsthe xmas tree bar is rather special especially since the pine is from my very own pine tree in my back garden 
however when it came to the crunch i was left thinking that actually a little crunch might have been a good ideathe cinnamon flavour was there but in a very subtle way so that the overall taste was once again good old bland white chocolate notes of cinnamon were apparent when i sniffed it and when it first hit my tongue but they never really developed into anything stronger than a hint and that just made the overall experience just a little too soft and creamy for my likingcompared to the mouthwatering loveliness of the elderflower bar this is a very poor second  in my opinion of course someone who loves white chocolate would probably beg to differ but as a lover of the darker tastes i continue to find that white chocolate lacks that certain oomf that only comes with a good dose of cocoa solidshow funny after finding your delightful blog a few weeks ago i decided to have a go at this reviewing business and actually did my own  of the same chocolate lookleysieffer offer quite a range of interesting chocolate creations and on the hunt for a collagues beloved chilli chocolate i also came across this cinnamon variety im a big fan of all things cinnamon and couldnt resist getting to know this variety a little bit better on closer inspection the wondrous creation turns out to be white chocolate  cocoaa letdown better off going dark the actual choccy colour is anything but white by any chance and looks more like a delicious caramel it smells surprisingly faintly of cinnamon to be honest id have expected a stronger smell the flavour is similar its definitely dominated by the white chocolate which is actually quite nice and doesnt overpower you with butter or greasiness the only thing thats really missing for me is the actual selling point  the cinnamon the flavour is very faint and i ended up feeling more confused by reminding myself to taste it than anything elseso if youre after some really good white chocolate with a tiny hint of cinnamon this ones for you but if you crave full flavour maybe look closer to lindts christmas chocolate just out of curiosity but what would you roughly pay for a dolphin gr bar in the uk here in portugal i picked one up yesterday for  not bad rightoh sorry dolfin not dolphin 
inhouse brands owned by supermarket chains dont normally generate an oh this must be really good response for most shoppers this one included  coles supermarkets are the largest chain here in australia and have relaunched their home brand to one that is either a wish or an order youll love coles we hope or is it or elsethey have had a belgian chocolate range out for a while now and ive studiously avoided it until my daughter becoming increasingly wise to the fact that ill buy chocolate if its new to our household kept going on about it every time we went shopping  finally when it was on offer at half price we got ourselves a blockthe block was very plain looking and didnt suggest anything other than a run of the mill taste was to come  fingers were crossed that the dreaded cword compounded wasnt about to emerge  as ive come to discover however looks can be deceiving  these innocuous squares of bittersweet bliss were delightful  not overly creamy or easily dissolved but the kind of dark you can happily chew into enjoying the solid cocoa taste and eagerly reaching for more  it is quite dense in texture and pleasantly filling and would go down a treat with a glass of red  it was also a relief to see that it contains  cocoa solids and no scary ingredientswe are also very straddles the health and safety says ignatius libeert head of sales our approach is focused on quality even for children this is not the case in other countries where one product the hyper cheap for them to be accessible directly to their scholarship  the website goes on to describe their chocolate as the subjects are hollow they preferred the children always sensitive to new figures  hmmm very intriguing and delicious even more sowho produce over  of dark chocolatei assume you mean over  bars of dark chocolate thats an impressive assembly lineno its actually  kilograms which is even betteri was interested to see a full name to a face on a coles brand product and had to check it out my family often have a laugh at coles branding and ignace liebeert was no exception lindt varieties were consumed in copious amounts now coles belgian chocolate is the trend ignace may not be a master chocolatier but at least hes not just a model funny post i had to respondthank god im not alone i completely ignored this stuff until the other night a friend of mine bought some insisting it was really good i laughed at herthen i tried it and im hooked in terms of supermarket chocolate its much better than this new cadburys crap great article normally i completely avoid supermarket brands as it destroys small and medium businesses but when it tastes this good who gives a shitin the past year ive heard some really alarming facts about the international chocolate market   of the cocoa beans used to make the worlds chocolate come from west africa mainly the ivory coast and ghana  presently over   children in west africa are being exploited for their labour in the cocoa industry  many of these children have been illegally trafficked across the borders of neighbouring countries  this is effectively modern slavery  world vision is currently running a campaign to get chocolate companies in australia to provide ethical certification for their chocolate products  i encourage you to check out the campaign email coles to find out where they source their cocoa from and buy brands that can guarantee that fair labour is being used and the growers are receiving a fair price  i can tell you that such chocolate tastes twice as gooddoes anyone know anything about spanish chocolate
the chocolate itself was slightly too sweet but the nougat flavours came through well the finishing flavours were definitely nougat and bittersweet chocolate the mouthfeel was smooth and the balance of flavours never went too far in one direction a tasty little treatlooks delicious i love manner wafers with a hot cup of tea
i noticed this little box of chocs on display prominently in my local thorntons so decided to give them a try they had rather a lot of them on the shelf right at the front of the store so they were either promoting them heavily or it was simply a matter of nobody wanting to buy themthe first thing i noticed was the price p for a very tiny very light g box of  equally tiny and light chocolates theyd better be goodthe actual chocolates are individually foil wrapped and look a little like mini quality street pretty colours but clearly theyre not going for the higher end of the market with thesethe trouble is  and this is something that repeatedly affects thorntons chocolates  that they are just bland its as if the person who came up with this had no real enthusiasm for chocolate but just decided to chuck a few cheapo chocolate recipes form  years ago into a box and sell it for as much as possiblehi domi saw these in woolworths the other day going for pi picked up one of the boxs and actually had to slyly check to see if there was actually anything in itit felt sooooo lighti just put it straight backno point wasting precious chocolate eating time on these and your reviews confirmed that to megreat stuff as ever please keep it up
the first thing i noticed that whilst it was the same price as cadburys standard g blocks it was only g  the classic savings by stealth method used by a lot of food companies these days to hide cost increases  turning over the wrapped showed me that if i was my usual piggy self and ate g of the stuff then id be having at least  of my daily protein intake and  of my energy requirements  that might be handy to knowthe view of the filling did not look alluring  we couldnt see any of the caramelised pieces depicted on the wrapper illustration and the cream filling looked kind of flat and depressed  still ive never been one to be put off by appearance and waded in bravelymaybe this is fourth time lucky for cadbury desserts range because theyve got the crme brulee flavour spot on  this is a lovely creamy mixture with tiny crunchy chips of caramel that crack as you chew through the soft stuff and are the last things to dissolve on your tongue  being a crme brulee filling it is very sweet but thankfully doesnt resemble a cheap condensed milky muck mix  even darkdevotees sapphire aged  and love chunks  loved it and we did actually eat it after our main meal as a pseudo dessert with a cup of tea me wine lc and cold milk s in front of a dvd   the block disappeared within minutes to the great disappointment of all three of uschillingly the ingredients list does a sterling job of putting me off trying to buy and inhale another block straight away  it consists of  sugar and  fat so theres only a measly  left for other hopefully more healthy ingredients  the filling mix wasnt a turn on  vegetable oil milk solids wheat glucose syrup emulsifiers flavours and colours and yet grudgingly i must admit that it tasted pretty damn goodthe fact is we all wanted more and will certainly be seeking out this block again  perhaps to be eaten whilst simultaneously running on a treadmillgreetings from porto portugal the city of port wine just wanted to congratulate you on an excellent blog i only just discovered it yestarday and have already been through all your archives you have reviewed some excellent products many available here in portugal some unfortunetly notit was great to see you review some south african goodies i knoe you havent thoroughly enjoyed them but they certainly bring back great childhood memories the nestl chocolate log and the tex are in fact great chocolates admittedly sweet but they have to be eaten fresh off the shelves here in portugal i have access to some and must admit that by the time they get here even if they are within their validity they have been disappointingim a fan of cadburys and have to say south african cadburys is in my opinion the best ive tasted ill definetly be backwelcome marcia dom and simon are the lucky blokes who have been eating the south african stuff  as the sole australian contributor im sad to say that ive never had the good fortune of finding any south african chocolate for sale down here  can you recommend some good brands to keep an eye out foractually its just me with the south african stuff at the moment  courtesy of a local shop  but i also have a secret agent planning a trip to sa to bring back some more unusual stuff simon gets to travel the world for his job but i dont think hes made it that far yet mrcia  if you find any interesting local chocs we havent reviewed yet maybe youd like to do a review for uswow id love to do some reviews in fact it would be an honouri will definetly go out chocolate hunting this weekend and review them for you with pleasure i must just reinforce that im not a chocolate expert in fact im pretty much a cadburys fruit  nut girl great let me go do some tastingi saw this just the other day in tescos and didnt pick it up because i thought it would be incredibly sicklylooks like im going to tesco today  yeah i miss  bars of dairy milk gram bars are easy for them to jack the price uphi kath i am totally addicted to cadbury creme brulee  i havent enjoyed any of the previous cadbury dessert flavours eitherlemon cheesecake fudge browniebut this creme brulee and the tiramisu are yumthis is how i eat the creme brulee my favourite i use my teeth to carefully lift the thin top chocolate layer off eat that then scrape the creme brulee off and eat that then finally the thicker chocolate base  so much fun to be hadmy old favourite was old jamaica rum n raisin but this is a whole different taste sensation  i hope cadburys keep the flavour going im sure they could add it to their regular range  what do you thinkgday lesleyid love for cadburys to keep their creme brulee and tiramisu flavours and would be even more thrilled if theyd add it to their old gold range as well cos i love flavoured fillings with darkold gold rumnraisin is still available as it is one of the classic bestsellers cadbury have sexed up their old gold range and its a great move  in addition to the normal old gold and rumnraisin they have  raspberry and liqueur  all brilliantkathcan you get ths in the uki really enjoyed the lemon cheesecake and the creme brulee and now the tiramisu next up to try is berry pannacotta though i really miss the lemon cheesecake  that was my favouritei wish they would bring out something like pavlova or black forrest cake or something that would be cool does anyone know where you can the cadbury desserts banoffee pie fromyeah tell me too  we dont have the banoffee pie one in australia
i had hoped to visit a chocolate shop while i was in slovenia but the may day bank holidays put paid to that idea as most of ljubljana was closed on the day we were there i had to settle for one of a range of bars on offer at a less specialized shop and so i plumped for this milk chocolate and crunchy caramel combinationthe chocolate is made with  milk solids and is fairly sweet in itself it also has a slightly musty background taste to it   poor storage or shipping conditions perhapstiny fragments of caramel are scattered liberally through the bar and have lent their flavour to the chocolate as well as providing a more direct flavour when youre finishing off the last few that havent disappeared with the chocolate the caramel has a good strong burnt sugar flavour to itall in all a fairly pleasant if unremarkable bar having said that im not sure i can think of a uk equivalent caramel chips and chocolate bar this seemed to be a fairly generic slovenian choc bar so im guessing that like the majority of europe theyre used to a wider selection of more adventurously flavoured confectioneryobviously its not worth going all the way to slovenia to try this but if you happen to find yourself in that vicinity at least you know that theres reasonable chocolate to be hadid be more than happy to send you some more upscalechocolate shop stuff from slovenia if youd like just email me should you ever go there again look for ledene kocke in the boxed chocolate section i assume theyre still made the translation is ice cubes and theyre dark chocolates filled with mint fondue mmmmmmm
this nestl bar shares most of the features of the bar its apparently copying its quite light quite crispy reasonably chocolatey and a little boring but having said that this is the nicest of the south african chocolates ive tried so far  and also the first time ive seen nestl do anything interesting with aerothe chocolate in this particular bar did taste as though it was on the verge of going a little stale but thats not entirely surprising given it was manufactured over  months ago and has travelled half way around the world it was still quiet edible and quite satisfying with a nice cup of teai cannot find exact dates but tex bar has been around for at least  years does anyone know how long cadburys time out has existed when last did you hear about a caravanit was als a chocolate upon a tyime and seem as if the new ps chocolateas far as i can remember replaced the old lad caravani think it changed around  when apartheid ended and so theyve also killed poor caravan and as name changes went into action this old granny became ps lmfaohi chrisi remember the caravan chocolate bar very well as it was a favourite of mine when younger it was originally manufactured by rowntrees which was then of course taken over by nestle the ps bar is made by cadburys and is nothing at all like the old caravan from what i remember as far as the taste and textures are concerned and was as far as im concerned oh so much more delicious the bar was not very thick either but had alternating layers of chocolate wafer and caramel and seemed to be a lot more chewy than a ps bar however you cant discount the effect a little nostalgia may have in enhancing the overall memories eithertime outs have existed for  years meaning it was launched in oh i long for a caravanwhy did they discontinue this marvellous eatcaro you right it is more like cadburys time out copying tex as it has been around since before i was born years ago the original makers were rowntree and they sold the rights to nestle rowntree made it better in my opinion anyways these chocolates are so much better than hersheys or other american chocolate it is no wonder these candy bars can be given out so generously during haloweenwhat every happened to tex bar chocolate  it had caramel inside and the chocolate was beautiful  i think it was made in qld  it would be over  years since i have since this chocolate bar aroundthe australian tex bar in s and early s  also had a bit of mashmallow with the carameli am now  years old and a south african expat living in the uk and remember tex and other nestle products all available as a child tex was originally a wilsonrowntree countline along with the likes of bar one caravan chocolate log  peppermint crisp all of which totally outsold and outranked anything produced by cadburys or nestle at the time including time out which was not availalable in south africa in fact wilsonrowntree locked out the top  countlines in south africa prior to the nestle take over of rowntrees a decade or so ago now lest anyone forgets even kit kat was a rowntree product originallyis it unhealthy to eat more than  tex bars a daytimeout was released in  tex has been in sa for at least  years they are a great snack chocolate light and enjoyable as said tex aero kitkat chocolate log and barone by rowntree and then nestle were the best selling counter line chocolates i am amazed that nestle have not tested them out elsewhere it would be a relatively cheap as the product is developed and if nothing else the around  million south africans in uk will buy themtex bar is not a copy of time out tex bar is a good chocolate thats been around for decades formerly rowntree when it tasted better and tastes and looks a whole helluva lot better than the crappy time outi really like time outs they are better than kit kats we dont have tex here in ireland so nestl should obey this message bring tex bars to irelandit here anywhere in the uk where one can buy tex bar chocolate i normally get mine from sai use a site that sell a whole range of antipodean treatshttpwwwsanzacouknestletexbaraspcould you tell me a bit more information about subscriptionsdid they stop making itplease let me knowtex still mmy favouritefor the answer on the tex chocolate bar i brought two at the matilda service station mango hill queensland on the  and really enjoyed themthey were the time i brought them like a big size timeoutsomeone should contact nestles and find outstumbled on this blog while product name searching   still living in south africa and this brings back childhood  the amount of expats in every single country must have really done something for dna biodiversity i shall run out and buy all the above name chocs and eat them on yalls behalfhow i long for a caravan bar  it was my favourite chocolate and i miss them dearly i still live in sa and i often think about them and remind all my mates that had forgotten how do i get nestle to make them again seriouslyyes bring back the caravan chocolate the bestanyone know how the tex got its name  thankshi does anyone maybe have an image for the caravan chocolate barwhat are you talking about tex has been a feature of my diet for over  years was first introduced to it as a child when my father was working in south africas mining sector time out is a much later invention better than time out kit kat or the others i have come across thus far i remember another wafer choc bar from my childhood in za what was it called caravan now that was a chocolate barthe tex bar was made by hoadleys in australia as was the violet crumble and the polly waffle  the was also a mintex bar but this went off the market first  why do so many good products disappear  does anyone remember cottees mint julep cordial it was deliciousanother tasty chocolate bar was made by smalls chocolates in australia  its called smalls arabian chocolate and had a coffee flavour  it disappeared in the early s and was a great loss  smalls recipes were taken over by nestle but they refuse to recreate the arabianwell  tex has been reduced to a biscuit lately it had at least  chocolate a few years back and now maybe  to  if you are luckydear aangirfan i had similar feenligs about davis and was heartened that someone had apparently broken ranks and was trying to raise awareness of possibly the most serious threat to our way of lifewelleverunfortunately however it seems as though this is not the casewhile its true that some of the notions icke has put his weight behind have certainly been hard for many to swallow this shouldnt detract from other more thisdimension information that has become more widely known through himin respect of david davis im talking specifically about his connection to big brother itselfhe has been strongly supported by ed vaizey mp michael gove mp and colonel tim collins who are all original signatories to the statement of principles of the henry jackson society a neoconservative think tank set up in britain in  and named after the us senator henry scoop jackson one of the icons of the neocon movement in the united states that has controlled the bush administration since it came to power and orchestrated the invasions of afghanistan and iraq and the war on terror in general international patrons of the henry jackson society include richard perle douglas feith william kristol robert kagan and former cia director james woolsey all of whom were in the forefront of the instigation of the war on terror through their neocon think tank the project for the new american century whose key members include dick cheney donald rumsfeld and paul wolfowitz indeed kristol and kagan were cofounders of the project for the new american century the henry jackson society is britains version of the same project for the new american century  another of the original signatories to the henry jackson society is sir richard dearlove who was head of mi at the time of the invasions of afghanistan and iraq and the launch of the war on terror davis himself has been paid to speak by the american enterprise institute the sister organisation of the project for the new american century and the neocon think tank the hudson institutehe also invited patrick mercer mp to support his byelection campaign yet mercer has connections to private security firms and companies that produce and sell the very big brother surveillance and control technology that davis is complaining aboutand lets not forget that davis is in favour of capital punishment and voted for the invasion of iraq id prefer to think that davis is making a stand for us and our liberties unfortunately the closer one looks the less likely this seemshighestpentosps i enjoy your blog greatly  keep up the good work
my daughter and i were perusing the plethora of mothers day chocolates on sale at our local kmart the other day when this rather attractive chinesestyle box caught our eye  it had been marked down from  to  and yet was nowhere near its usebydatenow the chinese manufacturing industry toys in particular hasnt been enjoying particularly good publicity of late and the shoddy little lucky chocolates g sticker hastily stuck on the lower right of the box probably didnt fill any of my fellow chocoshoppers with confidence  however at  discount we thought they were worth a try and if not my daughter would at least have found herself a nice trinket boxat  cocoa solids these adorable little squares tasted like a creamy blend of milk and dark chocolate and had a delicious sprinkling of finely chopped almonds throughout  they melted in the mouth easily and lingered on the palate afterwards  not too sweet but not bitter  just moreish with my daughter eating four and wanting four more  they would be an ideal introduction to the world of dark darker darkest chocolates for those still wavering on the milky sideit was comforting to read the remaining ingredients listed and not see anything other than the usual elements found in good chocolate cocoa butter full cream milk powder cocoa mass sugar almonds and vanilla flavouringthe table stuck underneath the box tells us they were manufactured in china but distributed here in australia by evans confectionery quality confectionery since   never heard of em  no website for evans was found just listings in business directories  no other mention of who made them in china and perhaps were better off not knowing  a little bonus buythe word on the chocolates says fu which means prosperity  but you got the photo upsidedown  sorry zizagza but i photographed the box the right way both times  maybe thats why they were such a bargain because the label was stuck upside down on the front of the boxi wouldnt say that its upside down because in asia we see the character fu upside down as well  i think the label was stuck on correctly if im not wrong it symbolises pouringsprinkling of prosperity on people  haha  cant really describe it wellthe label on the box is right  just the photo of the chocs is upside downoh yeah ast you are right  upsidedown in mandarin sounds like arrive so people do paste the fu upsidedown to symbolise that prosperity arriveswhich brings us to the point that these chocs were probably made for chinese new year which was in february which means they have been sitting on the shelf for a while nowi know this post is old but i must say that the chocolates were upsidedown on purposeits a gift and upon opening it  you see many signs of prosperity coming to you as zigzagza put it  arriving 
i am no stranger to coincidence i find things things find me for example i managed to locate an old friend who had moved to milan just by looking on the internet that however is not the coincidence that concerns us here it just so happens that right across from my hotel on the via suzzani is a small artisan chocolate shop run by a gentleman by the name of franco aguzziin the interests of research and in order to avoid any more obvious flavours i picked out only four of the hand made chocolates i was also given a small slab of white chocolate studded with coffee beans as an extra samplethe first chocolate i tried was called passito franco told me that it was made with a wine that is widely available in italy and has its origins in sicily and tuscany the chocolate shell barely survived cutting for the photo it just fell away from the rich dark truffle filling when i tasted it i was immediately impressed with the intensity of the cocoa flavours dark rich cocoa with light citrus topnotes the wine truffle filling  added a wonderfully complex extra sweet note to the mix its a sweet dessert wine like  flavour which blends with the citrusy notes in the chocolate superbthe second truffle was a pinot doltre po which contains a more local tuscan wine the top of the shell was wafer thin with a good solid base as the top part of the shell disappeared a mildly alcoholic orangey lemony flavour complex came flooding out at its peak this chocolate tasted almost like alcoholic pineapplelast up in the dark quartet i tried a few ciliega candida ricoperta   candied cherries to you mateytheyre very similar to the cocktail cherries you can buy in the uk preserved in sugar and wrapped in the same dark chocolate as their alcoholic brethren they were definitely sweeter treats i enjoyed the chocolate more than i did the cherries but there again i used to eat cocktail cherries when i was a kida slab of white chocolate would never be my finish of choice but it was recommended to me to try and well italy is quite well known for coffee so i accepted because theyve used crushed roasted coffee beans the coffee flavour really doesnt get to come out and play until the chocolate is long gone and i found myself cheerfully crunching the beans for ages whereas i had merely been waiting for the sweetness of the white chocolate to clear off and leave me and the coffee to our own businesswhat are the hours of the shop
if i buy haighs most popular product  a ten pack of their little chocolate frogs milk chocolate dark chocolate or milk peppermint they tend to have a life expectancy similar to that of a real amphibian shoved in a foillined paper bag for a bus ride home ie extremely limited  therefore i decided to buy a selection of products in the hopes that some would remain unsullied enough to write abouthaving seen the factory staff delicately and skillfully hand make the truffles that haighs are also famous for i selected three to describe  thats right only three but it gives me many other opportunities to keep visiting and trying other varieties for you dear readerill tell you about their dark bars in another post as well as their lemon myrtle creams passionfruit creams berry chocs dark peppermint crunch mandarin creams vanilla almond dark and chocolatedipped orange slices  not to mention their giant g frogs cointreau truffles rocky road macadamia nougat white strawberry block berry mousse dark centres roasted almonds caf latte trufflescomments are closed
inside this rather attractive cardboard box are eight small individually wrapped barsin fact cadbury seem to have positioned dairy milk melts quite specifically reading between the lines its aimed at a yearold married working mother from yorkshire who is watching television with a cup of coffee in the evening i particularly like the line which starts children are clearly detrimentalcadbury obviously knows its audiencebut enough of this frivolity you want to know what the chocolate is like right well youll be pleased to know that its completely divine easily the best variation on dairy milk that ive tasted in a long long timelet a chunk melt on your tongue and the creamy milk chocolate slowly melts away leaving the trufflelike dark chocolate centre as you might expect the trick is to let a single chunk melt slowly and when you do the flavours gradually build becoming richer and more chocolatey but the taste isnt at all bitter just more intensea lot of thought has obviously been put into the development of melts and i think that has paid off im genuinely looking forward to trying the rest of the range and if youre a married working mother from yorkshire i recommend trying them for yourselfive notice dairy milk bars available in places they werent before maybe theres a push on but these sound wonderful ill keep a look outwe dont have melt product here in andhra  colud u please tell me how can i get itoooh i love these little things  i dont fit the demographics being a  year old single woman living in london but i still like em  it panders to one of my rather more disgusting habits of dunking chocolate in tea  i apologise for that but i only do it with your bog standard chocolate like cadburys and galaxyhmmm chocolate in tea love chocolate love tea why not thanks for the ideawhere can i buy ithmmmmmmmmm i like dark chocolatessssssss very muchdo you remember cadburys or was it rowntrees chocolate orange it has a nice orange flavor in the orangeshaped chocolate chunksthe popping candy ones are devinei just loveeeeeeee cadbury
i found this in an austrian service station while driving from brno in the czech republic to ljubljana in slovenia no reallyi remember when i tried my first lime chocolate bar a couple of years ago i found it in germany and it scored a big hit with me that was just plain chocolate with lime oil though a much less fancy affair than this i had high hopes for a lindt lime baras soon as you bite into a piece of this chocolate your tongue hits the tangy sweet lime jelly the mousse in the base starts to melt mingling with the lime jelly and drifting away leaving the bittersweet dark chocolate as the finishing taste the mousse is light and delicate rich but not overly sweet had there been much more sweetness in this bar besides the lime jelly it would have become far too sweet for the rich dark chocolate the green pepper element is held in the jelly and is much less fiery than i had anticipated it is possible to taste the green peppercorns but they by no means overpower any of the other flavours its a slightly spicy tangily citrus combination held in check by smooth rich dark chocolate the citrus notes in the chocolate make a great finish with the light peppery warmth  more great blending of flavours from the great lindtanother awesome combination from lindtit can only be a matter of time before they come out with a curry and hamster flavour somewhere in europe and i bet itll be divinewell if there is ill do my best to find it im hoping to visit perugia again tomorrow chocohotel timehttpwwwpoofysheepcomdoes anybody know where i can buy this in the uk or by mail order please my mother adores it but seems to have become much harder to track down in germany have the discontinued it
it wouldnt be europe if i couldnt find another previously unknown lindt bar or two this is one of a brace i bagged in vienna and as you can see from the packaging lindt have decided to go all rustic with their provence rangewhat we have here is a  bittersweet chocolate with a hint of orange flavour which is backed up by the somewhat unusual inclusion of thyme and that is exactly what you get pop a square of this into your mouth and you immediately get a light tangy orange flavour as the bittersweet chocolate starts to melt the subtle thyme flavour is allowed out onto your palate building in intensity as the chocolate breaks down the finish is a rather delightful herbycitrus combination which never becomes too much of one thing its a well balanced combination of tastes which hopefully will be sold more widely across europe ie in the uk pleaseive tried chocolate with herbs before when in belgium but ive never seen anything like this on sale as a bar before as someone who loves the tang of thyme i was very pleased to be able to taste this bar the citrus flavours are very summery and the addition of thyme gives the whole thing a slightly unusual twist highly recommended and i wish id bought more than onewow  i hope you can feel my jealousy from here simonive just been to a blind chocolate tasting evening with blind belgian beer tasting too and had the pleasure of trying some thyme chocolate from bruges  i dont know the make of it but it was gorgeous  and i normally hate flavoured chocolate  now i need to go to bruges to get some more
the packaging describes it as creamy marshmallow on a crisp wafer and being a fan of all things light and fluffy i had high hopes for thisunfortunately it seems to have been damaged somewhat in transit im not sure but im starting to think all these chocs have been imported from south africa in someones pocketgiven the nature of this bar soft filling with a thin layer of milk chocolate and the fact that it has travelled at least  miles to get to my tummy some squashage is inevitable but that shouldnt affect the taste and chocolate log doesnt taste anywhere near as nice as i had hopedthe wafer and the milk chocolate are fine standard nestl fare but the slightly odd flavour of the marshmallow spoils what could have been something greatoh well  south african bars down  more to go things can only get better rightwafer and marshmallow sounds dry and tastelessnot my favourite but i still love it what a sensation  a mouth watering chocolate  love it
however next to the old favourite at my local shop was a new flavour honey almond nougat  well i had to buy them both and try them out for you didnt iluckily for me the classic picnic bar was nice and fresh  crunchy peanuts crispy thin wafer and nice chewy layers of caramel with a thick coat of dairy milk  weightwise the bar is a fifty gram log of which  was fat  certainly not one of the healthier choccies to chew on but sinfully satisfying nonethelessi admittedly didnt have particularly high hopes for the honey almond nougat variety cadbury had previously released an unsuccessful chochoneycomb version a year or so ago and i thought id done a thorough job of eradicating it from my memory  obviously not i recall feeling as though i was eating a forest log filled with semidried bumble beesonce again luck was on my side picnicwise  this one tasted delicious  the full flavour combination of honey nougat and almonds was very noticeable and it perfectly complemented the dairy milk coating  it was reassuring to read on the ingredients list that it did indeed contain roasted almonds real honey and egg white a key ingredient of nougat  note to cadbury  real ingredients are noticeable and are appreciatedim trying to work out if thats different from a uk picnic its been so long since i had one but im just not quite curious enough to go out and buy one to see does the australian picnic not have raisins in  oh i dream of a raisinless picnic   aw go on dom live on the edge and buy yourself a picnicamanda our aussie version has never had raisins in it  thank god because it sounds awfulit is pretty bad kath  but then i have never been a fan of the shrivelled grape  chocolate combination  
this time around the product being copied isnt as obvious from the packaging but im quite sure the name will have come up at the ms product meetings where they discussed this bari happened to have some gbs  and was able to compare the formats of the bars are slightly different but the average person would not be able to tell them apart on taste alonenow in theory third parties making good quality dark chocolate is a good thing but as with the ms version of toblerone this bar was more expensive than the original but more seriously theres absolutely no information on country of origin or indication that any of the ingredients used are organic or fair trade  and thats a major reason why many people buy green  blacks productsso while this is a perfectly decent bar of chocolate once again i find myself recommending you go for the original insteadhmmm  i kind of get more of a lindt vibe from just looking at it not tried it yet  how does it compare to the lindt  excellence bar  one of my favourite darksyes from the shape does look more like one of the lindt offerings but the flavour isnt as complex as a lindt excellence although i dont have any on hand to compare it directlyi agree it does seem to look more like a lindt bar im a huge fan of lindt sort of a fall back chocolate when i dont have anything else  not because its lesser just because its easier to get odd how a company would charge more for their copy than the original especially with no origin listed im surprised people buy itbut hey you didthis is my all time favourite dark chocolate and i just had to defend it id say that resembles lindt far more closely than g  bs which has a more bitter flavour my husband not a choco can tell them apart with no problem i buy it now in preference to lindt as the ms version does not contain milk which suits my dairy free diet and i actually prefer it it does state on the packaging made in switzerland i advise you to try itthis is my favourite dark chocolate anywhere in the world and i always stock up when im passing through the uk  it demolishes the horribly sour over hyped lindt  the only other bar chocolate that comes close is alprose  but ms has a slight edge  it really is a wonderful chocolate  i would love to know how manufactures it
i am it seems officially stupid either that or blindthere i was standing at the bus stop  yards from my front door out of chocolate and needed to go and find some review material i idly stared into the window of the south african butchers shop next to the bus stop my eyes flicked across all the weird and wonderful meats hanging up and there it was the south african butchers shop has a south african chocolate shelfneedless to say i immediately went in and bought everything they hadso while this is an interesting novelty for a brit its not something id want to buy regularly im sure there are kids who would love it but its just too sweet for my taste and at  for this imported g bar i dont think ill be buying more in a hurryi remember when these were available in england and i have to say i was a little disappointed when i tried it then  im not big on putting different types of chocolate together anyway and it just all seemed to blur into one getting  as you said  too sweetcrikey isnt this available in england  its been freely available in australia for years now  they also have a triple version with dark chocolate in it which is a guilty pleasureawww man i thought i was missing out on it not being available as regular top deck in ireland but theres one with dark choc im going to have to buy some online now live the dreeeeamactually as a chocoholic who prefers milk and white chocolate to dark i must confess that this chocolate bar is rather divine granted it is sweet but you only need a little to achieve satisfactiondairy milk outside of the uk is always differentamerican one is way too sugary taste of sick made by hersheyssouth american one is just flavourless made in argentina and distributed throughout why cant they just make it like we do i dont get itwow i literally picked up this bar the other day too and was thinking of reviewing it this evening on chocolate mission i best leave it a days now  im sure everyone will be too top decked out if i do it too if anyones intrested in getting hold of south africanaussienew zealan cadburys bars there a few good sites out therealternatively you could always enter the competition thats being run on chocolate mission at the minutehttpchocolatemissionblogspotcomaprilrdcompetitiontimehtmloliver i guess the difference is partly down to sourcing ingredients from different places  that can make a huge difference to the taste of chocolate ive no idea if the dairy milk recipe is the same worldwideone would think that cadburys would have some pride in a universal tasting product imagine if herhseys produced lindt with their own american definition of chocolateactually this chocolate is  and has been since i can remember and im   available here in australia ive loved it since i can rememberlove top deck i love cadbury di tried this bar  years ago i cant get it where i live i would love to get alot more of this bar it was so goodi used to buy this bar of top deck chocolate all the time  yrs agobut then the shops near where i live stopped selling itand i havent seen it in england since was telling my bf about it and he thought i was making it all up as hed neva heard of top deck chocolate  before so i typed the name of the chocolate into google to prove apoint bring back top deck chocolatethats wot i say you get the best of both milk and white chocolate especially when its cadburys best chocolate everthe cadbury decision to stop selling the top deck bar in irelanduk was ridiculous they should bring it back it was a great producthave you tried the new zealand made cadbury top deck had it when traveling there a few years ago it was great i have found a online shop that sell both a g south african bar and a g new zealand bar quick reliable and reasonably priced website toohttpwwwsanzacoukcadburytopdeckkingsizeasphttpwwwsanzacoukcadburytopdecksouthafricaasp
if theres one thing ive discovered since i began writing for chocablog its that modern chocolatiers love to experiment with texture and flavour alas its still the case that continental chocolate makers seem to have the upper hand when it comes to variety and well odditytake this for example there i was strolling through athens on my way to get the plane home when i espied this sitting in a rank in one of the shops french organic chocolate with seaweed in a greek airport  you couldnt make it up of course i had to buy it chocolate and seaweed who wouldnt besides im quite partial to a bit of seaweed anywaynow im assuming that because its organic well everything but the seaweed is the manufacturers decided to go for the recycled brown card look for the packaging unfortunately the result of this was that my immaculate bar of rich dark posh chocolate was a little scuffed and broken by the time i slid it out of the sleeve at home still it never affects the flavour does itthe underside of the bar has been dusted with tiny flakes of dried seaweed brittany seaweed to be precisethe chocolate itself is fantastic rich dark smooth and tangy with elements of citrus spice woody notes and a soft lush mouthfeel the seaweed flavour is there but very subtle if anything combining it with the chocolate serves to bring out the slightly sweeter tastes it possesses and at no time do the two tastes do battle on your palate in short delicious if a little left field but since when was that an issueid recommend this to any chocolate lover just based on the quality of the chocolate alone but i genuinely enjoyed having those flakes of seaweed tickling my tastebuds as well great work and i hope to find more very soon although athens is a bit of a slogvery interesting im sure you could combine chocolate with a lot of things and it would taste good assuming you start with a good quality creamy dark chocolate you could add anything sweet salty spicy or especially something bland like seaweed that gets easily overpowered and succumbs to the chocolately goodness im not knocking the bar just saying that its akin to deepfriedanything is still darn tasty
as you can see this bar shares the same tongue in cheek design as the rest of the heavens above range looking at the back of the box i can see that it contains  cocoa solids that the main ingredient is sugar and that it cost  but it does also apparently contain real orange oilbiting into the bar and you can tell why sugar is listed as the main ingredient its pretty sweet although its also quite creamy the orange flavour is quite pleasant and the overall effect is well acceptablebut it doesnt taste like a premium chocolate in any way and thats a major issue for a bar that retails at  for g while the chocolate itself is not offensive in any way its simply not worth anything like comments are closed
i recently spent a couple of days in athens and of course any trip abroad instantly turns into a chance to hunt for new and unusual bars to bring to your attention after all most of us holiday at some time or another and if you read chocablog regularly you might just be interested in knowing whats good to nibble on while youre having fun in the sunthis bar is made by kraft probably better known for their dairy products here in he uk and it boasts a praline and wafer the waffle part layer coated in milk chocolate the praline layer is given extra texture by the addition of crushed caramelised hazelnutsi found the combination of textures chocolate light crisp wafer and nutty praline rather pleasant but the sugariness was overwhelming when i tested it on the junior tasting corps they lapped it up of course but i was very careful not to give them too much in one sitting lest i had to strap them down laterpersonally i could see myself really enjoying a dark version of this bar made with better quality chocolate and less sugar perhaps kraft might go posh and start making more adultoriented choccies but until then ill be avoiding this onei have had a couple of lovely holidays in various greek islands and i think the collective sweet tooth is probably the reason  there are lots of desserts and confectionary made with large quantities of nuts syrup honey and sugar  very tasty though    in fact on both trips i saw very little evidence of chocolate at allwow thats a lot of sugar it hardly seems like chocolate at all i do like those crispy wafer things but even those cheap wafer cookies you can buy with the filling inside are overly sweet in general i try to steer clear of the big commercial chocolate making companies they always use the most amount of sugar to cut costsits my favourite chocolate you should be avoiding it all chocolates in greece are filled with that much sugar you know but we dont have many kinds of different chocolate ive been abroadthe chocolates abroad are way better than here unfortunatelylactas very sweet but im rather fond of their new cream  liquid caramel bars as well as their moussefilled bars  ions the best though
in fact if you were to go on looks alone you would swear this is exactly the same bar but looking at the ingredients it does appear to be very slightly different from the mahony bar with  cocoa solids and g of fat per g its clear what this is its a generic nobrand version of the mahony bar made by frey with slightly inferior ingredients to distinguish it from their own barbut it cant be that different because it looks and tastes exactly as kath described the honey pieces dont have quite as much flavour as a toblerone and the chocolate is a little sweeter and creamier but this is definitely a winnerbut heres the kicker one of the main attractions of the mahony bar is that its cheaper than toblerone well this g bar cost me  you can pick up a g bar of toberlone for p im not entirely sure whats going on here are we paying a premium for the ms brand that wouldnt surprise mein conclusion while this is a tasty little bar to try if you happen to be passing a marks  spencer food store its probably not going to be much more than a curiosity simply because the real thing is cheaper  and bettertobleronethe swiss toblerone btw great cat picturehi therenow we used to love mountain bars where i used to work a good  yrs ago  moreso than tobleronehavent had one for ages though  maybe theyre not as good nowadaysgreat blog by the way  photos are always goodjohnjohn oh this was nice but toblerone is in my opinion nicer  and cheaperwhen ms cant do better they just imitateterrible really we had a bp garage here which was served by a small but convenient and well stocked safeways ms took it over and upped the price on everything except lindt excellencegood article as ever have tried this bar before but prefer toblerone have you ever tried it with ice cream  i used to eat these quite a bit a few years back you know for something which could have been redesigned from the ground up they only succeeded in making just as awkward as the originalbetter than toblerone i say  as well as at ms its now available at sainsburys and aldi
well i was in athens airport of all places when i clocked a couple of new bars in a display of dolfin chocolate so naturally i snapped them up a new twist is that this is apparently a limited edition for  entitled summer memories possibly a slightly optimistic name for a chocolate bar given the appalling summer weather we endured last yearapple crumble also had my mind ticking over were dolfin trying to recreate a classic english dessert or was i taking crumble out of contextof course its well worth looking out for yes it tastes fab unfortunately i have no idea how long this will be around for its one of four that are being made available for this year only exact dates prove elusive so my advice would be if you see one buy it you cant really go wrong with dolfin chocolate if you like the sound of what the wrapper tells you is inside it seldom disappointsthis looks wonderful i hope i see it somewherewow ive never heard of an applecinnamonchocolate combination either what a shame its a g block and not g ehthat one totally missed the mark for me perhaps i didnt think that the dark chocolate and freeze dried apple flavors really went together but im also not a fan of pear and chocolate eitherany idea where i could get this from in the ukcybele  strange you should bring up pear and chocolate it has proved elusive in the uk but recent excursions mean ill be reviewing a couple of pear bars very sooninteresting twist i like it
i must confess that i was a little mystified by this bar when i looked at the ingredients i saw that this milk chocolate was  cocoa  top of the range stuff indeed the problem is the extra ingredients this bar has been sprinkled with an assortment of mallow pieces and pale looking mini cookies and the overall impression is of something made by a small childthats before we even get to the tastewhen i sniffed the slab i was amazed at how sickly sweet it smelled the mallow and biscuit combination had tainted the whole thing with a sugary almost artificial aroma which almost entirely masked the underlying cocoa smell and which i found deeply unpleasantim all for interesting tastes in chocolate i enjoy sampling  strange and unusual flavours discovering new taste combinations and innovative recipes but this bar just came across as something pretty good spoiled by unnecessary overegging not a winner in my book
this particular bar is enhanced with the addition of hazelnuts and raisins obviously only enhanced if you like hazelnuts and raisins  it could be downright scary if you suffer with a nut allergy and pure flavour havent scrimped on the fruit and nut oh no  this little beauty is studded with crisp fresh tasting roasted hazelnuts of the first order and they sit alongside an equally generous portion of lovely plump sweet raisinsi liked this a lot the high quality of the extra ingredients makes for a great combination with the raw chocolate providing a great crunchychewy double whammy mr cadbury never made anything like thisobviously raw chocolate producers like pure flavour arent going to be scrimping on the quality or quantity of their ingredients all of their ingredients are top notch healthy full of flavour and obviously good for you of course this sort of thing doesnt come cheap but if you want to be able to eat chocolate in its natural form and to know its doing you good as well then you should check out this and the conscious range as well ive become very fond of the slightly unusual flavours of raw chocolate more converts neededcomments are closed
the chocolate itself is a dark  cocoa blend with superb woody citrus tastes and a wonderfully soft mouthfeel as it melts away the citrus notes are amplified and the finish is a slightly spicy almost coffeelike flavour with dark strong cocoa undercurrents in short it tastes fabas previously stated the fact that this chocolate is made on the basis of equitable trade means that the people who made this get a fair chunk of the proceeds and as we are becoming more aware cheap food comes at a price  usually to the producer i have no objections to paying higher prices for top quality products provided my money is going to the right people  ie the farmers and workers who produced the stuff in the first placethis bar and its sister the mora mora bar are readily available in sainsburys here in the uk if youre looking for a treat for a special treat and want to be part of the whole fairtrade revolution then i recommend this on both fronts
so when i picked this box off the shelf of the brent cross branch of thorntons yesterday i didnt really think twice about it i just picked the box that stood out the most the yellow oneas it turned out this was one of my better chocolate purchasesthis box cost  and contains  summer themed chocolates they areits difficult to taste the peach in this as the raspberry flavour all but overwhelms it but then peach isnt a particularly intense flavour anyway the raspberries are possibly a little too instense for the creamy milk chocolate and theres a slight clash of flavours here not my favourite of the bunch but still pretty goodprobably the plainest of the bunch but deliciously chocolatey and light with a very slight hint of alcohol a simple idea perfectly executedanother light mousse filling this time with a subtle orange flavour im not a major fan of orange and chocolate partly because its a flavour combination thats been done so often but the taste is spot on here its subtle enough to work with the cream mousse and milk chocolate but strong enough to know its made with real orangesthe most unusual of the chocolates in this collection the blackcurrant jelly is very strongly flavoured as is the dark chocolate the two go together quite well but dont work that well with the crme frache a delicious chocolate but its noticeably richer than anything else in the box and im not convinced it fits in that wella wonderfully light creamy vanilla flavour which perfectly complements the white chocolate this ones particularly sweet and the dark chocolate isnt particularly noticeable but thats just the way it should be intentionally sweet but light enough not to be sicklyi love freeze dried strawberries anyway so this was always going to be a winner the filling is soft and light the white chocolate is smooth and creamy and the dried strawberry has an intense flavour that gets fruitier as it melts in your mouth divinethis is very obviously made with real lemons and has a really zesty hit when you first bite into it the lemon is almost liquid so that flavour hits you first there isnt much meringue and the white chocolate is very thick and a little too sweet for my tastes but thats a minor complaint another fruity winneroverall these are some of the nicest chocolates ive tasted this year and probably the nicest thorntons chocolates ive ever tasted if i had to fault them at all it would be because of the packaging its adequate but quite plain and doesnt shout quality like the chocolates inside dobut if you can get past that which im sure you can these make the perfect gift for someone who likes lighter fruitier chocolates from the moment you open the box youre hit by a wave of fruitiness and a quick glance at the list of ingredients confirms every one of these chocs is made with  real ingredientsi still have my doubts about the thorntons brand but these are highly recommendedthose chocs look goodbyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
mostly the tone of chocolates sampled here at chocablog reside proudly at the upper end of the qualityquirky ingredientsboutique brand spectrum but even we critics like to downscale when were off dutyas such i thought it was high time the faithful aussie classic the wagon wheel got its turn in the spotlight  during my childhood before cds fax machines and microwaves were available wagon wheels were sold at every school tuck shop every petrol station and corner store and were always one of the cheapest snack lines available even today its good to know that thirty years later they still are  only c from my local foodland supermarket  television advertisements from a few years ago featured a nervous lobster hiding in a fishtank at the local chinese restaurant urging us to pick the wagon wheel please pick the wagon wheelessentially the wagon wheel is just two biscuits sandwiched together by a thin layer of strawberry jam and marshmallow coated in chocolate and yet the overall result is delicious  the original size is g but arnotts biscuit company also have minis weighing g each  im sure they are just as yummy but as a great chocoholic once wrote why call a one inch mars bar fun when a foot long one would be much funneri thought it was appropriate to take a photo of the g packet on a magazine that our clearly airbrushed and tightened kylie is on celebrating her fortieth birthday  and yes there is a shop for your shape article in the publication that probably doesnt include any suggestions for proud chocaholics  i doubt that kylie ate as many of these choccy circles as i did yet when i mention them to other grownups they all remember them fondly and then decide to go off in search of one to have with their morning teabeing an old aussie standby that hasnt altered over the years taking a peek at the ingredients list doesnt make inspiring reading because it contains the dreaded cword  compounded chocolate  all is forgiven however because they are a longstanding favourite and the chocolate is but one part of the entire snack  on the plus side at  grams of fat per pack theyre not too much of a threat to the waistline and they do go a long way towards making the clockwatching until lunchtime a little more bearable even more so if you eat twoof course we have both wagon wheels and kylie in the uk too maybe ill do a reviewyou should and yes i think kylies lived more of her adult life in the uk than australia so shes pretty much a pom these daysi like the name but ive never seen anything like it what is compounded chocolate it certainly doesnt sound like its even worth eating to me if its not straight up real chocolatereminds me of mrmtwo biscuits held together by a lawyer is that covered by legal aidwell spotted simon and only fitting seeing as i pedantically found your god one the other dayif only it was made of a thin lawyer  the world would be rid of a fair few more pestswagon wheels are not so easy to find now but a person dedicated to the task can indeed do so i got hooked on them when i was younger when i was standing at a vending machine looking at the weight of each item and its cost i got the most food per buck from a wagon wheel  ie theyre cheaper than a mars bar et al but weigh moreeverytime im in australia i make an effort to imbidbe a few along with picnic violet crumble and crunchiethe mini wagon wheels are not worth the time even to look at they dont have the layer of jam in the middle my advice forget that you ever saw them and pretend they dont exist theyre an insult to wagon wheels
this bar is best described as full fat being made from a blend of  cocoa dark chocolate and hazelnut praline with  pure cocoa butter its so soft that it needs to be kept cool and is  fat  sugar high levels of naughtiness indeedthis is definitely a special treat bar and like the tesco bar something youd be hard pressed to eat more than a few squares of it goes well with a good cup of coffee just keep an eye on how much you eat in one sittingwhere can i buy thiserrm waitrose perhaps
last week i looked at a milk chocolate heavens above with coffee so i thought id look take a look at a dark chocolate one this weekas you can see the packaging is pretty similar with another retro photo with witty caption i should add that i actually felt a little self conscious buying a bar of chocolate with a picture of a man in the bath on the front its not that i have an issue with men taking baths but i just cant see who this is meant to appeal to aside from those looking for a novelty gift the fact that the caption talks about chocolate scented soap doesnt help much either because thats what i instinctively found myself comparing this toa darker chocolate would be better with the mint and you can tell by the color that its not very dark still i love the mint and dark chocolate combo 
the box didnt look too promising  like a recently heartbroken lover id seen too many red boxes of chocolate on discount tables and in crazy daves bargain stores to know that uninspiring red packaging often meant some truly dodgy substances made in kazahkstan or senegal with about as much resemblance to real chocolate as carob without the sugar and oil but with extra dirtit was distinctly cheaper than toblerone and at g looked like a plank of wood you could defend yourself with if the eating of it wasnt a possibility  the hill pattern on the block was similar to toblerone as was the taste  cheeky  if blindfolded i doubt that i would be able to detect the difference  they both taste delicious and mahony was an equal match   this will be too sweet for the serious chocophiles who prefer dark chocolate but it should definitely be sought out and tried by those who love toblerone or are in the mood for some good milkchocolate that melts in the mouth and ends up with some lingering nougat to chew onthe ingredients listed on the back of the box were pretty standard   cocoa solids sugar cocoa butter chocolate liquor milk and nougat  fat content  grams per  grams  oh dear that meant that i just inhaled  grams of fat  my eight year old daughter is right she reckons that if she and i ever owned and ran our own chocolate shop her current dream wed need to install a permanently running treadmill directly behind the counter that id need to stay on all during our work day  mahony is not only better than toblerone it also melts beautifully try this recipe for smores lay two granita biscuits on a baking tray sprinkle some mini marshmallows on the first biscuit on the other a piece of mahony place under the grill when the marshmallows have gently toasted to a dark brown not black remove and press together as a sandwich eat while warmwhere can i find mahony in the usa  ive checked tons of places and cant find it anywhere in the usadid you ever find anyone that sells it in the ushey mandyas far as i know the mum of my gf got it in coles funny enough a friend from australia gave me one bar of mahony thought its just the same as toblerone but to my surprise it is way better than toblerone the nougats perfect the richness of the milk chocolate was superb i love every bite of it coles have it advertised in their current catalogue for  instead of  today is the last day of the sale since friday i am just about to start my second bar so addictivehelloim from switzerland frey is the chocolate company working with the migroschain and i got a mahony g bar from someone ive never had it before and i think its very good as good as toblerone to me i think frey i grew up in the city next to the village where its produced have great products when i was in th grade and had to do a presentation of chocolate they sent me all the ingredients in raw form chocolate beans butter etc which i remember to this day
the ingredients are remarkably similar to conscious dark chocolate  all natural all healthy all yummy  but the bars are somewhat larger and as you can see they come hand wrapped in sellophanein a little experiment i tasted this bar on its own with a clean palate and thoroughly enjoyed it and than after i been eating ordinary chocolate well as ordinary as a posh choc lover can get the second time of tasting was quite remarkable having eaten some normal chocolate the difference in texture and flavour was immediately noticeable this raw chocolate melts incredibly quickly and has a slightly grainy texture the flavours are bittersweet rich and dark with good citrussy top notes and an underlying butter and dark cocoa taste its remarkable how clean the palate is after a taste of this stuff it disappears almost completely leaving the mouth feeling fresh and without any feeling of coating that you sometimes find with other forms of chocolatei still say that this is an acquired taste its very different from chocolate as we tend to perceive it but in a really interesting way also bear in mind that raw chocolate like this is actually good for you organic pure raw ingredients not only taste great they are incredibly healthy as well winwinas ever handmade small batch organic raw products like this come at a premium having said that im willing to bet that eating something like this twice a day could impart some serious health benefitsid recommend trying this its odd at first but every time i eat raw chocolate i definitely feel as though ive ingested something thats doing me some good give it a go and support your local chocolate weaverswow id love to try some of this but ive never seen it mmmm i need some dark chocolate right nowi blame the proof reader
the first thing i noticed about this organic fairtrade chocolate was that it was sealed in plastic even the wrapper notes that this is currently nonrecyclable i find this more than a little odd for an organic fair trade chocolate bar and theres no real need for it in this day and agethat aside and once id managed to break my way through the plastic this turned out to be a wonderful bar of chocolateas youd expect its a solid milk chocolate bar with rose oil in the chocolate itself the milk chocolate itself is obviously made with quality ingredients its deliciously creamy and chocolatey the rose flavour is subtle but makes a real difference to the bar each little chunk tastes like a piece of turkish delight as it melts in your mouth i recommend breaking off a single chunk and letting it melt away slowly its a wonderful refreshing summery tastethe one thing i did notice was that my brain was expecting a chilli hit which never came i dont know if thats because i was conditioned by the chocolate cellars bar or if this ms bar is actually missing something the flavours are all so soft and subtle that it doesnt really give you a satisfying chocolate hit it would be quite easy to eat this whole bar in one go waiting for that hit to come luckily i have excellent self control coughi know there are people who actively dislike rose flavoured chocolate often caused by being forced to eat bad turkish delight as a chilid i find if youre one of those people you may not like this but you should still give it a go  it might just change your mind its one of the nicest milk chocolate bars ive had in a long timei adore good turkish delight and love anything roseflavoured future article on haighs rose cremes will be done someday  however i reckon that rose would go even better with dark chocolate rather than milk  counteracting the sweetness and heightening the perfume perhaps  still the chocolate here still sounds pretty special thoughroast almond is sitting here at the moment  cocoa and yet it tastes a lot richer maybe its the almonds or maybe im a cocoa novicebest wishi love the way you make the chocolates they are so brilllllllllllllllllianttttttttttttttttttti love chocolate so much espically yoursi love chocolateomg its pretty good lol jks
cocoa farm have been shyly lurking on our local south australian foodland supermarket shelves and decent cellar door wineries such as penfolds home of grange for a wee while now but have not been launched or advertised with any fanfare ive been aware of  instead it was the packaging and the flavours that sounded intriguing shiraz wine chocolate and mango lime and chilli no added sugar dark chocolate  luckily too cocoa farm is the only chocolatier in australia that grow their own cocoa as well as make the chocolate  in fact theyre the only cocoa bean growers in australiahowever we had a second block hopefully the first of many to sample the no added sugar mango lime and chilli  well perhaps i asked too many questions because it tasted just like cocoa farms normal dark chocolate and nothing fake or engineered as i dreaded as love chunks commented i can taste all of the ingredients  that might be because the chocolate also has lime and chilli oils in it as well as pureed mango  it results in a very unique taste that almost had me believing i was eating a healthy fruit bar  the chocolate is the first to dissolve leaving behind the fruity chewy remnants of mango and chilli in a refreshing finish never did i think id use the word refreshing to describe a chocolate  as such it would partner up quite well with a chilled glass of champagne or sparkling burgundy  bottoms upim surprised this could have been a disaster mango lime and chili are great flavor combos but if either of them is messed up in the chocolate then the whole thing is ruined once you said no sugar added i thought it was a total loss too bad they dont make this around here us sounds like a unique flavor combo for chocolateexactly  its nice to be pleasantly surprised sometimes isnt it  cocoa farm have a lot of other flavours available and are apparently developing some even more interesting ones in the future so ill keep my eyes peeledyumm nom gimme the good stuffhello there my name is tamara and i am desperately looking for chili essence preferably not oil based if you could help me i would so appreciate any kind of recommendations or refferals thank youthis is the best chocolate  ever  i was just blown away by the flavour and complexity of the chocolate  nothing more will do for me now  im done for unless i can get bulk suppliesthis chocolate is my favourite  not only is it a  dark quality chocolate the combo of lime mango and that chilli kick at the end a real treat and experience
i bought the entire range only  bars to see if things had improvedwhen i got home i inspected the box further and noticed two things firstly the blurb on the backa tongue in cheek range of scrumptious chocolate gifts with a hint of naughtiness only for those with a taste of humourthats a little worrying i always get a little concerned when a product feels the need to tell you how much fun it is or that youve got to be a very special person to appreciate itthe second thing i noticed was that the ingredients simply list coffee flavour  which i presume means some kind of artificial flavouring rather than real coffee so i was actually pleasantly surprised when i bit off a chunk the  milk chocolate is smooth and creamy the coffee taste is just right its not so strong that it over powers the chocolate flavour i ended up demolishing this bar in half an hour without even noticing i was eating itdespite all my reservations this bar is actually pretty good my issue is that its trying to be a premium chocolate and its clearly missing the mark there i paid  for this g bar of chocolate which is way over the odds if it were under   or simply made with better quality ingredients and more attention to detail  id recommend it but at that price i dont think i canthe exhigh school english teacher still lurking in me also takes issue with scrumptuous being spelled scrumtuous as well sometimes humour disguises some pretty unfunny contentsgah the typo is of course mine ill go sit at the back of the classshould i mention toungue at this point thennook i wont
as were probably all aware the major supermarkets have been quick to spot the rise in popularity of good quality chocolate and have been busily creating their own premium chocolate well whereas many of the majors have produced premium own branded chocs tescos have engaged the services of a or started their own different company  cocopiaas well as producing various sized boxes of assorted themed chocolates theyve also cunningly decided to make a range of taster boxes and slabs available obviously not all of the chocolates available in the bigger boxes can be bought in a sixpack but its a good way of trying out a few items to see how they shape upthe shells of these truffles are  cocoa dark chocolate  very thick dark chocolatethe chocolate itself is a lovely dark bittersweet blend with a very pleasant citrus topnote which is tempered beautifully by the saltsweet hit of the caramel interior the shells are so substantial that they outlast the caramel by a long way i found my tongue seeking out the last of the caramel from the hollow in the shell before the rest of the shell melted awayi can see why tesco might want to give their posh chocs a new brand name the cocopia brand and packaging immediately put them on the top shelf in the eye of the consumer and the chocolates themselves are definitely worthy of poshness they are naturally a little pricier than your everyday chocs but not as expensive as other well known premuim brand chocolates i doubt theyd sell half as well if they came in a blue and white box with the tesco branding on them clever marketing on the part of tesco excellent product from their chocolatiers keep and eye out for cocopia and treat yourself sometimehonestly do you think these are a top brand i consider the best kind of brand to be an artisanal confectioner which every major city usually has several of at least here in the us  perhaps you have even more as you mentioned the shells on these carameltruffles are so thick they really overwhelm the caramel and just based on your pictures i couldnt get much info from their website the packaging really doesnt impress me either plastic candy tray inside a clear plastic lid just doesnt say top shelf to methoughtsmmmm chocolate caramel bars it doesnt get much better than that thankfully these sound better than those fairly awful cadbury caramel eggshaving tried these i have to agree  the raspberry and caramel ones are very good tooi love these ones and bought them regularly from my local tesco store in oxford to my great disappointment tesco in oxford is no longer stocking these and i wonder if it is possible to order them onlinethese will be coming out again after julylook out for the new lemon torte flavour too replacing the pistachio mousse and black forest
well bless their sweet little cocoaflavoured hearts theyre making a start by releasing a  cocoa block under the old gold banner  well its better than a start really more like a homerun on their first try   this g slab of paradise is quite honestly the best  dark chocolate i have ever tasted  it hits the spot in terms of strength of cocoa flavour but does it with a teasing hint of sweetness and a far smoother texture and mouth feel compared to the sometimes grittier versions in other brands  it melts on the tongue quite easily and somehow has a creamier constitution that doesnt end with the bitterness sucking out all of the moisture from your mouthas you can see from the glamorous shot above it was sampled actually a couple of blocks were sampled during a house boat holiday on the murray river hence the dodgy arcopal plate resting on the sensible plastic tablecloth so my expectations werent too high  how completely wrong i was  the other guests on board agreed with me and ranged in ages from eight to forty eight  this wonderful stuff was enjoyed with steaming cups of tea freshlybrewed coffee cold glasses of milk and iced coffee  it also coped with being sampled late at night over an ancient version of trivial pursuit with a glass of aussie cabernet sauvignon which is unusual for red wine and chocolate to pair up without a bit of a tussle with the tastebudswell done cadbury for making such a magnificent block of chocolate that is not only the most delicious but also rests firmly  and proudly  in the affordable price range  this can be something that can be eaten as often as your taste buds and waistbands will allow  boy am i looking forward to winter this yearwow the best are you nuts cadbury of all things that is truly shocking with a recommendation like that i must try some i just picked up some  mariebelle  sharffen berger mocha and nib flavor  limited edition sharffen berger  sharffen berger and a  vosges creole bar with nibs coffee and chicory they are all out of this worldyes peanut butter boy the best cadbury  the best a rare combination i know noone was more surprised than i waswhat brand is mariebelle and sharffen berger  i wonder if theyre available here in australiamarie belle is a chocolate shop in nyc but i dont think ive ever seen it in stores i thought sharffen berger was imported to the us but i dont think it is perhaps it is exported sharffen berger is part of a larger brand artisinal creations or something similar the company has a more expensive and artistic line under a different namei dont think i can get that cadbury bar here or at least ive never seen it ill keep my eyes out because  is my favorite range for chocolatei must admit im also shocked by the cadbury idea another couple great brands to try e guittard i personally use this brand in all of my confections coco rouge similar to vosges in the same city even but more artisanal and valrhona marie belle chocolates are available through some retailers you really have to just find them perhaps try getting in touch with them and asking for the nearest location in my experience marie belle chocolates are beautiful and artistic but just dont have the quality of the othersdid you know that cadbury is now adding vegetable oil to all its chocolate  including old gold its supposed to make the chocolate softertheyre adding vegetable oil to old gold too  can anyone else confirm this and whats the taste differencegod the best chocolate because before i think meiji blackchocolate is the best dark chocolate out their but no this is the best althought its quite expensive when you buy  packs but its worth it and it release my stress gives me good memories and makes me hyper i dont know maybe its just me plus its  cocoa and much better anti oxidants btw the packaging of that chocolate above is old the latest one is much more better package much elegant and expensive looking with gold fontsi agree this is a belter of a dark chocolate superior to standard old gold and the standout of the readilyavailable high darks in the supermarket only downside is it doesnt come in smaller packets so you are forced sigh to gradually take on the whole block especially if your family arent huge darkoholicsi am not interested in the snob dark chocolates that have to be sourced directly from ghana or sent in brown paper parcels from the hippie organic shop in town i want to wander down to woollies and hide a bar in with the milk and bread
other countries may get new kitkat varieties on a daily basis but here in the uk its been a while since weve seen any new flavours so i was pleasantly surprised when my routine scan of the local sweet shop shelves turned up something newwhen you bite into it you get a satisfying crunch of wafer followed by the soft if slightly too sweet filling but this is much heavier than a bueno theres more wafer to get through and the cream filling just isnt as light or smoothid still buy this again though if i had to choose between this and bueno the kinder chocolate would win every time  but dont let that put you off trying it and deciding for yourself i had two varieties of those from australia where theyre called temptations i wasnt that fond of them but i was expecting something like a kitkati would like to suggest after eight munchies for a review also a nestle producti just had one of these today well two  i got another after the first interesting its like a mutated kitkat i only just saw it today before this review i didnt know chocolate had national release dates anyway whatever its niceim in america and we never have other kit kat varieties except for whitedark chocolate and the large size  im jealousi hope this new kit kat variety will come to france a friend of mine brought me one and its excellenti saw it and could not believe my eyes you are right not like bueno but still very yummyi have to admit as i guy i particularly like these they may be marketed at girls but then again yorkies are marketed at boys and my girlfriend loves thempicked up a load of these on a recent trip to poland so goodthis is like an orgasm in your mouth girlsan unfortunate choice of words elie but i get what you mean lolyes im sorry for any disrespect but i just can not help it im addicted to this chocolateyum kitkat senses d xlolz elie p have to say i luv kitkat senses xii agree with elie lol p  shame jessica yu should come to englanddo u prefer this or kitkat chunkyykitkat chunchy all da wayhappy haloween chocobloggers have a sweet  scary time lolseriously isnt this just the same as a regular kitkat but quite differently shapes
this time ive chosen a milk chocolate bar to review  one containing apricots and cashew nuts both of which im quite partial to as snack foods of course being seeds of change this bar doesnt contain just any old apricots they use malatya apricots from turkey selected for their succulence and sweetness as for the cashews well theyre just cashews as far as i can tell theres no mention of an exclusive cashew farm in kazakhstan or anythingthe chocolate is of course organic and at  cocoa it has a lovely richness of flavour and a rather sweet taste the cashews are crisp and very flavoursome and the apricots are indeed sweet soft and very tasty its a very well thought out combination of flavours and the end result is a dangerously moreish barhoweveri cant deny that this is a very tasty bar of chocolate and the ethos behind seeds of change is unquestionably on the right track as regards corporate responsibility and giving something back but the labelling of this chocolate bar made me realise that milk chocolate is more likely to be higher in saturates and sugar and by a long margini welcome responsible labelling of foods and i hope that consumers are encouraged to read and understand food labelling so that informed choices can be made i have no wish to discourage readers from trying out this bar but i would certainly advise moderation three or four pieces a day of this bar is quite enough if you want to stay healthy and as we know a little of what you fancy does no harmcomments are closed
the shiraz bar is one of three available the other two being a merlot and a pinot noir and is a blend of milk and dark chocolate with a cocoa content of  the cocoa is actually grown on australias first cocoa farm so this is actually  australian  a first as far as i knowthe chocolate itself is roughly the same colour as the box it comes in its dark but not as dark as a higher cocoa content plain chocolate and it softens on the palate like a milk chocolate the whole bar is peppered with currants and what they add to the taste is a series of fruity notes beginning with an almost immediate cherry flavour as the chocolate melts this softens off a little and you begin to get a slightly peppery taste chew the currants and the final element a subtle currant flavour is released the currants cleanse the palate as you finish tasting leaving your mouth feeling clean and definitely ready for another squarei would imagine that the importation costs contribute to the high price of this bar at almost  for g its definitely one of the more expensive items ive tried of late having said that its definitely a good quality product and another one for those of you who like the unusual also a great pressie for anyone who loves their wine and chocolate like meah but do you agreei would love to try the pinot noir but i would say that a darker chocolate should be used with wine considering wine is not that sweet to begin withyes i agree with your review simon and for once feel lucky that they are much more affordable for us chocolate and wine lovers in  australiai got one of these as a birthday present ive just eaten half of it in a sitting whilst doing a task that would otherwise cause creeping brainrot it really is very nice i completely agree with the review
lily obriens is an established brand from ireland and have been creating fine quality chocolates for around  years this rather attractive box caught my eye and when i discovered that the contents were based on a number of classic desserts i thought it would be fun to review it the crme brle  comes in a white chocolate cup with a crunchy sugar topping which conceals a disc of more white chocolate a creamy filling and a little blob of what seems to be caramel in the base the white cream centre certainly bears the taste of a crme brle but i found the use of a white chocolate made the whole thing very sweet especially with the additional sugar topping the centre may well be full of interesting flavours but that amount of sweet white chocolate seems to overpower the overall flavours the chocolate  toffee pudding comes in a milk chocolate cup and contains a very pleasant tasting combination of flavours the toffee filling is soft and not too rich and combines well with the chocolate its a tried and trusted combination done very well the amaretti torte has a mildly alcoholic flavour to it but is very similar to the chocolate  toffee pudding in its construction a darker cup balances the flavour well and at  the dark chocolate isnt going to be too sharp a contrast with the sweetness of the range the tiramisu  comes in the same milk chocolate cup as the chocolate  toffee pudding and was my favourite of the four its a little on the sweet side but has a very pleasant authentic marsala flavour to the fillingoverall these chocs are the sort of thing id buy as a gift rather than for personal consumption theyre very well presented and pay a fairly reasonable homage to the desserts they imitate however the crme brle and tiramisu chocolates dont come near to the lindt versions we have reviewed in the past but that would be a very big askin general these tend to be quite sweet and while the chocolate is of pretty high quality theyre not the sort of thing youd buy for the cocoa content alone theyd make a very  pretty present for someone you love and offer a nice twist on the theme of dessertsdo any shops sell them in englandi believe i bought these in either morrisons orsainsburysi have now read quite a few comments and reviews for lily o briens chocolates and lots of people have given a lot of praise for these chocolates i was very kindly given a box of the italian collection for christmas and was extremely disappointed the chocolates were tasteless and didnt even melt in my mouthi have no idea what went wrong but i seriously doubt that i will even finish the box because they are so badi was given a box of lily obriens desserts collection and to be honest having never heard of this brand of chocolate i had no idea what to expect not only did they look wonderful but they are absolutely delicious so luxurious i would like to know which retail outlets stock them pleasethese are vile sickly sweet and they all taste the same unfortunatley i have just recieved a second box as an unwanted gift 
it is said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery its also true that theres money to be made by nicking a good ideaunfortunately the resemblance is purely physical sainsburys appear to have used some fairly poor ingredients to make up this slab the dark chocolate isnt very tasty at all the milk chocolate is overly sweet and the mouth feel is cloying sugary and a little unpleasant it soon became apparent that it was indeed all too easy to taste the difference and that the difference was obviously in the quality of the two types of chocolate usedin the past ive been pleasantly surprised by own brand bars of chocolate from the major supermarkets and i have to admit to being a little surprised by how unremarkable this was i always considered the taste the difference range to be some sort of flagship brand for sainsburys but this certainly lets the side down in future i think ill stick to their bars and avoid anything else that looks as though its a copy of someone elses ideathey also look quite similar to a range that tesco did is still doing a few months back called cocopiahttpwwwflickrcomphotosbuhsnarfit wasnt that bad and was only  for a slice
it seems just about every major chocolate brand has an egg version around easter these days obviously its really just a marketing exercise but i still enjoy seeing the weird and often pointless products that like likes of nestl mars and cadbury try to sell us at this time of yearunfortunately this one falls squarely into the pointless category for meonce youve cut open the fairly bland plastic pouch youre greeted with the sweet aroma of well absolutely nothing and some equally bland looking cream coloured eggswhen you bite into one of the eggs that blandness is replaced by an allencompassing sweetness a sweet but otherwise tasteless sugar shell with sweet but otherwise tasteless white chocolate in the centre i simply couldnt pick up any other flavoursnow dont get me wrong when im in the mood im quite partial to the occasional milky bar which is why i bought these in the first place but i dont really get any of the creaminess that i get from a full sized milky bar here either i guess theres just not enough filling even to pick up on thati really wish nestl had managed to do something a little more interesting with these either by taking away a bit of the sweetness of the shells or adding some subtle flavours but for me they taste pretty much the same as eating sugar lumps and thats not something i do for fun  although i guess there are kids who will love them for exactly that reasoni think these are the best mini eggs around there deliciousick they taste like s scuse mah french but milky bars taste like  sweet soapy covered plastic
the life of a chocolate reviewer isnt all freebies arriving by special delivery and i thought youd enjoy these gifts from friends and relations sometimes one has to go out and track down interesting new products to sample and these nobbly nibs are the first item i have ever bought from a hotel chocolat shopthere are two ways of approaching these nibs  throw a few in your mouth and slowly roll them around your mouth or just chew them up whole the first method allows you to experience the full range of tastes an initial bittersweet tang from the cocoa powder is rapidly followed by a superbly smooth creamy chocolate flooding your mouth as it begins to melt considering that the chocolate is  it is remarkably light and smooth tasting the final flavour note comes as your tongue finds the cocoa nibs themselves and when you start to crunch down on them you are rewarded with the raw taste of roasted cocoain essence what we have here are the three stages of cocoa summarised in a single delectable nibble i really liked these moreish little nibs and would love to sample some of the other types on offer well worth checking out and compared to some of the hc range quite affordabledidnt know hc did that kind of thingive had the coppeneur version of these so yummyi love dark choc covered cocoa nibs they are delicious but hard to find and usually expensive now covered in cocoa powder adds a triple chocolate threat level to these bad boys and i really want to get my hands on somenow where do you get all these funds for expensive chocolatethese sound spectacularly delicious just the thing to serve with coffee after dinner
these are exactly what youd expect them to be theyre egg shaped smarties and for that reason alone they rockhiya me and my partner ate a bag of just the smarties mini eggs the other day and we thought they were fab apart from the red ones  the shell had a bitter vegetable taste which was pretty unpleasant i suppose we shouldnt have eaten them all so they couldnt have been that bad  the chocolate inside was fine but i complained to nestle and they didnt give any explanation i just wondered what made the red ones taste like that and if anyone else had found them unpleasant too
this little column of chocolates has the distinction of being manufactured in the most westerley chocolate factory in europe  the skelligs chocolate factory in county kerry ireland i quite literally came across the place by accident whilst driving around the ring of kerry last year we drove past a sign advertising the place and it was a case of brakes on uturn and straight in for a chat and some shoppingits worth letting the photos tell the story of the contentsthe chocolate used in this selection is primarily a  dark chocolate its very smooth with a lovely mouth feel and a combination of light citrus taste and rich cocoa notes the flavours added to the hand wrapped chocolates are mainly quite subtle no explosions of mint or fiery cinnamon more like a gentle hint of each flavour as the chocolate melts the espresso chocolate had a coffee bean studded into each of the four squares the hazelnut does indeed contain crushed nuts and the cinnamon block has a grainy texture from the ground cinnamon in the mixture but at no time do these flavours overpower the important taste  a well blended smooth rich tasting dark chocolateits pretty obvious from the packaging the website and the product that the sisters are passionate about their work the product is made with love and the packaging reflects a young bright funky feel to the whole operation cocoa bean are part of the new wave of chocolatiers  people dedicated to revolutionising chocolate and experimenting constantly to produce new and exciting flavour combinations for us al to enjoy fair play to them for thatas well as being stocked by retailers all over ireland it is also possible to buy cocoa beans products in harvey nichols and cocoa in sheffield obviously they have plans to increase the number of outlets that stock their chocolateswere great fans of theirs and im delighted to see them shop up on your side of things
the egg itself is cast from deliciously smooth  chocolate with notes of citrus giving way to a smooth dark cocoa flavours any lover of dark chocolate should treat themselves to some of this  whether its in the form of an egg a slab or some of their chocolates it really is a wonderful thingamong the six different chocolates contained within the bags you will find a quintet of nutty pralines and chocs each of which is a mini masterpiece theres a noisette praline which has been reinforced with extra cocoa solids giving it an amazing meltinthemouth feel and a smoothness thats hard to believe the dlice de chocolat has sicilian pistachios and italian hazelnuts blended in a praline filling and delivers a complex flavour combination with the pistachios providing a superb top note over the smooth buttery praline and crisp roasted hazelnut flavours the trois noisettes is perhaps the simplest of the six  three hazelnuts bound together in caramel and coated in  dark chocolate but the combination of crisp tasty hazelnuts dark cocoa and the burnt sugar taste of the caramel make it a surprisingly complex blend a gianduja which promises buttersoft texture and delivers just that and a badgi praline topped with a single italian hazelnut make up the quintet which leaves the sixth and perhaps the most interesting treat in the eggthe cocoa pod bunny and easter chick chocolates give you the opportunity to sample rare single estate cocoa from papua new guinea and at  these two chocs pack a lot of flavour as you pop a piece into your mouth the initial flavour of the melting chocolate is a much lighter citrussy note than the hc house blend melting away into a delicate bittersweet high note with an incredibly smooth mouth feel the final taste is light fresh and fragrant quite different from the other chocolate use in the egg and its contentsthis looks a lot better than the one you reviewed previously maybe its because it is dark chocolate which is just always better this looks incredibly tasty though i still think the egg should be whole and not  prewrapped halvesah but if it were whole there wouldnt be any room for the chocolates inside would theresimon you had me drooling at mini masterpiece  lucky sod
i will write later about their selection of cakes such as their original death by chocolate which was also my brother and sisterinlaws fantastic wedding cake and truffles another time today it is their easter fare  i bought a bag of their little easter shapes  bunnies and chicks  because they came in white milk and dark chocolate and their speckled eggs because well they looked really prettyunfortunately neither the bags the brochure on the counter or their website gives any information on cocoa content fat or what other ingredients are in any of their chocolates or other products so ill be writing this on taste and feel alone  even more unfortunately i did not enjoy two thirds of the chocolate shapes  to be fair white chocolate has never been my cup of tea and besides it isnt really chocolate but i just didnt enjoy it the dark chocolate tasted suspiciously like the cooking chocolate thats commonly available everywhere and is mostly used as a coater for other stuff such as dried fruit  out of the three only the milk chocolate tasted nice  yes nice is a very ordinary word and i guess thats exactly what it was just ok nice not mindblowing and certainly not worth the rather inflated pricethe speckled eggs had a coating that was thicker and harder than my poor teeth could handle  when the shell finally cracked for a few awkward seconds it wasnt clear if it was the coating or my own teeth that i was chewing  sadly this obscured the taste of the milk chocolate  it was in there somewhere but over powered by the gobful of gravel that masqueraded as the crispy coating  pretty to look at but not to eatall is not lost however  they have truffles to try heaps of them and they are particularly famous for their desserts so for the sake of good chocolate and you dear readers ill keep tryingi always find that when a company sells chocolates like this and doesnt label the cocoa content then they arent really worth my time these types of chocolate usually have some kind of filler in them usually just more sugar if i want sugar i can buy it by the pound at the storeyou could be right pb boy  ill drown my sorrows in their exquisite mud cake instead
another offering from holland  barretts range of good things covered in chocolate and this time its cranberriesive always enjoyed dried fruit and tend to carry some with me when im travelling or working late as its a great pick me up chocolate coated fruit is of course an alternative way of getting that energy with the added bonus of a good dollop of chocolate into the bargainif you like your fruit im assuming that readers of this blog like their chocolate then its worth checking your local holland  barrett for some of these my own personal preference is for the slightly sweeter and much chewier goji berries despite the fact that theyre erroneously labelled as tibetan but id definitely buy these again just for the varietylooks good to me  is a bit low for my tastes but probably adds a needed sweetness to the cranberrieslooks like a much more fun way to imbibe cranberries for their cystitishealing purposes than by the godawful packets of tea currently on offer at my health food shop
ive lost count of the number of times the postman has knocked on my door with packages from hotel chocolat but this time my reaction was more oh than oooooh the box was much smaller than i had been expectingopening the lid youre greeted with a simple menu of the chocolates inside and a red insert which for some reason is in the shape of a keyhole i imagine this is to give the impression of spying through the keyhole to the chocolates inside but it doesnt quite work for meand then came the first time ive been disappointed by a hotel chocolat productremoving the egg from the box youre left with two halves individually wrapped with a bag of chocolates in each half except when i say wrapped i mean half covered in what looks like bacofoil the chocolates inside are in a fairly flimsy paper bag and appear to have been forced inside the egg in order to get them to fittheres no subtlety here it looks to be a case of forcing as much chocolate as possible into the smallest possible box now normally i wouldnt think twice about this kind of packaging but its simply not up to the high standards hotel chocolat have set themselves whether or not this is a one off or if its repeated on the other eggs in this years range i have no way of knowinganyway after finally removing the rest of the wrapping youre left with two egg halves and two identical bags of chocolates the chocs inside the eggs may be the same but the actual egg halves are very differentone half is the rocky road  thick milk chocolate with chunks of cookie and puffed rice embedded into it the other is thick milk chocolate covered in a layer of hotel chocolates rather divine caramel chocolate i really like this idea  and the chocolate is so thick i can guarantee its going to last a while in fact its so thick i had a bit of an issue breaking the shells into bitesized pieces and ended up smashing them onto the kitchen counteronce you do get into the shells though they are really tasty i adore the caramel chocolate so that would have to be my favourite although i think i would have preferred it if it were solid rather than a thin layer on top of ordinary milk chocolate the rocky layer is of equal quality but so far im finding it hard to eat as it breaks into such irregular shapes with unpredictable hard and crunchy bitsnow we get to the small bags of chocolates inside each bag contains cocoa crisp caramel crunch praline crispy pecan praline macadamia turtles pod bunny caramel canaps and easter chick theyre all nice enough  theyre just a little boringtheyve obviously tried to take the crunchy and caramelly theme over to the actual chocolates but i found them slightly boring   there just isnt enough variety of taste no unexpected fruitiness or alcohol hit no surprises and worst of all the chocolates in one bag had been squashed so tightly into the egg shell that theyd fused togethernow make no mistake all the chocolate here is delicious and of the highest quality but it just doesnt quite have the same level of attention to detail as im used to from hotel chocolat i would still be happy to receive this as a gift but it just didnt excite me in the way hotel chocolat products usually doid be more than happy to cope with the difficulties of cracking open an egg as generously thick as hotel chocolats dom so if you need any help just askaww now that is just too bad everything is all scratchdented and smushed the egg should be wrapped in its entirety and each chocolate inside should have its own protective compartment made of chocolate that would be exquisite of course some marking can be to blame due to shipping but stillits so much less appetizing this way looks like a last minute job to mehi dom ive just found your site and i loooovvvve it but i was wondering something im getting my sister a hotel chocolat egg for easter and i was just wondering what the best before dates are like do they say anywhere on the egg i hope this is not too cheeky to ask thank u lucylucy unfortunately i dont have the packaging any more unless youre planning on keeping the egg for years i would think youd be ok theres customer service contact details on the hc web site if youre really worriedaw thank you for replying i will take your word for it  think im just being overly cautious lucyi believe the best before date on my hc egg is may  more than adequate if you ask mei am always happy to see your email in my message box every dayi love your website daniellle score bars rocki have a question to all chocablog subscribers how did you find this websitei love chocolate daniellei googled brownie recipes and i found this and now i love it i loveee chocolate  danielllei googled for information on dark chocolate i think or googled for reviews on lindtoh thank you simon thats definetely adequate i thinkwell i ordered an egg on th for someone and the ordered was confirmed  i then decided to order again and made the mistale of not amending the delivery date  so used the online customer service section to amend my orderhowever i was refused this option as the egg was too big  yet my previous order no more than three minutes ago was accepted  so contacted them again to cancel the order  i also contacted them again on th to cancel my orderso imagine my surprise when it was delivered today th  woeful customer service whom i will be contacting again today for a full refund  why is it the bigger a company gets the more they are only interested in taking your money and shafting the customer
the proper name for this would be cadbury dairy milk with caramel egg but the whole dairy milk superbrand thing is really starting to annoy me now so im not going to play cadburys silly branding game as far as im concerned this is a caramel eggwith that out of the way as you can see i bought a  pack of eggs again purely in order to give you a well rounded review of courseas you can see from this photo eating a caramel egg can be a messy experience i dont recommend pausing to take photos unless you absolutely have to the caramel is thick and soft but seems to flow as though it has a life of its owncadburys caramel is one of the chocolates i buy fairly regularly but i dont think id consider buying it in egg form again  i would actually rate the mars egg above this onemy search for a creme egg killer will continuehow about trying the galaxy caramel egg given that you liked the bar shaped version id recommend the egg its caramel is vastly superior to the cadbury onei rather like the caramilk bar but find the caramel egg to be just too much however there is a mini version i got some from canada but they sell a version here in the us as well that seems to have better proportionsdont forget the rolo egg just to keep the caramel egg test aboveboard although i have to say i find all the caramel eggs a little overwhelming with the quantity of caramel and its not like you can have a rest between mouthfuls due to the caramel oozing out the splintering self destructing chocolate shell like a scene from terminator omg that picture makes it look sexualthat is a sexy picture im about all candy egged out after an indulgent weekend but i wouldnt turn down a cadbury caramel eggthese definitely dont compare to the creme eggs the creme eggs have a great flavor that adds to the flavor not to mention the color that greatly adds to the overall presentation and experience the few times ive had the caramel eggs i was disappointed as well for some reason the caramel in egg form is almost flavorless and does not really contribute much to the chocolate shell tsk tski absolutely love anything caramel i should hunt these down this yeardont have it it gave me a stomach ache and bad wind
first impressions as they say countwhen i had finished staring longingly at the box this is what greeted me insideeight beautifully finished little chocolates carefully packed in the chocolates all have a hand made look but its a good kind of hand made a lot of thought has obviously been put into the design and finish of these chocsthis particular box doesnt have a name on it but judging by the enclosed leaflet sucr do around  different chocolates and then group them together in different collections my little box containedhaving tasted each and every one i can safely say that the chocolatiers at sucr are the kind of people who like to experiment with flavours theres some really interesting and often slightly weird taste combinations going on here i found the blang white chocolate banana and rum a particularly strange onebut theres also some utterly divine flavours like the magnolia pecan  pralineit would also make them an excellent gift but probably not so much if you live outside the us what with the cost of international postage it is worth noting that sucr have a real physical store in new orleans so if youre in the area its definitely worth stopping bythey look like edible works of art dom  thank goodness that the us manufacturer had a chocolate called paris with some inviting ingredients and that it wasnt made after the other bury me in a yshaped coffin source blackadder ii paris that would surely have contained no other filling than hot air and a hole to see through to the other sideyou know i wouldnt have even associated paris with paris unless youd actually pointed outyour mind is a very strange thing
i have to admit to being a little surprised that green  blacks make easter eggs at all it just seems a little frivolous for what is normally such a serious chocolate brand something tells me they wouldnt have done this in their precadbury daysas you can see the packaging is decidedly average for a good quality chocolate egg a cheap card box with a cheaper plastic insert and some gold foil not the best startmy biggest disappointment was reserved for the contents of this egg though its  organic air no artificial flavours or colours no well anythingthe actual chocolate is just as tasty as it is in bar form if anything i think i prefer it slightly  because its a little thinner than the bars it melts in the mouth a little more quickly its smooth tasty and quite sweet for a dark chocolatebut looking at whats left of my egg my overwhelming feeling is one of disappointment green  black could have done something spectacular with their eggs but instead theyve apparently just chosen to make them as cheaply as they couldeaster eggs should be fun at the very least they should make you smile rather than stare blankly at them and say oh is that it i have so many childhood memories of incredibly disappointing easter eggs and i think id be getting that feeling again if i received this so i cant really recommend it if you like green  blacks youd be better off buying a couple of bars insteadso for  you get the green  blacks  bar repackaged into an egg with additional cardboard and gold foil pretty pathetic really have you seen the gb eggs they have too i saw them yesterday in asda in their little boxes for about the same price looked like an absolute ripoffi should have said actually the egg weighs g a bar of gbs  is g and costs  at tescoso basically youre paying a  premium for having it eggshaped i would imagine part of that is down to the packaging and part of it is down to the extra cost of transporting a significantly bigger boxso yeah its a rip off but i doubt cadbury are making a vast amount more on these than the barsyummy love chocolatesits good to discover the chocolates youve got therecrikey it makes you wonder why they bothered  just get the normal block and say its a flatpack egg from ikeaflat pack egg i love ithi therei find it interesting that you noted that it tastes quite sweet for dark chocolate i cant help but think that the cadbury effect has crept into the ingredients as well by including more sugarit would be interesting to see a precadburys wrapper vs a postcadburys wrapper to see if sugar might have moved up the pecking order somewhat
red tulip chocolates were founded in  but have since been acquired by cadbury schweppes  despite this they are still regarded fondly by most aussies and still considered to be a separate identity because we all have memories of just how delicious our red tulip easter bunnies tasted every yeari was interested to find out if the longheld belief that red tulip makes the best easter chocolate compared to cheaper brands was holding up  as such i found the classic elegant rabbit which has been in the same slightly daggy foil wrapping for my entire life  it literally rules the chocolate shelves in the months leading up to easter and is obviously the biggest seller as you can see from the photo i also tend to subscribe to the foolish notion that chocolate immediately followed by fruit grapes in this case implies that the goodness of the fruit has cancelled out any of the evils of the chocolate thus meaning that nothing has been eaten  my scales do not yet support this theorycheapie easter choccies come and go but heritage has been a brand associated with bargain buys for the past few years and seems to be a stayer in the market  i had one friend who disliked her supersized heritage egg so much that she left it in her room only to be discovered by her notsofussy alsatian a few hours later wired to the eyeballs and frothing at the mouth he left dozens of slimy brown vomits throughout the house before they could catch him and take him to the vet  unsurprisingly helens been a tad reluctant to try them againtime to compare the ingredients the evils of the chocolate no no no chocolate is not evil its not i tell you not not evili do agree with you however my thighs dontthe blame for your thighs can be given to cheese andor milk have you read the hip  thigh diet book it recommends removing dairy foods to see your hips and thighs shrink chocolate is all good theres no bad therei myself love red tulip elegant rabbbits and have been having those for easter every year since i was little and i still dont buy any other chocolate i look forward to easter every year when i can have a red tulip elegant rabbit because its an old favourite and they are so delicioushello elise  red tulip elegant rabbbits are crap and you taste like poop you little friendly spider wherre odanother year has passed and its red tulip time again  its nice to finally find some others who also love the very yummy elegant rabbits  i have tried the cadbury creme easter eggs which are okay but nothing beats the elegant rabbit  its not just the taste and texture its the emotional investment the childhood memories of fun and love at easter holiday time  i usually like to eat two rabbits in one sitting mmmmmi am an aussie living in the uk at the moment and have been searching the internet to see whether it would be possible to get a red tulip egg this year as i miss them the brits dont know what theyre missingdoes anyone know where you can buy red tulip chocolate outside of easter  maybe by the blockhi kara i am pretty sure red tulip only comes out at easter time cadbury actually makes them now unless you go to a cadbury factory i dont like your chances of getting them out of easter as far as i know the only other red tulip product that cadbury continued to make was the after dinner mintsgood afternoon red tulip vs heritage bunnies my brother and i have grown up on red tulip bunnies for decades now every year we would stockpile bunnies for months before easter and then see how long we could make them last for months after easter we once had  bunnies locked safely away in a cupboard in other years we had   and they would last for so long what made the red tulip bunnies so special was the flavour which we could find in no other chocolate ever throughout any other time of year when we would crack the bunnies open we would deeply inhale like darth vader having an asthma attackthe special smell of the red tulip bunnies and it would transport us directly to our earliest childhood memories much fun was also had trying to come up with new ways our bunnies would accidentally be demolished decapitated shattered stabbed shot plunge to their deaths alas this is no more because red tulip have changed their recipe what have they done the bunnies are now made of sickly sweet chocolate with too much sugar the chocolate in the old days used to be a refined nottoosweet nottoobitter chocolate that you could eat with out feeling sick not any more please red tulip cadbury bring back the old chocolate recipe and make your bunnies worth stockpiling again we have broken with decades of tradition and will not be buying red tulip bunnies to hoard this year until we are satisfied the recipe has reverted to the old red tulip classic bunny chocolatei was so sad the last  years as red tulip seem to have changed the recipe it almost tastes identical to eating a cadbury block now and they have gone so far backwards alsoi used to get  elegant bunnies as a kid every year id eat mine slowly and enjoy the rich cocoa burn at the back of the throat my brother and sister would scoff both down as soon as they got them  years ago i brought  bunnies and i ate  prior to easter to induldge a bit and this is when i found the recipe had changed i ended up giving all my other elegant bunnies away very disappointed im very unhappy with the new tastethis year i havent purchased any elegant bunnies with the fear they are wrecked foreverevery year id look forward to my elegant bunnies now its just a big hole that cant be filledi cant believe heritage won your taste test its foul and whats all this about red tulip changing their recipe stuff and nonsense its still as morish as ever and i buy so much it will always be separate from cadbury to me also red tulip humpty dumpty so good or maybe its just wa that still has it goodtotally agree lewis  i think heritage chocolate is not very nicei think heratige is better cause they do the nut free choclate so i think there amazing im almost  and last year i got my first easter egg helen and glenda red tulip after dinner mints were discontinued in   im not sure who made the decision or why  i will miss them toohello everyone i bought a red tulip bunny the other day just for old times sake and it appears they have gone back to their original recipe precadbury ownership the taste was just the way i remebered it in my childhood days thank you cadbury for resurecting red tulip bunny chocolate recipes int the spirit of the meaning of easterhi alljust opened a red tulip bunny it was crap tasted like cheap chocolate not sure what the go is however i read on web red tulip chocolate contained  cocoa solids a few years ago checked the bunny it only had  which is similar to heritage would be interested to know what else if anything has changed in the recipered tulip is of the shopping listsorry that isred tulip is off the shopping listill take itmy parents friends bert and klara upton started a chocolate factory in lane covesydney in about after moving at least twice it set up in mascot in sydneycan anyone confirm more detailsthey called it exquisite chocolates and sold red tulip brandkraft brought cadbury a few years ago and have fked up all the cadbury and red tulip lines i dont think cadbury is to blame over red tulip tasting that badplease kraft bring back the old red tulip elegant bunny recipe why tinker with something that worked so wellred tulip is the best you guys suck me flips a tablei agree that the red tulip elegant bunny doesnt taste the same as it used to i prefer the cadbury dairy milk bunny now i think and could be wrong that this is due to the uproar caused a yr or  ago when cadbury announced that it was reducing the amount of coco butter in the chocolate  replacing it with veggie oil us aussies united with a protest  they returned to the original recipe including the use of whole milkif you look at the ingredients on the back of the red tulip bunny you will see they dont use whole milk rather milk solids and there is a decent amount of veggie oil in it such a shame red tulip  cadbury used to be the essence of easter in australia  nzhello once again everyone another easter has passed and the red tulip bunnies were out there again i have to say that they did not quite get it right this year there is a hint of the old traditional flavour but it is not what it used to be i sampled many too many red tulip bunnies and some cadbury bunnies too there was definately a difference in the taste between the two lables but red tulip still was not quite as good as they used to be  they are still too sweet compared to the flavour of the olden days i remember cracking open a bunny and enjoying the smell of the chocolate but this year they were still too sweet probably to do with the cocoa content and milk vs milk solids please cadbury get it right for nest easter i continue to be ever hopeful that they go back to the traditional red tulip recipe i noticed all the supermarket chains had their own brands on the shelves too i did not even try those  the dominance of the home brands which is cutting suppliers out of the chain is getting worse  but that is a whole other story ri ate cadbury and red tulip bunnies this easter and there is no doubt cadbury is much better i used to love elegant rabbits but they are not as good as they werei used to show off to overseas visitors about the perfect balance achieved in the red tulip easter egg but the magic has definatly left the recipe behind it does not even stack up to a family block of cadburys these days but it used to be in a completely different league  i buy one out of habit and reminisce about how it used to taste i used to buy about  of them you literally have to wash the taste out of your mouth these days when you used to just want to eat another onewoolworths and coles do not apear to be selling the red tulip elegant rabbit this year  i cannot find it on their websites or on cadburys website or in the shops  has anyone else spotted them and which shops are selling them   thank youtheyre at coles at least in western australia im sure theyre in woolworths too other red tulip bunnies are sold at iga i still love red tulip as much as i did when i last commented here  years agohi lewis thank you for your speedy reply  last time i was in perth was   i will continue investigating the canberra storesi called cadbury and was advised that the red tulip elegant rabbit is available at coles  so i went to my local coles again and there they were row upon row of elegance  very happy now  i just hope they taste nice hahahahi gerry did you sell red tulip chocolates to retailers or to the public  just being nosey here  at easter my mother would only buy red tulip nothing else was good enough  and this year i cannot find anywhere that sells the elegant rabbit  theres a working rabbit but i want my elegantsign the petition on

ridiculousred tulip chocolate is disgusting now cadbury you should be ashamed of yourselvesthis thread is a sad telling of a sad tale one again this year they seem to have just made red tulip worse

for more than  years but no the downward spiral continuesi normally eat easter eggs from the time they come out afer christmasthis year ive been very restrained and waited until now to purchase my

easter is approaching and that can only mean one thing egg and rabbit shaped chocolate confections and of course its our duty to eat as many as we can and tell you all about themmars eggs are available individually but in order to er write a thorough review i bought a pack of three coughinstead heres a nice photo of the offspring which i cut in two with a knifeas you can see each egg is really just an egg shaped mini mars bar inside the milk chocolate shell we have a layer of caramel and a layer of soft malty nougat except the packaging here calls it truffle for some reason im not sure if its actually different from the  fluffy nougat layer in a proper mars bar or if calling it truffle is just some kind of marketing  experiment but it tastes the same to meoverall the egg is very sweet and quite sticky  but given this is a direct competitor to the creme egg we can hardly complain about that the odd thing for me was that the first bite tasted exactly like a creme egg to me i think thats just a case of my senses being confused by an egg thats almost exactly the same size and texture as cadburys offering but i suspect its partly due to both offerings being mostly sugaras someone who will by the occasional creme egg i liked this but im not entirely convinced given the choice of the two on the sweet shop shelf id almost certainly go for the creme egg but if i were buying a selection of chocolate eggs id definitely pick up one of theseits not a creme egg killer but its still pretty goodhow nice of you to write thatand thanks to googles randomity i wound up on it just now when my dad brought a few of those home with him the creme is supposed to be like sticky liquid rightwell when i took a bite of mine i expected there to be some kind of liquid but thanks to how long this shop in iceland keeps its stocks in and the hot temperatures they keep stuff at the liquid was ineviteably gone hardishy but still melted in my mouthand the egg itself tasted wonderfully oh and yeah thanks for writing the review p it was quite tasty and delicious and so was the egg 
having done my research my hopes werent particularly high for this while there are some fantastic small american chocolatiers my experience of chocolate from larger manufacturers hasnt been great so farbut as it turns out i quite enjoyed themas you can see nutty bars are very simple wafer bars the layers of wafer are separated by a sweet peanut butter and the bar is coated in a very thin layer of milk chocolate in fact the chocolate is so thin that you can actually melt it just by looking at it i had to put a few bars in the fridge for half an hour in order to get a decent photo but even so the chocolate melted again the moment i picked it upbut for normal eating purposes ie ones that dont involve getting decent photos first this probably wont be an issue each of the  bars in a box comes individually wrapped and you can just hold it by the wrapper when eating itwhen you bite into a bar the first thing you notice is just how light and crispy it is im not surprised each bar only has  calories  its mostly air but thats a good thing because the result is something thats tasty and satisfying without being stodgy and fillingtastewise theyre quite sweet and have a pleasant nutty taste the chocolate is so thin that you can barely taste it but that doesnt really matter this is definitely a less is more snackwith all the fantastic chocolates ive tasted recently i really shouldnt have enjoyed these quite as much as i did but at  a box that works out at about p each i would definitely be buying these for midmorning snacks theyre simple sweet light and tastyluckily they sent me three boxes nutty bars have been with me for many years and theres no decline in the effect they have on me and there never will be ive had boxes of them stacked on my bookshelf always there for me to munch to my hearts content many times have i eaten a whole box in one sitting ive given away thousands of them turned many on to them ive pigged out on them ive savored them id get a little debbie tatto seriously nutty bars are in that erotic sensual class like andes mint chocolateslittle debbie is as you related in the article an institution in america  i just tried these singles and i should inform you that you are really missing out on the real original nutty bar  the original is a  layer wafer while this single is only  layers they cut out  layer to get the bar to  calories  you wouldnt think it would impact it that much but i think the impact is substantial  also the original bar has a slightly thicker dose of chocolate dont worry it still melts onto your fingers getting it off is half the fun  the swiss cake roles are also the best in class much better than the hostess hohoswiss cake rolls are my favorite and ive been eating them for well over  years  little debbie does not use animal fat which ensures no weird aftertaste like hostess products  slightly chilled is the only way to eat nutty bars and swiss cake rolls  the original nutty bars with the extra layer of cookie and packed in double packs are definitely worth it im planning to go on a tour of the factory in early julydont know if this will be read or not given how long ago the post started but i had to add my  cents worth about little debs i havent had them in a long time only because i have a hard time stopping once i stop eating themmy fave way to eat them is to deftly loosen and bite off the top layer then munch till its gone each layer follows in kind until ive devoured the entire delicacy theres just no better way to eat them oh yes the trick in managing the chocolate peanut buttery mess on ones fingers it to eat as many in succession as possible more eating and less lickingoopsmeant to say i have a hard time stopping once i start eating them oi have to do research on nutty bars and other sweets for school but you people are useless i need the year they were first made and other names for them and stuff like that make a website with useful informationjenetta i think you need to do some research on the definition of research im so sorry youre going to fail at schoolthese nutty bars were even a favorite of our rd president mr bush and dick cheney would probably indulge in a late night snack of them in the situation room while discussing bombing plans for iraqhttpwwwflickrcomphotospaypaul
when i opened the package and saw this box of chocolates i realised that hotel chocolat dont just employ master chocolatiers  they also have some pretty talented packaging designersi was tempted to shoot half a dozen photos of the box and leave it at that but when i began tasting some of the fifteen chocolates offered here i knew i had to write moreas usual hotel chocolats cunning chocolatiers have managed to come up with some quite remarkable creations includingpave de montelimarin which pistachios almonds and sour cherry pieces sit in a bed of white chocolate each releasing their distinctive flavours onto the palate as the dark chocolate base joins in to give a superb bittersweet  mouthwatering finishrhubarb grenachesomewhat thicker than it appears on the menu and a first for me a soft rhubarbwhite chocolate combination in which the tartness of the rhubarb cuts the sweetness of the white chocolate in a stunning partnership beautifully balanced tartsweet flavours dance over the tongue as you allow it to melt awaybaltic trufflethis time redcurrants are used to balance the sweetness of a white chocolate shell held in a milk chocolate ganache of unbelievable lightnessstrawberries  creammore white chocolate but enclosing a ganache bursting with natural strawberry a real taste of summermelon martinimore chocolate alchemy melon with a slight alcoholic kick swathed in delicious milk chocolate wonderful fruit flavours given an unusual and subtly blended alcohol twistfruit  nutcadbury never made anything like this combination of hcs wonderfully plump sultanas mixed with puffed rice and bound in a hazelnut praline the final mouthful of juicy fruity sultanas is a delight to the tastebuds and thats less than half of whats on offer in this truly remarkable box theres more blackcurrant truffles something hc do so well and a couple of mini slabs one of which contains a warming dash of essential oil of gingeri loved the packaging before i tasted the chocolates and it would have been a terrible disappointment to discover anything other than a fabulous selection of unusual flavours and remakes of classic tastes but of course this is hotel chocolat and once again they have proven themselves to be innovative daring and totally upmarket this is a box that rocks and if you love your chocs or want to seriously impress someone then i have no hesitation in recommending this to you it is a triumph of both design and contentok now its my turn to be jealoushaha i reviewed this today and was equally impressed by both the design and the execution plus it was free thats always a bonusif only my site was as good as both chocablog and terrys then i would get free stuff thatlooks as good as this too    damn you experienced choclatiers ppackaging as sweet as the choclates dthat melon sounds like a great summer seller toobought on yours and terrys recommendation and a total hit soooo goooooood 
further proof of two thingsim no expert on liqueur making but im willing to bet that if this is how lindt have done it its the way it has to be done so essentially we have a very sweet chocolate with a small hit of alcohol  not enough to make it into a great taste experience in my opinion its rather unusual to find myself writing this but on this occasion i cant help but think that this is fairly unremarkable chocolate making im sure that in the eu this bar isnt terribly expensive but im certain that were it to be imported into the uk it would be and as such i wouldnt recommend it unless you happen to be in germany or france and snap it up for a few eurossimon was this refridgerated or forzen at any point because when ive stored lindt bars of this blister format before in the cold and i found that a sugar crust forms on the inside there that not normally there when the bar is stored at room temp ive had that happen to my raspberry bars before so maybe its not an manufacturer issue but a storage one just a thought no i stored it in a cool but not cold cupboard of course it did have a trip in the cargo hold of an aeroplane which may account for itive noticed the same thing on these lindt bars  i presumed it was deliberate and done to keep the very liquid centre and chocolate from forming a big mushi want to buy this chocalate but i live in istanbul and i dont know where buying you can help me
lately ive been amazed at the rate it which lindt have been able to churn out new and interesting products their range seems to be growing on a daily basis even my little local corner shop has a whole shelf full of lindt now although i suspect thats primarily aimed at me because i just keep buying the stuff while ive pretty much universally liked all the new additions to the range i am a little concerned that the chocolatiers at lindt are spreading themselves a little thin now i really like kinder its very sweet but its just so creamy and moreish the lindt bar shares that sweetness but it just seems to be missing a certain something the filling isnt quite as soft and creamy as it could be and its just a little sweeter than it need bei dont have any kinder chocolate to hand so i couldnt say if this is actually sweeter but it seems like it to me on the other hand that could just be down to the fact that this is a much bigger bar with the tiny kinder bars you dont get much so youre forced to eat it more slowlyhaving said all that i do like this bar its just too sweet for me to scoff down in one sitting like my instinct tells me i shouldand that annoys me somewhatuhm deja vu i feel like this has been reviewed already and now i will have to find the chocolate in the supermarketyeah hasnt it been reviewed beforeits not a new addition im pretty sure but i love it  being slightly less expensive than the excellence range but oooooooooooooooooooo yeaaaaaaaaaaah is what i say to this bar its the sort of nice thing you want to scoff but the sweetness says oh no you dont sir devour me slowly pleasesimon reviewed it yeah obviously all that sugar is affecting my ability to remember and to go back and check the archives no matter its a good bar and lindt justifies multiple reviews d
howeveri looked at the ingredients before opening it upover  of this expensive premium branded drinking chocolate is sugar yes thats right i have paid over  for g of sugari felt like id been mugged if i could return it i wouldso beware good reader not all hot chocolate is actually chocolate and charging us a fortune for a fancy container with a load of sugar in it is an affront and an offence avoid this sugary rubbishend of rantso how did it actually tasteyes how did it actuallly tastesimon hasnt told us how it tastes  so let me do that nowthe ginger and the chilli hot chocolate and the mint chocolate tastes like very sweet hot chocolate theres a tiny hint of the flavouring making you think that if you keep sipping it will develop into something with a bit more bite  but it doesnt ill stick to whittards coffee in future
more christmas chocs still here this time a little gold carboard pouch with a slightly pretentious name and while the packaging is cute whats inside is a little less impressivewhat you see above is the entire contents of the box five chocolates or an irresistible selection of gorgeous chocolates according to the packagingthe varieties areand while theyre tasty enough i wouldnt go so far as to call them gorgeous i wouldnt have been able to tell you what flavour they were meant to be without looking at the helpful key on the back of the box theyre all exactly the same size and shape theyre slightly different shades of brown and white and subtly different textures but theyre all just too sweet to be moreishaside from a stocking filler at christmas i genuinely have no idea who this  chocolate box is aimed at the actual chocolates are ok despite being mainly sugar but i really cant think of a single reason id go out and buy a box of  run of the mill chocolatesthats definitely a possibility yes 
venturing over to the pause for effect dark side can be a little bit scary  when you see blocks and bars stating that they have a minimum cocoa content of    and  it can seem a bit like a chocochallenge of strength and fortitude instead of the fun and frivolous activity it really should bea great deal of the standard milk chocolate weve all inhaled since childhood often only contains around  cocoa solids and is instead wellpadded out with milk or the everintriguing milk solids butter oils and sugar  it is sweet and melts quicklyin order to ease yourself over to the dark side lindt have some assorted squares available to try that range from very milky around  to the salivasucking bitterness of  cocoa contentthe best way to start immersing yourself into the joys of dark chocolate is to buy a pack of the  cocoa content squares from lindt  this allows you to enjoy a few small tastes of serious dark chocolate rather than wasting an entire block  ive found from bitter experience boom boom that sinking my teeth into an entire solid row of intense dark is about as confronting as pete doherty a week before bath time and just as unpalatable  instead these squares are big enough for a taste and small enough to counteract the bitterness of the first bite  on opening my particular packet however it was obvious from their whiteness that theyd melted and reset again bloody australian weather and boiling hot cars carrying the groceries home  whilst this does detract from their attractiveness it doesnt stop me from eating them and nor should it stop you  unless they are way waaaay past their best before date eat up and enjoy  after all beauty is in the eye of the beholder or chocolate holder in our caseeach square is only a few grams of chocolate each and just the right amount to chew suck nibble and taste  wash it down with a hot cup of black tea or strong coffee so that it helps the actual taste of the chocolate come forward  you may still need something sweeter i normally do for every day eating but it is still nice to throw off the conventional shackles of  or less and get down and dirty with devilish delights of the delicious dark side i would like to comment on a really dark chocolate i got for valentines daythe company was chocolate chocolate chocolate company wwwchocolatechocolatecom and i got a small bag of blueberries covered in dark chocolate  cocoa  i have had the  bar before and thought it was terriblesooo bitter and dry but these blueberries i got from ccc was much sweeter and smootheri cant believe it had more cocoa then lindt and taste betteri only eat chocolate  or above and i find this one to be a good normal quality chocolate lindt makes a superior product  ecuador variety which imparts a creamier consistency and sweeter taste  you must try this flavor i enjoy it with a large glass of cafe au lait or melt a few ounces into a jar of peanut butter for an incredibly creamy and healthy spreadyall should be aware that lindt recently changed the recipe in the us for its excellence  bars to make them smooth and creamy in other words bland sweet no snap no finish no dark chocolate character mourn for the us chocolate lovers
late last year one of my small chocolateloving people had a school trip to germany and so i handed over  and said bring me back something unusual and make sure its chocolate well sure enough my faith was rewarded and this was one of the bars i was givenwhen i popped the first square of this chocolate into my mouth the sweetness of the elderflower was almost immediately released causing my salival glands to go into overdrivethis is seriously mouthwatering stuff the initial sweet hit of the elderflower is soon tempered by the chocolate melting and as the flavours combine you get a wonderful citrussychocolate mouthful with hints of lychee and lemon this really is quite remarkable chocolate but unfortunately leysieffers site is entirely in german and as far as i can tell they dont distribute to the uk which is a huge shame i think this has to be one of the tastiest bars of chocolate i have eaten of late its a little sweet for everyday consumption but as a special treat it really is worth tracking downits at times like this i wish chocablog had some sort of tastesmell interface as i would love to share this one with our readers its that goodi would like to know if any other chocolate companies make an elderflower variety and if not then might i suggest that someone in the uk gives it a go very soonhello im from germany if you dont find any other company in the uk leysieffer ship worldwide they charge   to the ukdid you ever find any uk versions i tasted some elderflower chocolate that a friend had bought from the cafe at the national gallery in london the other day it was absolutely delicious i didnt get the brand name unfortunately but if youre in london it might be worth a tripyou have made me long for crab apple jelly i made it every year when i lived around the conerr from a crab apple tree but since i moved back to melbourne i have been without i will have to start some serious searching
every now and then a freebie arrives  this time via an apology from our grocery delivery service but more often its a kris kringle or unexpected gift  and i realise just what a chocosnob ive becomenewmans have been around for years but have never troubled my taste buds or wallet and have never visited either my fridge or pantry  perhaps the picture explains why  yes weve all been told not to judge a book by its cover but when the supermarket shelves are groaning with established and credible brands such as cadbury nestl and lindt anything ordinary or significantly cheaper is likely to be ignored or treated with suspicioni suspect that his has happened with newmans  my guess is that grannies and folk on strict budgets often purchase them as gifts because of the price and packaging alone and they then disappear into the dodgy darkness of appliance cupboards or are willingly donated to end of year christmas fundraising hampers  to my chagrin ive now discovered what a shame that is  i hope that newmans do too  their current packaging isnt doing them any favours  if they can be bothered wrapping up each six gram mint chocolate individually they can do a bit more work in improving the outside packaging insteaddespite their plain appearance these dark chocolates filled with a runny peppermint fondant are actually very good  the pack tells me that the chocolate has a minimum of  cocoa solids and none of the other  ingredients even remotely point to cheap tacky or  dare i say this compounded confectionary in the slightesthubby love chunks isnt a huge peppermint fan but always the giver he was bravely prepared to have at least one taste  this led to several more of the packets being torn open and consumed as we sat on the lounge watching scrubs after dinner  mmmm these are quite nice he murmured in surprise are they newno just stuck in uninspired packaging and therefore doomed to be unseen by most selfconfessed aussie chocosnobs including myself  my efforts in trying to find out more about this melbournebased manufacturer were in vain also  no website and no mentionsinpassing in any foodie or choccieslanted articles about melbourne  perhaps newmans nearinvisibility is intentional kind of like wonder womans aeroplanethis foray into no frills chocolate choices has made me a bit more prepared to step out of the snobsphere and try other brands that are prepared to list their cocoa content  especially if theyre freewe have had a beautiful time the ennvmonreit is relaxing quiet and we wanted for nothing  we enjoyed our walks to to the wineries and into town and have had a thoroughly perfect experience  we have been talking about coming back with our husbands  thank you very much  it was only a short stay but wonderful
suffice to say this is worth waiting for its a simple idea but one which works very well  small g taster bars of green  blacks chocolate with two bars of each six varieties  dark  milkthe varieties areoverall a really nice little collection of chocolate that allows you to sample a large part of the green  blacks range without investing in a big bar that you might not like i particularly like the fact that you get two of each flavour so you can sample them with a friend or have two of the ones you like and just give the others awaydefinitely worth seeking outnice to see you 
the last of the filthy food companys kind offerings and this time they contain a blend of caramel and fresh cream  or as they would have it shamelessly rich caramel whipped into double creamso there we have it  a split decision i would happily recommend half of the range but i would also steer prospective buyers away from the other half of the range still its early days for filthy and if they can produce more of the yummy stuff then i can see them carving themselves a niche in the afterdinner special treat marketfootnote i was in my local sainsburys the other day and i noticed that they are offering the entire filthy foods range at  off a good time to try themi have to disagree  the kinky crme brle bites are like little drops of delicious caramel flavoured cloud a much lighter option than the chocolate bites which means you can eat morehii luuuuurve all the filthy bites  what a refreshing change and perfect for dinner parties  dont bother with puddings just get a few boxes of these and the conversation turns interesting  all my friends devoured them in secondsmy favourites are strawberry and chocolate but others prefferd the kinky brule and caramel optionsi want more flavours asapnathana few boxes of chocolates makes the conversation interesting i dont know what they put in yours then
swiss glory is not a isolated nudist outpost but a wellrespected chocolate manufacturer that has been operating in south australia since   it is perhaps not surprisingly run by swiss immigrants who are extremely skilled at chocolate makingthey regularly win the champion chocolate award at state and national royal shows and yet remain the secondcousin to adelaides most famous chocolatier haighs  reasons for their blist status is unclear but it might have something to do with their location in the buttugly industrial sector of stepney compared to the heritagelisted inner city beehive corner building owned by haighs total silence on the advertising front or the were just getting on with things and not sticking our noses into other areas attitude that the swiss are known for in fact they dont even have their own websitewhatever they make sensational chocolate  it is with a great deal of trepidation that i make the following statement swiss glorys plain milk chocolate bar is the closest reminder to lindts that i have ever tasted  truly  it has a very creamy consistency that easily dissolves on the tongue providing the classic good mouth feel expected and delivered by lindt  on the negative side having three fingers molded in a generic barshape wrapped up in plastic with no ingredients listed on the back doesnt make it the most attractive option for giftgiving   swiss glorys dark chocolate also refuses to divulge any ingredients or cocoamass on the back of the wrapping  my guess is that its around  and can be placed in lindts dark blue lindor ball category  very very nice and definitely needs a more respectful packaging to give it the respect such top quality chocolate deservesluckily for me swiss glory had some special selection handmade truffles on sale in again a plastic bag  never one to judge by appearance especially where bargainbutgood chocolate is concerned i rushed home and eagerly shared them with my husband love chunkshonestly i tried my best to still my excitedlyfidgeting hands long enough to slice some truffles down the middle and photograph them but this picture does them about as much justice as paris hilton to humanitarian causesthese modest little lumps were a real find  the dark chocolate heart literally sang to us with its filling of a deliciously delicate honey crme  thank goodness there were two in the bag  the dark barrel was filled with a wellcrafted rum filling that wasnt over powering but perfectly complemented the chocolate the white truffle was a buttery creamy ball of hazelnut ganache gorgeousness and the liqueur milk truffle with real cherry pieces was a delightful surprise  the whitechocolate dusted truffle was filled with a milk chocolate and coffee mixture that worked surprisingly well for this lover of darkchocncoffee combos and the dark truffle with even darker filling was sublimethe milk chocolate truffle was the only disappointment with a significant sugar crackle between the chocolate coating and inside  perhaps a hint as to why they were on sale in the first place  the best before date was rapidly approaching  who cares  ill be a much more frequent visitor to the swiss glory counter in futurethe dark chocolate heart literally sang to youthe dark chocolate heart literally sang to youtruely a multisensual experiencewhere do you find theseyep they sang  a rare but beautiful experience  theyre available in australia and maybe switzerland seeing as the makers are originally from thereyou shared swiss glory shared oh i dont believe it have you tried their sacher torte great with coffeeoh and theres a swiss glory outlet under the same roof as the central market block its in the victoria square arcadei used to stop there every saturday for our weekly fix of their vanilla slicesyum yum yum i know im late to this party but swiss glory has traditionally been the choclatier of choice for generations of my adelaide family my grandparents sent some truffles over to the uk with my parents for my birthday truly gorgeous and they do package some things right  mum always gets a trufflestuffed half milk chocolate egg from granddad at easter oh and they do something rather marvelous with liquored apricots covered in dark chocolatei think theres a small swiss glory in burnside village tootheir ivory truffles are to die for  i travel from tas back to my home town specifically to stock up
all of the filthy foods range come in these very well made fold out boxes and the chocolates are nested inside a sellophane wrapper looking for all the world like a nest of pyramidshaped chocolate eggs as you can see the insides of the boxes are colourcoordinated full marks for presentationthe chocolates themselves are restrained in the usual thick hard  belgian milk chocolate shell and the cream filling has been whipped with lashings of double cream very carry on spanking matron now i have a personal hatred of anything that is artificially strawberry flavoured so i was pleased to see that these are filled with the real deal strawberries and cream  not particularly avante garde i have to say but a timeless classic is a timeless classic after all and these carry it off well theres plenty of fruity strawberry flavour in each bite and of course the cream works splendidly with the strawberries as it has done for many a yeartheyre a good deal lighter on the palate than the dark choc bites and as such they were destined to have a short but happy existence chez michalak we hoovered these up in one sitting and the general consensus was that they were very moreishwhere the dark choc bites were very much an grown up after dinner cupofcoffee kind of treat these little fellers have universal appeal although at p per bite youre probably unlikely to want to turn your kids loose on a box strawberries and donkeys and all that if your tastes dont extend too far into the dark side then give these a gothe filling does not look much like strawberries to me but if you say it tastes goodfilthy food has a great selection of chocolate  would highly recommend them to anyone
firstly i want to say that american fudge and english fudge are a bit different generally speaking american fudge is a little smoother a bit more moist and dense making it heavier whereas english fudge is usually a bit drier and more crumbly they are both delicious just differentamerican fudge is more likely to come in weird and wonderful flavours but being chocablog were just interested in the chocolate varietieswhat we have here is three flavours chocolate chocolate peanut butter and chocolate walnutim pleased to report that they are all delicious theyre smooth sweet and properly chocolatey and despite being quite heavy they melt in the mouth beautifully theyre all very sweet but youre not going to eat these in one sitting just break off a small piece to nibble on with your morning coffee yummy favourite of the three varieties is definitely the chocolate walnut the nuts are light and crispy and really add to the texture and flavour of the fudge i wasnt so keen on the peanut butter variety and found it just a bit too sweet and peanutty for my tastes the plain chocolate variety comes somewhere between the twodespite the fact that im convinced you could get diabetes just by looking at these gorgeous fudges i highly recommend them the cost of shipping may not make them practical if youre outside the us but shipping costs aside these go straight onto my recommended listhere in adelaide suburb norwood we have a shop called chocolate on parade which makes a yummy cappucino fudgep per bite that makes this box almost a fiver guess i wont be reviewing these anytime soon unless they send me some samples tooand i just posted this in the wrong section great
the peepster box is a novel way of packaging  a set of four slabs in effect if you choose to go the peepster route then the contents are your choicethe milk chocolate praline fusion slab is a combination of milk and white chocolate and hazelnut praline the addition of he white chocolate gives it a slightly sweet flavour and the overall blend has the most incredibly soft feel in the mouth its almost bordering on melting in the packet and as soon as you pop a piece in your mouth its melting away the combination of praline and the two chocolates is lovely and creamy if a little on the sweet and rich side dont overdo itmy overall impression of this selection is that it tends to err on the side of the softer sweeter tastes  not something i have come to associate hotel chocolat with but having said that they do carry it off very well as one might expect from a premium brand if you love your milk and white chocolate and occasionally visit the dark side then id say this was an excellent selection its certainly another great way of exploring hotel chocolats increasingly diverse range of bars and slabs and as ever its tastefully packaged an excellent gift for your chocolate lovercomments are closed
in case you were wondering this ones italianperugina are owned by nestl italia but dont let that put you off this is proper dark chocolate  a gift from a friend who recently took a long weekend in italyflorence i believe the city i mean my friend was not in the magic roundabout as far as i knowbut i digressi didnt really know what to expect when i opened the box i dont speak italian and the illustration on the box doesnt give a lot away but i was pleasantly surprisedthe box contains  small slabs of rich dark glossy chocolate a few had been broken on the journey back from italy but that didnt spoil my enjoyment in any wayeach slab is about mm thick and roughly the same shape size and shape as a credit card indeed these would probably make quite an acceptable form of currency they just look and feel like a quality product break one in half and it snaps with a satisfying thunkpersonally i dont mind that  the chocolateyness alone carries iti think these would be the perfect accompaniment to a nice cup of coffee or even better break a couple into a bowl of vanilla ice cream in the summer theyre pretty good on their own just to nibble on but theyre not a stuff your face kind of chocolategreat for sharing with friends over coffee or ice cream but youd have to find it first and i dont think its quite worth a trip to italycomments are closed
id never heard of it and was duly intrigued  a visit to bracegirdles specialty chocolate caf saw me pay  for a ml bottle of a liquid that resembled cocacola and ill have you know that i saw a  cocoa content bar there that i might get up the courage to try another day  i also sought out a childhood favourite a packet of allens chicos because the caller reckoned that chocolade tasted a bit like themfirstly the chicosthe only way i can describe them especially if we ignore the particularly cringeworthy design of the packaging is that they are the consistently of jelly babies or in the uks case wine gum but with a rather pleasant chocolate flavour  yes the first ingredient is sugar  cunningly disguised as glucose syrup and then followed by sugar but they also have full cream milk powder and cocoa in them as well  they are exceptionally soft and designed so that it is impossible to stick to one  or even one handfulso did the chocolade stack up to the chicos  yes and no  the design of the bottle is rather elegant presumably to help me get over paying  for ml  this seems very steep especially when like all other carbonated drinks at a quarter of the price its main ingredient is water sugar flavours and food acid  also the girl who served me in the shop said that they dont sell too many of them as customers are a bit freaked out by drinking cold fizzy chocolate  theyd rather have a chocolate milk or hot drink with their cakes truffles and fondues  fair enoughchocolade did remind me of chicos but as a liquid it was more a weird experience than a pleasant one  after giving my eight year old a few sips to try she declared it delicious which is odd considering that she loathes chicos  my husband love chunks on the other hand hated it  bleuuggh it might as well be frangelico mixed with tonic water he gasped spitting it down the sink and washing his mouth out with water  needless to say he had a big night on the grape water a few years ago the good times ended when the bottle of frangelico was brought out from the back of the drinks cabinet  he then spent the next day clutching the white porcelain phone to god and has disliked the liqueur ever sincetherefore i would describe chocolade as a curiosity to try the once rather than a new drink sensation that will force us all to give coke hot chocolate and iced coffee the big elbow foreveroh well done tracking these down i have to say im tempted by the chocolade despite the mixed reviews of your family it just looks nicethanks dom  anything for chocablog
one of the things i love most about the internet is that it lets you discover the most interesting people and places that youd never otherwise know about and it also lets them discover youa week later and a rather large heavy box arrives at my door inside the box two smaller boxes one with  large slices of fudge review coming soon and one with these  trufflesas you can see they look rather good theyre all different but all chocolatey and im not sure this picture conveys how big these are but unless you have a very large mouth theres no way youll eat one of these in a single mouthful however much you might want tothese truffles are all very soft very smooth moist sticky and utterly delicious theyre like the soft centres from expensive chocolates without the chocolate shell instead each one has been gently rolled in cocoa powder or coconut despite this they are still quite messy but a lot of fun to eat i dont think its possible to eat them without getting a sticky face sticky fingers or sticky everythingwow those look amazing im very tempted to have a little word with them and see if i cant get myself some samples im a huge fudge fan and have been wanting to try some different varieties for awhile now peanut butter and maple  pecan in particularfudge from central wisconsin on up is mandatory they claimed to have invented the stuff on mackinac islandthey may have invented american fudge but thats quite different from british fudge although the two are equally good imoill look at some of the differences when i get around to my main review but i have several pounds of american fudge to eat first well i just had my first taste of macinac island fudge got it as a gift though id grown up in wisconsin and never had it  it was astounding  im not usually a fudge person and two of the three slices in the box had nuts no thanks but the third was i think the maple fudge  it completely changed my opinion on what fudge could be  its firm adn easy to cut but as soon as i pop a bite into my mouth it begins to melt into the smoothest tasting liquid chocolate delisciousness  i just received the truffles from their shop they were bitesize and not hardly as big as the photo and writeup depicts but they were most likely the best truffles i ever had they were superb and tasted amazing
the milk chocolate has been covered in previous reviews so i wont go into too much detail about it its creamy milky with good cocoa flavours and it isnt overly sweet in short its the sort of high quality product youd associate with the lindt nameno what concerns us or rather what concerned me was the filling the fact i like pistachios made this bar an oddson favourite for a good review anyway but the fondant cream that surrounded the nut sealed the deal for methe nuts are perfectly preserved  still crisp and full of flavour  and the fondant cream is amazingly smooth and melts away like a spring mist filling your mouth with a creamy slightly sweet nutty flavour which combines beautifully with the milk chocolate my personal preference is to save the nut for last letting the sweet stuff melt away before attacking the pistachio on its own as previously mentioned the nuts are always crisp and fresh tasting as one would expect from a premium brandof course being milk chocolate and having this fondant filling means that lindt pistachio does tend to be on the slightly sweet side but thats hardly cause for concern this is a great addition to the already massive lindt range and well worth seeking outa personal favourite but very very difficult to track downi happen to try this earlier and i can say its pretty enjoyable with a cup of hot coffee the sweetness is very light the creaminess of the pistachio ganache and the whole pistachio nut were very interesting yet not powering over the chocolate i searched the net forother people that might agree with me on this nice review by the wayalthough ive sampled most of the lindt bars the pistachio flavour  one i still havent tried i mustnt let it feel left out for too much longer
hotel chocolat have always been experts at packaging and this is no exception in fact the packaging for the product is so good this review is going to be a little different its mainly photosimpressive isnt it its risqu yet elegant and beautifully produced and im happy to say the chocolate is just as good as it looks the four beginner curious daring and hardcore packages each contain two slabs of increasingly dark chocolate ranging from white  fruity to  ghanian chocolate in the hardcore package the mouth box contains some utterly divine champagne truffles deliciously soft and smooth without being overly alcoholic and the eyes box contains a blindfold how wonderfully bizarrei absolutely guarantee that you will not regret itdid you just get sent this i got sent a peepster box from them instead that contained  of the same chocolate not that im complaining mind butthis sorta puts it to shamealmost speechless with jealousy whilst typing this  dom you are sooooooo lucky
the first thing i want to mention is the packaging as you can see it looks pretty much the same as the strawberry and paprika bar and has a similar inane rant on the back of the boxaside from the fact that it simply doesnt make sense giving up chocolate for lent is easy in a chocolate factory i dont find hearing about the disgusting mess that claire keeps under her mac particularly conducive to me enjoying a nice bar of chocolate if it were funny then it might be acceptable but its not its just the kind of pointless unfunny story that drunk people share at the office party the couple of paragraphs that actually mention the chocolate dont do so in an informative  or even seductive  way either it reads like its been written by a marketing student who has been taught to use every clich in the book then theres the linethere is little we can say to help the uninitiated with some of the unique and some may say challenging combinationswhich roughly translated means if you dont like this its not our fault youre just uneducated and not good enough to appreciate it yeah rightby the time i actually opened the box i simply wasnt interested any more maybe its just me maybe im overly critical but it cant be a good signupon opening the plastic wrapper yeah plastic packaging on organic chocolate you are greeted with the rather pleasant aroma of orange oil maybe things are looking upi dont know what it is about montezumas maybe its the quality of the ingredients maybe theyre just really bad at making chocolate  but ive not been even remotely impressed by either of the bars ive tried so far and i wont be seeking them out againi cant stop laughing at the fact that you also picked up on the rant on the back of the box when i reviewed a bunch of montezumas stuff i also questioned just what on earth their motives were with all of that gibberish on the back and again with the unitiated line i basically thought yeahthanks for the help fellas anyway in complete agreement here methinks you should take a look at their site and see what they charge for their bars ho boy am i glad i got a bunch for freeim amazed you actually managed to write an analysis of this bar without it deteriorating into a rant thats more than i managed awesome review nothing like bad chocolate getting its proper dues at least you got your chocolate even if it disappointed we ordered  of chocolate mail order from them and it never arrived they claim it was delivered but we never had a note through the door and its not where they claim it was leftim happy to say that montezuma will be sending more chocolate their reputation is intact in my eyesi dont know you spend a weeks wages on a belated christmas present for your brother and he publicly trashes it psi didnt realise you still drank dish watertheir chocolate is a bit hit and miss i find  i personally really like their chilli lime and tequila trufflesthe back of the box is highly irritating although i think youll find that the giving up chocolate for lent being easy in a chocolate factory comment is sarcasm rather than nonsensewell ive got more montezumas stuff coming up for review soon i promise to review it with an open mindi sampled this in chichester it made me feel giddy and constipated and my boyfriend feared for my physical and mental health i have since been diagnosed with cajun squirrel disorder or csd as its more widely known the doctors rate my chances at  please send any donations to my publicist max clifford much lovejust come across your blog  some cool stuff here but i find some of these comments  odd  i love this bar and a lot of their other stuff although not all and i do find some of the packaging amusing if not exactly funny  maybe i have a sense of humour my real gripe here is that i happen to work in packaging supply and sourcing bit not for them i should add and know they are one of the few companies who actually use starch based film and not plastic which costs about  times as much  maybe you should get your facts righti just tried this wasnt overly impressed with the chocolate and didnt need an essay to read while eating it overpriced i think so perhaps they make really good quality individual chocolates
we aussies have enjoyed their wares since  and like all things kiwi that are worthy and successful we australians tend to adopt them as our own see crowded house peter jackson and sometimes russell crowe  however in the case of whittakers they are still a relatively shy brand here in the land of big backyards and blow flies and it is not always easy to findoccasional scarcity has never put me off the hunt  i have always loved their plain milk and dark chocolate blocks and was thrilled to see their dark chocolate orange g at the local supermarket  this quarterkilo slab of heaven is made with their delicious bittersweet dark chocolate that has a cocoa content of  and is generously studded with generous chunks of soft chewy crystallised orange peeltherefore it was with great anticipation that i unwrapped the selfproclaimed zestful block  this combination of dark chocolate and subtle orange oils is a superb pairing  i know that all good and sensible chocolate lovers and reviewers should leave a square on their tongue for a at least a few moments to enable a decent tango with the taste buds but it was impossible not to enthusiastically chew through the softish chocolate in order to reach the orange  crikey it was hard enough reminding myself to stop inhaling the stuff in time to take a picture of some of itwhittakers is the kind of quiet achiever brand that cadbury should be nervous about  they are more authentic and much more skilled at pairing additional fillings and flavours with much better quality chocolate and additional ingredients and they are more than welcome to become an adopted aussie icon any time whats the chance of finding these in the uki absolutely adore their sante bars which at  grams are enough chocolate to satisfy the craving without requiring you immediately go on a  mile run look out for their  ghana bar and their coffee bar exact name escapes me oh and a friend who likes caramel says the dark caramel bar is worth having a first born to sacrafice to get it she doesnt have kidsyes anabels their other blocks are also fantastic and i hope to do a few more reviews on them as wellits mocha the coffee one with real coffee beans its awesome and you should all try the dark ghana as well im also trying to buy these whittakers blocks in the uk any suggestionswhy can i not buy your dark orange chocolate in hamiltondark orange chocolate my all time favourite but why can i no longer find it in masterton supemarkets  even tried wellington last weekend  
ive already gone into some detail about the unusual packaging design and naughty stickers on the box what we really need to know is whether or not filthy have managed to create something worthy of their own hypethese cheeky chocolate bites have the same thick belgian milk chocolate shell as the rest of the filthy range but the inside is made from a blend of  cocoa dark chocolate and cream this combination results in a much thicker filling than the crme brle bites something much more akin to a rich truffle rather than the fluffy insubstantial creme brule centres which i found so disappointingthe filling is thick sticky and very rich and as you crunch through the milk chocolate shell the first taste is a bittersweet cocoa hit which melts into the milk chocolate filling your mouth with a lovely darktasting mixture which melts away and allows the last of the milk chocolate to give a sweet finishi think i should have tried these lovely little things before the crme brle bites theyre far more indulgent rich and tasty than their siblings and to my mind they fit in the filthy ethos a lot better theyd make a great after dinner treat as a box of twelve would easily satisfy four people because they are just so rich and creamyso once again i find myself reconsidering my original verdict im still not a big fan of the creme brule bites but i would definitely buy a box of these cheeky choc bites as a special treatthanks to chloe and sarah the pr madames for sending these over evidently it was worth your whilesusie the fact that you feel the need to spam chocablog like that does not give me a great deal of confidence in your producti have to say i personally was more impressed by the crme brulee bites than the chocolate ones a less sophisticated palette maybebtw have you tried the strawberry bites yetgeez  you were mean in your post  nobody was spamming chocoblog just announcing a new site  for a person who buys chocolate in the tube station dont be so meanhi does anybodys local sainsburys still sell this product i live in northern ireland and have tried all my local sainsburys but to no avail when i asked on sainsburys helpline they said they were reducing their stock range and due to poor sales they were no longer selling filthy chocolate bites i think sainsburys is the only distributor at the moment but if anyone knows better please let me know
this bar arrived in the post earlier this week  not a sample from the manufacturer but a gift from my sister with a note saying i saw this and thought of you i do love this job sometimesat first glance the packaging is quite eye catching but doesnt quite hit the mark on closer inspection it comes in a nicely designed box but the chocolate inside is sealed in cellophane it looks cheap and doesnt quite fit with an apparently organic product then theres the writing on the back of the box   long paragraphs about how wonderful and fluffy montezumas is and what genuinely nice people they arethat set of some major alarm bells any company that feels the need to try to sell itself after youve already bought the product is usually hiding something before id even opened the box id decided that the makers probably were not wonderful and fluffy at allbut enough of all that how does it tasteunfortunately its quite difficult to describe how this bar tastes because it doesnt taste of much at all i can tell you three things it doesnt taste of though sweet paprika strawberry and somewhat unfortunately chocolatethe packaging may extoll the virtues of montezumas unusual ingredients with phrases like weird but great delightfully odd and we never claimed to be conventional but theres one key phrase that really stands out for me and thats extremely subtlethe strawberry content consists of tiny flecks of freeze dried strawberry that are so subtle the only way you can get the slightest hint of flavour is to let the chocolate melt away entirely first even then you probably wouldnt know it was strawberry if you hadnt read it on the wrapperi cannot even taste a hint of paprika in this bar and the  milk chocolate just tastes cheap its not offensive tasting it just does absolutely nothing but slowly fade away in my mouthim really disappointed by this bar id had such high hopes for the flavour combinations and i feel quite bad giving a negative review to a british chocolatier but im more concerned that i have a dark chocolate bar still waiting to be reviewed please let it be better than thisso you didnt like it then how ungratefulthe weird but great and delightfully odd seemed so appropriate for you dom next time ill add a pot of paprika sprinkles hxnoo i loved this bar i was browsing and was surprised you hadnt reviewed many montezumas chocolates please review some more and hopefully you may like at least one chocoate by them  i get what you mean about the packaging thoughnot me fighting their corner again  but i didnt really get the bar although my wife loves it totally  she tried to but some online and plainly they didnt like it either as it has been stopped  but i did try their dark side milk bar and loved it  try that one dom or maybe get out into the sun moreis there anything else that aztecs love eating if so contact me backdylan the aztecs didnt eat chocolate they drank it 
i was going to review them separately but theyre so similar i thought id review them together theyre both g bars of solid  dark chocolate the only difference is the origin of the cacao beans usedat first glance both bars look exactly the same with the only difference being the illustration on the front of the box indeed if you stuff a chunk into your mouth and chew it like a chunk of dairy milk or heaven forbid hersheys they taste pretty much the same tooyou can tell youre dealing with a quality product from the start each bar is packaged in a matt grey box with shiny gold highlights and carefully wrapped in gold foil opening the foil and youre greeted with a beautiful glossy bar of dark chocolate which each square marked with the amano logoafter extensive testing i found the madagascar bar to be my favourite its slightly sweeter and fruitier than the ocumare bar and really quite pleasant if you only buy one bar id recommend the madagascar but if you really want to learn about chocolate get both and follow the amano tasting guide and youll discover just how different two bars that superficially look the same can befor dark chocolate lovers i cant recommend these highly enough if youve never had dark chocolate or simply dont like it you may not going to appreciate the work thats gone into creating themits certainly not a chocolate you should stuff your face with or try to satisfy a sugar craving with but a few chunks eaten slowly and savoured will definitely lift your daylooks wonderful  i wonder if they ship abroad i thought  sure enough they have a selection of  different countries on their order formso i complete the form and put in spain and my postcode  sorry it was not possible to calculate shipping for this order  no shipping options in the ups quotes setand there i am dumped  on a page that asks again for my country and postcode  no way forward no way back  no way to mail and say do you actually know where abroad istypical american supplier im afraid even if it isnt typical american chocolatethank you for another fantastic review and seducing me to pursue this heavenly sounding bar of dark delighthowever after adding a bar to my online shopping basket i have to ask is the delight worth  help keep me away from the submit buttondom  its funny ive had three of these bars now and much prefer the ocumare but i think i simply prefer ocumare in just about anyones bar chocovics is pretty good and about  the price here in the statescliff  typical american supplier  wow pretty harsh north americans feel pretty much the same way about ordering anything from  europe did you try emailing themhttpamanochocolatecomaboutcontactushtmlhi this is art im the head chocolate maker at amanowe try to work with people from other countries that want to order our chocolate  unfortunately the shopping cart system we use does not work well for calculating overseas orders shipping  so if people send us an email we will calculate the shipping and get back with them to work it all out  this takes a lot of time on our end since it all has to be handled manually but we do the best that we can to make everyone happy after all isnt that what chocolate is all aboutin addition we are working with a european supplier to bring our chocolate to europe on a regular basis so even if the shipping does not work out youll be seeing at least some of our chocolate hitting europe in the not too distant futureartloved every bit of your blog postreally looking forward to read more fantastic
weve all seen the adverts on tv this isnt just any  insert name of food this is marks  spencer whatever well this is marks  spencer  organic fairtrade cocoa milk chocolate made from beans grown in peru and panama if this chocolate were a dog it would be a pedigree pooch alright  impeccable credentialsi just found it a bit too spice and not enough chocolate im sure that the chocolate they used tastes absolutely marvellous  you can feel  it melting away as you taste it its rich creamy and probably packed full of all kinds of cocoa flavours but the spices trample it to death i found the nutmeg a particularly strong flavour and it just killed off what ought to have been a rather lovely tasting bar of very good quality chocolatethis isnt just a mistake this is a marks  spencer mistakecomments are closed
have you ever heard of a catch ignore me if you have if not then please allow me to contribute to your excellent bloga distinctive red foil wrapper reveals a classic arch shaped milk chocolate bar with the traditional flat undersidethey say soft caramel and crisped rice in milk chocolate  id say its more fudge than caramel possibly a caramel fudge but with the emphasis on the latter i find the the french description much more appetizingchocolat au lait fourre caramel moulet et riz croustillantthe bar is a very simple idea done well the flattened arch of fudge has been dipped in chocolate then the rounded archside rolled in rice crispies then the whole thing is once more dipped in chocolateits a lovely texture more than anything else and a real bonus for me in that one of my favourite bars was dairy crunch but i stopped buying  them decades ago when i found out what a bunch of cts nestl are and boycotted all their products chocolate and crispy rice is an awesome partnership and the added bonus of a spine of creamy fudge works a treat herei cant tell you what percentage of chocolate is used here because the wrapper doesnt say but it does admit to g of fat per bar i ate  of them while on a two week holiday and found them infinitely superior to their main barbadian rival the hilariously named oh henry which is basically a west indian version of baby ruth of goonies fame another one i cant buy nowthe burning question is why cant we get these over here are there any similar bars out there that havent been swallowed up by those bstards at nestlhave a look at this sitecatch is very popular in trinidad too i love it and wish i could buy them in the usi love them too and no so far i dont think you can get them outside of ttand there are no similar chocs by other companies  catch is readily available in ireland and taiwan  just for the recordhello i was googling looking for a chocolate vendor in barbados and came across your blog so cool and ive forwarded to a friend my question for you is  i need to order holiday gifts for several colleagues in the caribbean including barbados since we cant ship chocolate from the states without customs issues any chocolatiers or stores you can recommend on barbados who might put together chocolate gifts thank youcatch is fine but serious chocolate lovers would do well to check the locallymade bars from agapey they manufacture from bean to bar in small batches and the only ingredients are the best types of cacao bean cocoa butter and barbados plantation reserve sugar which is probably the worlds best no stabilizers no flavourings no lecithin just top quality essentials utterly deliciousomg yes i remember catch  its been years since i last had one  i remember everytime i had one it was a good day  does anyone remember cheers and ping pongs they were the equivalent to chocolate mms and goobers  i am going way back to  when i was living in barbados  what about corn curls and torontos  i havent had a turnover in years  wow i have to go back sooncatch sounds really tasty i must try and find a bar to try it
the most striking thing about these lindt bars is definitely the design it looks like a thin slab of chocolate with capsules stuck on the front its quite unlike any other design ive seenthose capsules mean that the bar looks very thick when wrapped but in reality its just a g bar once you have the chocolate unwrapped you get a mild aroma of cherries its a smell that reminds me of some milkshake from my childhood  a memory thats reinforced by letting a chunk slowly melt in the mouthbut as soon as that chunk breaks the liquid centre flows out and you get a much stronger cherry hit personally i found it a little too strong for a big bar of chocolate  its almost liqueurlike and just a little overpoweringim sure there will be people that love this  its all good quality stuff but its not my favourite lindt bar by a long way the flavours are just too strong and the centre is too liquid potentially very messy if you accidentally break a chunki liked it i ate it all without assistance but give me one of the more subtle and finely crafterd petits desserts range over this any daythis is without a doubt the best chocolate ever i love chocolate and have tried a lot of different chocolate all around the world but lindt cherry is the best one evercan someone please tell me where to find these i love them but i cant find them anywherehelpjoan amazoncom sell them in the us ive added a link to this posti really am desperate to get hold of this chocolate i live in londonwhere can i find it somebody anybody help me find me this chocolate pppllllleeeeaaaasssseeeeewe have some in a shop in bedford i think i can check next time i go if you wantor you can come and look for yourselfwhere in bedford would this shop be also does is have the rasberry flavouri didnt look hard because i didnt think it would be hard to come by but its in town forgot the exact name of the place but its in the arcade somewherei could either meet you in town sometime and show you the place or go there myself and check next week click my name to find my email on a forum profile either that or wait till next week and ill check they definately have different varieties of lindt though was fairly sure there was an apple one but ive seen a lindor orange in poundland which is rather closebyas a side comment i recently got a bunch of stuff from uruguay one of which was also like this in terms of design  filling was an orange creamsadly  like the dairy milk g bar milka and other chocolate i got with it  it lacks taste feels like my taste buds diedhmm it isnt letting me leave commentsah it is now ok well i posted last night twice but it didnt publish either one  er its in the arcade between poundland and pizza hut fairly easy to find  i could check next week sometime for you if you want and repost here with my findingsright  it is arcadia in the town centre in the arcade between poundland and pizza hutthey sell cherry pistachio strawberry cogniac a whole bunch of others there phone number is on the siteanyway if you want i can buy some and send it to you if you are too far away they said they would also take orders as well or we could have a chocablog meet  aka an eatemup chocablog staff and readers alike all enjoying an orgy of lindtinganyway theyve got a fair few lindt bars  they used to have  cocoa and they had the cuban madagascar and ecuador bars but they sadly have all gonethis chocolate can be found on ebay and also on a couple of websites i recommend for anyone to try i just wish it was easier to get hold ofi lllllooooovvvvveeeeeee chocolate 
its funny how sometimes things pop up in the oddest of places leading you on a trail to something else hhow i came to find this tea is one such talei like a bit of music well actually i like a lot of music all types a friend gave me a copy of a prince buster cd and one of the tracks hard man fi dead if you must know contains this verse chocolate tea chocolate tea whats that  i wondered and continued to wonderuntil i came across thiswarming slightly spicy but with a definite cocoa kick to it and very good for you so they sayit smells very cocoay in the cup and this comes through when you drink it of course it isnt at all sweet but you could add sugar and the spiciness while not hot may not be to all tastes but i rather like it give it a go if you have  a taste for the unusual you may be pleasantly surprisedwhoda thunk an old reggae song would have resulted in my finding chocolate tea cheers prince bustercould you please send me onehibye inui tried mine both au naturel and with milk and sugarknowing that indian tea is officially with milk and sugar but im not yet sure which i like best both taste great i love this stuff am a fan of most of the yogi tea range but i think this one is my favourite  so far at least  i see from the website they do a similar one with chilli which sounds right up my street but i havent seen it on sale anywhere yet i just wish it was a bit cheaper oh i like it without milk or sugar although i imagine its nice with as welli love the cold season and chili yogi teas so ill have to hunt down a box of these i think out of this world stock most of the varieties but i cant remember seeing thisi love this tea was wondering what health benefits its has and is it fattening at all
im sure i cant be the only one who looked at the packaging above and sighed at the word perles i dont know why they cant just call them pearls  or better still just go with balls whats wrong with balls nestlthe next thing that made me go huh was the packaging a small cardboard pouch with five individually wrapped chocolates inside thats all well and good if youre giving these as part of a bigger gift or as a christmas stocking filler as these were but on its own the box just looks a bit naffbut what about the actual chocolatewell the balls sorry perles look exactly as youd expect small and chocolatey the truffle filling inside is quite firm despite the packaging calling it gorgeously softbut the taste is spot on the milk chocolate is smooth and creamy as youd expect from nestl heaven and the dark filling is deliciously nutty and chocolatey the combination is pretty damn goodim not entirely sure who would buy five chocolates in a box but as a taster these are certainly worth trying i have seen bigger boxes of these as well as bars and id recommend looking out for those instead i dont think just  perles will be enough for most peoplehi chocablogjust thought id say hello nice looking interesting site looks like ill have to subscribecheersjohni like the caramel latte ones talk about blissp
fragrant figs ripened in the aegean sun paired with zesty oranges enveloped in our rich dark chocolate heaventhe back of the wrapper continues in the same vein asking the buyer to summon all their willpower and hold back while breathing in this chocolates aroma they have used trinitario cocoa orange zest and figs from the female trees apparently male figs are inferior to produce this bar and theyre obviously very proud of it the interior of the wrapper hasnt been wasted either open it out and stand by for a potted history of the company and a rundown of where they source their ingredients fromi liked this approach to presentation its informal informative well laid out and makes good use of the space available as for the chocolate itself im pleased to report that it doesnt disappoint either at  its reasonably dark and the zesty tangerine flavours of the orange hit as soon as this touches your tongue as the chocolate melts away the citrus flavours continue to build in a most pleasant way and the little chunks of fig are set free to be chewed up with the last of the chocolate its the fig taste that youre left with at the finish as you chew up the remaining pieces rounding off what i consider to be a jolly tasty little chocolate barof course being organic means that its not cheap but i think seeds of change are onto a winner here there are a few other bars in this range and based on my impressions of this one i wouldnt be too surprised if you see others appearing on chocablog in the near futurei only discovered this range a few weeks ago myself and i think they have some of the best chocolates out there i especially liked the dark chocolate bar of theirs it was so creamy somehow i know that sounds like a contradiction but it was just yum all of their bars that i have tried so far were delicious have fun with them i found this same chocolate in the airport in amsterdam at first i didnt want to pay the price but decided on the treat for the  hour flight saved the wrapper so i could find it again the combo is delicious i was impressed that the flavors were so strong not just a hint of orange and figs found your blog searching where to buy it other than schipol airport
thank you mms australia thank you  you may have disappointed me last year when you advised that it was too difficult to manufacture peanut butter mms in australia due to not having the correct machinery or the will to even attempt to do so for your most ardent fans and so on and so forth but youve more than made up for it by introducing us to your new line of mms with dark chocolatewhat i dont understand is the total lack of fanfare for this fantastic new flavour  i havent seen any advertising anywhere for these little discs of delight and they were nearly hidden amongst all of the christmasthemed boxes and bars lining my local supermarket shelves  somehow my true chocoblog nose won out and i soon found them  delicious destinyit was difficult to tell who was more excited about the smallish g bag in my hands  me the reviewer or love chunks my everwilling tasting assistant and husband  we decided that a perfect mm munching opportunity would be in front of the telly that nightwe werent disappointed  the dark chocolate was a distinctly different  and much nicer  taste than the usual milk chocolate variety  not that i dont love the milk chocolate mms because i do and have inhaled more than my fair share of the little fellas but these new dark ones are in a class of their owna glance at the back of the packet  after shaking it in the hopes that a few lone ms might be still hiding in there  revealed that the chocolate consists of a minimum  cocoa solids  as such the dark side dwellers amongst us might scoff at mars confectionerys definition of dark but my taste buds werent worried in the slightest  mms delightfully crispy outer shell also meant that they were on the sweeter end of the scale and most definitely moreish  one gorillasized handful was nowhere enoughyou can accuse me of pathetically clutching at straws but i noted that the fat content of these divine little delicacies was g per g which if compared to the dark lindt chocolate fat content of g seemed almost dietlike in comparison well i was certainly going to try and tell myself that after scoffing my exact share  g  of the bag in less than half an hourin the words of australias oldest and vaguest popmusic guru molly meldrum do yourself a favour and get yourself a bag or seven of these dark blue beauties  statneedless to say uk wont have them i got some in france when i went i think thats what they were anyway dark maroon pack if i remember or purple and very nice wasnt so long ago that they brought orange mms back into the uk packs unless the ones i had lately were imports more than likelyomg my prayers answered airmail them to me from malaysiaa whole blog about chocolate yay i cant find the dark choc mms anymore have they gone are they hiding im getting desperate
of course as we have previously noted petits desserts dont come cheap however this isnt a bar youre likely to consume in five minutes its very rich quite dark tasting and really does put me in mind of a rich chocolate mousse i could see this being served up with a cup of good strong coffee to round off a meal and being very much appreciated by alllike its companions in this range petits desserts dark orange s a fine example of the art of lindts chocolatiers its top of the range stuff and it tastes like it all i can hope is that they continue to produce more petits desserts because we have yet to find one that hasnt made us want to wax lyrical about it these are for special occasions or for when you feel like you deserve something special  and special is precisely what they aregrrr where can you get this here in bedford we have one real chocolate and sweet shop but i dont think they have this at allthey do have a lot of interesting stuff though some i dont think ive seen mentioned here either i wish shops like woolworths and tescos would sell more varieties of lindt 
this little box of mini do is a perfectly formed box of chocolates in miniature measuring around cm square this box contains  perfectly formed milk dark and white chocolates according to the obligatory menu we havepraline nougat x crisp chocolate truffle cream cream and vanilla truffle crisp hazelnutpaste mocha praline truffle x cream and pistachio trufflereading that list i have to say im a little disappointed despite the fact that all the chocolates look different many of them have very similar fillings and theyre all ever so slightly well blandnow dont get me wrong these are beautifully made chocolates and they look amazing i just wish as much thought had been put into the flavours and textures as had gone into the design  there is a little bit of variation in the consistency of the truffle fillings but not enough to be able to tell one from another with looking at the boxtastewise its very difficult to get a good idea of quality with chocolates this small suffice to say its not offensive in any way but it doesnt stand out either all the chocolates are sweet and creamy and the truffle flavours very quickly overwhelm the chocolate onesnow i may be being a little over critical here simply because my hopes were so high when i opened the box id love to see duc do take the concept of a mini box of chocolates but make them taste as exciting and fun as they look until then im sure these miniature chocolates would make a very welcome gift for a miniature friend but i dont think ill be buying them myselfhow much did those cost i picked up something as a house brand here in the states for  theyre not bad kind of fun because the pieces are so tiny and cute but i agree that they all tasted the same httpwwwtypetivecomcandyblogitemtraderjoestheartofchocolatehi dom  we have a lot of the dor or should that be doh varieties here in australia and theyre bland  if you get given some as a gift avoid eating at all costs and instead open them immediately and offer some to the gift giveri have picked these up in the uk for p for the size shown and  for the next size up that is basically two of the try above in a longer box witch would make the bigger box p more for the same amounti was disappointed in these they seemed quite bland a little like the lack lustre and vague menu all tasting much of a muchness i certainly would not be able to tell them apart or identify them in a blind testthat said for a pound they look nice and are a little differenthello i recently was given a g tin of duc dor chocolates and was at first scepticle because as a chocolate lover id never heard of duc dor before and i allways like to choose my own artisan chocolates to buyi read your comments about being dissapointed and i was suprised because i found the duc dor chocolates lovely yes they were well designed and finished the chocolate was well tempered so had a nice snap when i bit into them and also the flavours i thought were just right to my experience belgian chocolates are not too sweet unlike some other chocolates which leave a harsh after taste of sugar on the top of your palate i found duc dor to be suptle and smooth on the palate with very nice fillings the one i really like is the amande with the whole almond inside which does not get overpowered by the encased chocolate fillingmaybe you should give duc dor another go they really are a fine belgian chocolateand ive no connections what so ever with the company or anyone who works with themyours sincerely  alan raymond irelandi was given the box of double the size shown on this site i love absolutely love these chocolates i have gone on line to try to find out how to purchase more but ive had no luck finding the site where i can order some of them for myself and friends actually i like any miniature chocolates and cant seem to find anyone who makes them any help anyone
raspberry and chocolate is still something of a rare combination here in the uk so i was rather pleased to have found this bar on sale in a branch of whittards in london as regular chocablog readers will know i rarely have anything bad to say about lindts products so the prospect of tasting their milk chocolate and raspberry bar had me rubbing my hands together and smiling to myself as i made my way homeas you can see this bar has a liquid filling which marks it out as a first among the huge range of lindt bars i have sampledim not sure if this is a new addition to the lindt range the packaging is certainly unlike any previous lindt bars i have seen so i can only hope that this is one of a range and not a limited edition bar that will soon disappear from the shopstheres a lindt bar exactly like this here in the us and its been around for years so i dont think itll disappear anytime soon if you find another try putting this bar in the fridge for a day or so its great cause the cold makes the raspberry filling crystalize a little so you get a nice texture when you eat it if youre ever passing through marylebone stop by the sweet shop in the station they seem to have a full range of lindt bars including all the petits desserts i picked up the cherry version of thisthat picture looks like jabba the huts having drooling issuesi remember my sister was scoffing this bar in the early s or late s even siknce when i developed a taste for it it has been difficult to get hold of until recent years when whittards precollapse and management buyout started stocking a range of lindt bars and have continued to do so to this day they do have advantageous pricing for purchase of three bars at one time at these shops prior to that it was only stocked in specialist confectionerychocolate shops a minor criticism i have is that lindt could perforate the bar a little deeper because the bar can split on the diagonal which causes the very sticky liquid to pour out you also get a free piece of quality cardboard as a protector with every barthere is also a bar of polish chocolate with a raspberry filling although more like a jelly but with a very good taste now available it is far cheaper than this bar but is available in british supermarkets such as morrisons ill make a note of its name and post back
the first thing youll notice about this bar is the very plain packaging a plain white cardboard box with homemade stickers and the best before date written in biro for me that kind of thing gets my attention much more than fancy packaging  this is obviously handmade and that usually means its either going to be really good or really badso which is itwell luckily we have a winner hereaside from the fact that my bar was broken hardly surprising given its been through the uk postal service at least twice this is a deliciously warming bar of dark  chocolate perfect for cold winter nightsbiting into a chunk the first flavour to hit you is the rose oil this is the same stuff that turkish delight is flavoured with and the taste is very reminiscent of a good quality turkishthe next flavour that hits you is the smooth rich dark chocolate its fairly sweet and complements the rose flavour perfectlyfinally  and only when most of the chocolate has melted away in your mouth  does the chilli start to make itself known but its not a strong kick just a subtle warmth that builds in your mouth as the chocolate disappearsin summary a rather delicious bar with wonderful flavours i would have no hesitation in recommending this as a firsttime chilli chocolate bar it will leave you feeling warm inside without kicking you to the floor and stamping on you like some hot chocolates canthis is definitely a case of a product that speaks for itself no fancy packaging or expensive web site just delicious chocolate perfectunfortunately i dont think the chilli chocolate is available from the chocolate cellar  maybe exclusive to little green men who supply the chillishellothis is bala from the chocolate cellar  yes  we do supply the bars we have not yet had a chance to add them on to the website as it is a new product cost is    ppplease email me if you would like to purchase somegreat  thanks for letting us know balahurrahbala  chocolatier  chocolate cellarthis reviews mention of little green mens customer service was based on my experiencemy first order never turned up even after chasing it up by phone and i asked for a refund the second order arrived incomplete and was only completed after chasing them up by phone again they never replied to my mailso despite my issues being rectified one way or another i cannot recommend shopping from little green menpaolawe are delighted to have won the foods north west award for this bar we are selling this directly from the chocolate cellar now our new shop and hot chocolate cafe are based in liverpool city centrefor nepali and indian food all curry powders have saimlir ingredients i use curry powder and cumin powder from winco in indian stores you can buy different types of curry powder but i dont normally use those sorry about the late reply i was super busy did you make the sauce
the dark chocolate shell is  cocoa solids thin and light on the base and sides and slightly thicker on top the cream filling is pretty much as one would expect white in colour sweet and gooey but the taste of the mint is something rather special its an incredibly smooth taste that increases in intensity as you chew but never becomes harsh or overly warm on the palate instead it builds up to a mouthwatering peak and as you finish the sweet you are left a taste of slightly sweetened mint that lingers on the tongue beautifully in spite of the obvious sugar content of the cream filling i found these to be rather moreish and id be very interested to see what other minty confections summerdown have in the pipelineid recommend these as an excellent slightly posher alternative to your usual after dinner mints especially as summerdown have revived a great english product im all in favour of rediscovering great old tastes and classic foodstuffs so these will definitely feature in my dinner party menus at some pointcomments are closed
ooooh something from cadbury that i havent tried before ive only ever seen chomp in those christmas variety packs that cadbury like to push on children all over the country and thats exactly where this came from  part of an even bigger box of chocs that the chocstress sent mechomp is a very small bar the wrapper doesnt actually give the weight presumably being part of a bigger selection pack it doesnt need to but its actually gof course the question youre all asking now is what is chomp luckily the answer is simpletake the thick chewy caramel and milk chocolate from a curly wurly and squeeze it into a more conventional shape and thats chomp its very simple and very yummy and despite coming in a tiny package its actually just about the same weight as a modern curly wurlyso its nice its chocolatey and chewy but it just doesnt appeal to me in the same way that curly wurly does theres something pointlessly stupidly childishly brilliant about the shape of a curly wurly chomp may have compactness on its side but its just not the samei used to love chomps when you could buy them on their own for p a mainstay of all school kids of the s me thinks i agree though the extra p for a curly wurly was a much better choiceyeah i remember chomps at school with fruit salads black jacks and the small milky ways havent they gone up in price quite a bit p nowi havent had a chomp in yearscurly wurlys will remain forever my favouritei agree with laura curly wurlys are bettai live in ireland where chomp bars are readily available for  cent al my local corner shop and curly wurlys are like  the only thing about the corner shop is that she charges  centabout  p for a dairy milkplainand  for a regular kinder buenoripoffbut still chomp every day is something to be proud of pdoes anyone remember the orange flavor chompsthey were amazingim trying to see if you can still get themwow youve never had a chomp before you can buy them outside of the variety packs lol next to the curly wurly and fudges etc ive never been that fond of chomps or curly wurlys i always preferred fudges i just wish they were bigger lol
spoiled for choice as i was i plumped for the cherry filled bar cherry bars are still fairly rare beasts and im quite partial to cherries anyway so it seemed like a good choicenow poland isnt a place youd normally associate with great chocolate on the contrary my experiences of polish confectionery as supplied by grandmother and aunt over a number of years have been uniformly disappointing but i was prepared to put this all behind me and to approach this bar with a fresh attitudethe bar itself looked fine and smelled suitably cherrylike if a little on the sugary side a glance at the ingredients explained why  g of a g serving is sugar the chocolate itself is only  cocoa solids as well so basically what we have here is a mixture of sugar and fats with some creamy filling and a little cherry jamthis might well appeal to those of you who love sweet sweets but to my mind this was nothing more than oversugared cheap nasty chocolate its a little like cadburys dairy milk with extra sugar and a bit of jam and cream filling theres nothing particularly good about it it doesnt taste all that nice and from the look of the ingredients it isnt that good for you either needless to say i wont be rushing back to the sklep to sample any more wedel barsaww it looks so yummy aswell please stop the testing on animals it is inhumane and so so wrong it makes so many people suffer to know what you are doingehas far as i know chocablog is not tested on animals and the only suffering i can think of might be a slight toothache from time to timei think you are slightly confusedsimon its a little known fact that i dont talk about very often but i do in fact force a small army of fluffy kittens to read chocablog every nightyou should try ptasie mleczko by wedel as opposed to chocolate that you described it is really good try kukulki too  mmmmmhttpwwwchocoladkacomindexphpcpathoscsidaceeadceedethis e wedel chocolate is sheer cherry liquid wonderment you people who dont enjoy it stay away from polski you turd burgalarssimonif you didnt like this one simply dont try other filled wedel bars all of the follow the same template other solid ones are quite ok
as you can see from the tin it contains no less than  real chocolate real belgian chocolate no less but as i learned to my disappointment with drink dark choc that is no guarantee that it wont also be loaded to the gunnels with sugar the good news is that twinings have taken a similar approach to hotel chocolat with their product this drinking chocolate contains only  raw cane sugar making it remarkably similar to liquid chocolate in consistency and flavourthe powder in the tin is in fact made up of shaved belgian dark chocolate mixed with cocoa powder so mixing it to a paste takes a little longer than it might do but the end product is a satisfyingly rich slightly bitter drink with tons of lovely chocolately flavourmost importantly twinings have left it up to the consumer to decide how sweet they want their drinking chocolate so if you fancy popping a spoonful ofsugar in you can or indeed if you prefer to add the liqueur of your choice you can do that toothis is a fine quality premium drinking chocolate very similar in taste and consistency to hotel chocolats liquid chocolate its drinking chocolate for grownups dark rich and bursting with the bittersweet flavours of good quality chocolate and cocoa id recommend serving it with a tot or two of your favourite booze and a dollop of whipped creammmm sounds very nice ill look out for it next time i go shopping im glad i found this blog as i am a bit of a chocaholicdont know if its just me but im always left with a pool of melted chocolate in the bottom of the mugcup even after blending and using hot milk tastes very nice thoughi think thats pretty inevitable there must be some portion of the cocoa solids that cant be kept in suspension in the milk i occasionally whizz it in a blender or use a hand blender and that seems to do the best job  plus you get a lovely frothy head on your cocoahave you changed the shape of the container from oval to round i can no longer find the oval one the round tin seems to be a different producti need to find out who stocks twinings chocolate indulgencecan you find twinings chocolate indulgence for me i have searched everywheredoes anyone know where i can buy twinings luxury chocolate drink   i have been buying this for months and i am so hooked on this drink  i have tried every supermarket i can think of but they all seem to have stopped stocking this item  i have also tried the round tin and yes the product does taste differentcertainly does not exist on the twinings uk website
but unlike after eight which have a creme filling these wafers are solid dark chocolate  the peppermint oil is part of the chocolate itselfaside from the aroma the first thing you notice about these is how uniform they are each chocolate is a precisely cut  x  x mm wafer yes i measured it myself with a slightly rough surface on top and a smooth undersidethat rough surface is down to a generous sprinkling of granulated sugar within the chocolate that might seem odd but it adds a rather nice texture to these otherwise quite ordinary chocolates bite into one and you get satisfying crunch but the sugar dissolves so you dont end up with crunchy bits stuck in your teeththese work perfectly as an after dinner mint but i did find is that the peppermint is a little strong for my liking you cant really get a good idea of how good the chocolate is and i did start to get an odd minty headache when i tried to eat five at once but then i dont think thats what theyre designed forafter eights without the creme filling o
heres a very seasonal little stocking filler  christmas pud flavoured choccies from sainsburysthese were lurking under the tree on christmas day and it wasnt too long before i was beginning to wonder what theyd taste likethe chocolates themselves were nestled inside each clad in a very seasonal gold foil wrapper once unwrapped they looked very appealing and quite puddinglike im guessing that the white chocolate topping was there to represent brandy butter or creamonce bitten they proved to have a lovely thick shell  no scrimping there  and a very soft delicately spiced truffle filling which had fruity mixed spice overtones and a sweet creamy finish it was after the chocolate was finished that the pudding flavours really came into their own in a mildly pleasant wayas novelty chocolates go i rather liked these they werent particularly spectacular but they were certainly the only christmas pud chocs ive seen and as such im glad i had a chance to taste them there was nothing unpleasant or overpowering about them and i did appreciate the fact that they had such chunky shellsi suppose its unlikely that youll see these for long now but if you do and theyll probably be on sale id recommend them for the novelty valuejust to say how much i enjoy reading this blog happy new year and may lots of superb chocolates with lushiously innovative fillings come your way thanks for that lovely comment and a very happy  to you tooheres hoping we can continue to entertain and inform all of our readers and looking in my special chocolate cupboard i suspect well be off to a good startchocolate pudding i have never heard or read about such kind of chocolate before maybe someday i can write about it in my chocolate blog i will keep it in mind thanks for the informationhappy new year from austriathorntons do xmas pudding truffles theyre tasty but too much alcohol flavour for me
as luck would have it our lovely neighbours jill and andrew invited us over to their house for prechristmas nibbles and drinksand then things started to really feel like christmas jill brought out a  kilogram box full of fardoulis shellshaped truffles  what a wonderful way to end a year for this chocablog writerthe rum truffle was a perfect combination with the rum cutting through the sweetness of the milk chocolate and lingering afterwards  to follow this with one of fardoulis cappuccino truffles was a divine experience  again the genuine taste of the coffee was the ideal partner to the milk chocolate  even better was that it was a warmish south australian day so the chocolates were soft and incredibly flavoursomeandrew then threw me a melon illusion which ramped things up several notches  despite sounding rather incongruous  milk chocolate with midori melonflavoured truffle inside it was a triumph  it had a floral perfumy taste that wasnt overpowering but left me and the others at the table wanting more  which of course we didwhat was also nice to discover was their price per kilogram is significantly cheaper than lindt and the in my opinion way overvalued ferrero rochers  at the time of printing fardoulis chocolates have yet to break into south australia but i sure hope they do  i wish jill the very best in her marketing methods and will most certainly be willing to hand over my hardearned for any of their truffles  besides ive yet to try their mint orange  macadamia strawberry  macadamia hazelnut praline rum  hazelnut baileys cognac  hazelnut strawberry champagne cosmopolitan cocktail honey  macadamia ginger  macadamia b cocktail and cherry cream flavourscomments are closed
anyway however you choose to play with your food what we want to know is whether or not the product actually tastes goodi have to say that i liked the form of the packaging as you remove the lid the box opens out like some sort of cubist flowers revealing the contents nesting in sellophanethe premium brand perception is further reinforced by the number of chocs in the box  for  creme brulee bites isnt cheap by anyones standards thats p per bite so i was expecting great things from filthy alreadythats where it all went wrong after all the hype the anticipation the build up and the promise of decadent indulgence these little bites turned out to be filled with a light soft mousselike filling and it was all over in seconds it was like fancying the pants of someone having them flirt outrageously with you promising you all manner of naughtiness and then when it comes to the crunch what you get is amateurish unsatisfyling and ultimately disappointing how very sadim afraid i have to say that i think filthy have spent far too much attention on their web site branding and image and far too little on what really counts which is good quality great tasting product the chocolate is okay but the filling is about as substantial as a cloudon the base of the box is a note which says if the product falls short of expectations then you should be hard on them and that theyd like that well chaps heres a sound spanking from uncle simon i expect better next timewe had some of these in the office today caramel they were awful could not believe theyre a fiver a box
i found these in john lewis and i have to confess that i was attracted by the packaging and the name according to the box charbonnel et walker are established as britains master chocolatiers since  but thats just the kind of thing that sets alarm bells ringing for me  whenever someone tells you theyre the best its usually a sign that their products arent good enough to speak for themselvesi have to admit to being pleasantly surprised when i opened the box the presentation was good the chocs looked great and there was a strong champagne aroma there are two layers of trufflefilled  milk chocolate balls so far so goodbut as i bit into one my heart sank again the milk chocolate was fine the truffle filling was fine although it doesnt taste anywhere near as good as it smells but it was just so ordinary they were nice enough but there simply arent any exciting textures or flavours here i have to say that it concerns me that we have so many medium to high end chocolatiers that are churning out stuff that tastes and looks the same yes there are a few chocolatiers trying new and exciting things but if i had to judge by this box alone charbonnel et walker doesnt appear to be one of themso where can i get good champagne truffles hopefully as an online order  you just saved me us  please write me i would highly recommend lmasion du chocolat truffles absoultely the best so far in us you can order from nyc store and sometimes neiman marcus carries themi loved the charbonnel  walker champagne truffles  they filled my senses with a warm champagne glow as i bit into the fine fresh quality dusted crisp chocolate surface  a true hit high recommendation and i would purchase them as a gift for someone special  try them i dont think you will be disappointed
like their milk chocolate brethren these four also offer a unique flavour from a different part of the world and as such would make a great little stocking filler for your chocaholic friendsrelativesselfthe first of this quartet is perhaps the most normal of the fourhaving said that it is rather unusual to come across a bar with this high a cocoa content i have stated in the past that i consider  to be cooking chocolate as extreme levels of cocoa tend to make the whole taste experience rather cloying as there isnt much room left for cocoa butter or other smoothing flavours well im pleased to say that this bar has forced me to revise my opinion yes its dark and has a bittersweet edge to it but it also packs a rich deep cocoa flavour with a soft tangy finish its not as citrussy as some cocoa beans but the dark rich taste is very pleasant indeedthe second bar has been commented on here by a reader who i believe said it was too much for them to takethe scent of peppercorns is immediately noticeable  a sharp slightly tangy smell which of course is only amplified when you pop a piece in your mouth and it starts to melt however unlike the hc bar which was studded with whole peppercorns this is a dolfin blend and so you only come across tiny fragments of peppercorn as the rich dark chocolate melts away i found this to be perhaps the best peppery bar i have tasted the balance of flavours is once again brilliantly executed and while it might not be to everyones tastes dolfin have carried it off in stylei must admit that when i saw a lavender bar i was a little trepidatious the new tree experience wasnt one of my great favourites as i found the taste a little overpowering and the texture somewhat strange well for a second time i am forced to rethink my opinion of lavender and chocolate dolfin have blended the two flavours together to create a lightly scented floral bar with a delicate soft taste as the chocolate melts away you do come across tiny fragments of what i assume is lavender flower but at no time does the flavour become overpowering  not a hint of grannys pot pourri here well worth trying if like me youre a little wary of flowery chocolate barsthe last of the four contains one of my alltime favourite spices and has been somewhat hard to trace in a chocolate bari dont know about you but when im cooking a curry i find myself leaving the cardamom pods out so i can nibble on them i adore the taste and have only ever come across chocolate and cardamom once in a belgian truffle so this was going to be my special treatof course the tastes of pepper and cardamom have been blended with the chocolate in the dolfin style and so i wasnt going to get the big hit of cardamom i wanted but i found the balance of the peppery flavour and the cardamom produced a warming slightly sweet spicy flavour which was both interesting and delicious of course there are tiny chips of cardamom among the fragments of spice in the bar and i was able to nibble little pieces to enhance the overall tastemy overall opinion of these bars is that they offer the inquisitive chocolate fan a marvellous opportunity to sample a disparate range of flavours from all over the world made by a company whose approach to chocolate making typifies the current wave of exciting bold chocolatiers who are striving to bring us new taste sensations without compromising on quality or being wacky for the sake of it admittedly at first glance some of these flavours may seem a little strange but if youre curious about new tastes and interested in exploring what the world of chocolate has to offer id say that these little bars are a fantastic way to start a couple of these bars have made me change my opinion of certain flavours which can only be a good thingoh no guess i should have read this before picking up that tranquility bari loved pink peppercorn bar when i had it i had high hopes for the pepper and cardamom but for some reason the white pepper really disagreed with my tastebuds 
if youve never seen cadbury heroes heres what you get in the box pause for breathphewand yes with the exception of dairy milk whole nut weve reviewed the full sized versions of all the cadbury heroes coolall the chocolates in heroes are pretty much the same as their full sized counterparts with the exception of crunchie which contains small pieces of honeycomb in milk chocolate resulting in more chocolate and less crunch and whole nut which consists of a single hazelnut in dairy milkas is often the case with these kind of mixes you can always tell which ones people like and dont like by looking in the box when theyre half gone you may not realise it while youre actually eating but subconsciously youll always pick out your favourites firstin my case the fudge and caramel heroes disappered first and  i was left with all the solid dairy milk and dairy milk whole nut chocs theres something incredibly cute about a tiny bar of dairy milk but i find them just a little dull as sweetsall in all though i love heroes theyre cheap fun and made for sharing over christmas but it must be noted that mars make a very similar product with miniature versions of their top selling chocs called celebrations so i guess ill just have to go out and buy a box to compare them oh its a hard lifeyou can buy heroes online using the links belowi got given a box of these just last week only here they are called favourites and the selection is a little different flake instead of twirl no fudge or whole nut because we dont have those full size bars here it includes cherry ripe which is pretty much the only way to get a cherry ripe in nz also the crunchies are proper crunchie bars in miniture of course rather than what you described also  i always eat the ones i like least first and save my favourites for lastwtfi love these we have a kg tin for xmas i cant waitwhat chocolates are in the heroes these days as far as i remember you changed some thingsjust got bought some of these and the contents have indeed changed you now get twirl twisted creme egg dairy milk dairy milk caramel bournville eclairs fudge so only  varieties now bring back crunchiei wrote this  years ago and as much as they seem to have changed i dont think i can bring myself to buy another box to try themheroes used to be great now they are rubbish used to get  decent chocolates now only   and eclairs wtfsort it cadbury would have happened is cadbury stayed british
sometime last week i was getting ready to go to work when postie knocked at the door instead of the parcel i was expecting i was delighted to discover that i had been sent this  despite my inner fat bloke yelling at me to crack open the box and at least try one chocolate before i left for work i refrained of course most of that day was spent trying to second guess what hotel chocolat might have come up with this timethe menu described this box as containing mellow warming chocolate recipes that perfectly capture the changing of the seasons and a glance at the names of some of the chocolates suggested that these were going to be nutty fruity and in a couple of cases slightly boozy choccies as you can see the presentation of the contents is excellent with a branded centrepiece chocolate on each layeraside from being delicious in their own right hotel chocolats products always seem to have been made with a great deal of thought regarding the look of the finished item take for example the chocolate walnutnow anyone could take a walnut and smother it in fine dark chocolate but hotel chocolat have created a beautiful half egg look which offers a tempting peek at the contents id have to come out and admit that its hard not to like hotel chocolat they obviously have a great passion for what they do and it shows there isnt a bad selection to be had here theres no padding nothing secondbest every one of these chocolates offers a unique flavour combination and while they may not veer off into the more eccentric or unusual theyre all winnersthis is definitely a great box of chocolates give this as a gift and you cant go wrong first off the recipient will know that you love them enough to buy them what will undoubtedly be a rather expensive gift and secondly if they love their chocs then this box will have them loving you even more with every one they eat to cap it all the chocolates are made from cocoa grown on hotel chocolats own estate and they have a great attitude to what they call applied ethics my advice to you is to keep an eye out for this becoming available and to buy it for someone you love especially if that someone is youcomments are closed
here in oz it is released under the old gold label and compared to the mundane ordinariness of dairy milk it really is a quiet achiever and good value for moneyhowever the plain old gold dark chocolate isnt spectacular by any means but it goes particularly well with another flavour combination  the perennial favourite of aussie dads everywhere is old jamaica  rumnraisins  this is a real winter chocolate best eaten after dinner over a game of scrabble or whilst out camping  the dark chocolate is on the sweetish side but somehow sings to the rumsoaked or artificially flavoured if i have to be nitpicky raisins ensuring a perfect combination  the chocolate takes its time to dissolve in the mouth before leaving the scrabbleplaying dad with one last burst of rum when chewing the soft raisins  this bar is an  aussie favourite and deservedly soold gold macadamia is a brash newcomer to the old gold old fellas stable and holds its own amongst the old gold original old gold rumnraisin war horses remarkably well  kind of like a the empire strikes back to old golds star wars a new hope if you permit my foray into scifi nerdinessa person with some selfcontrol would probably consider this chocolate a bit too sweet to have much of but that person isnt me  this block is dangerously moreish and by far the cheapest way to enjoy the moneymaking macadamia nut than if you bought them on their ownhave you tried a block of old jamaica melted and stirred into a tub of vanilla icecream then allowed to reset when serving drizzle with a bit more plain old goldwhat does giving cadbury a good old bollocking entail i didnt know that about queensland do all the cte dor bars come in those two inch pieces like the lait melkgiving cadbury a good old bollocking was regarding my previous article on their truly craptacular range called desserts available here in australia  after suffering through boysenberry shortcake and fudge brownie ive yet to force myself to try their lemon meringue flavour  and thats a rarity for me  reluctance to eat chocolatei remember old jamaica and the pirates in the ads dont ee eat it all up at once from the s im not sure if its available in the uk but id certainly like to see it come back good find millythis was one of my grandmas favorite brands of chocolate she would have some shipped over every year before christmas the macadamia was my favoritei just bought one of these to try and its not bad very easy to eat way too much of it if the cocoa were a bit higher and the sugar a bit lower it would be even better its got a nice whiff of rum as well though i expect its not real rum in there  nibbling on the macadamia nut bars between roadhouse while traveling in the outback made my drive so much more delightful combined dark choc   fry  ups a week  statins and tourist walks  i dropped  bad cholesterol points in  daysanyone know whatever became cadburys guinea gold chocolate i seem to recall  it was a kind of smoother version of rum n raisins it was my favourite chocolate but alas i havent seen it for many yearsdoes anyone remeber a chocolate bar called a guinea bar i lived in melbourne in the early s and this was my favorite at the milk bar is cadburys old gold the same thingi love the old gold almond dark chocolate i have eaten a variety of chocolates from different countries but the aussie old gold is in a league of its ownmy daughter have been reading about cadbury old gold dark chocolatesthe reviews are fantastic and wants to really try ither husband is into liqueur tastewhere can i order or buy these chocolates here in the usthanks a lotelfe bowerman
if youve ever seen an arnold schwarzennegger movie youll know that when you see a man wearing shades carrying a  foot long cardboard box under his arm and walking toward your house its time to hide behind the sofaa box that size only ever contains a shotgun and the man with shades has one mission to blow you away so youll forgive me for being a little hesitant when the doorbell rang this morningon peering through the peep hole i was somewhat relieved to see the words royal mail on the mans shirt but still not entirely happy i mean ive dealt with these postal service types beforeluckily the postman was benign and the box did not contain a shotgun oh no this was something far more bizarrewhich brings me to a potential flaw at least half of these chocolates either contain alcohol or strong fruit flavours and that means theyre probably not going to appeal to kids but its the kids who will get the most enjoyment out of a christmas cracker bigger than any theyve seen i would really like to see a child friendly version of this next year i dont think it would be too difficult to create one version for the grownups and another for the kidstheres a couple of other minor design flaws here too firstly the paper strip that makes that bang noise is a standardsized one when i pulled it it went click rather than bang i had been hoping for industrial explosives and was a little disappointed also the chocolates themselves are packed quite tightly into a nondescript plastic bag inside the cracker a lot of thought has clearly been put into outer packaging but inside it looks like someone just stuffed the chocolates inside im sure this could be improved
attibassi gianduiottithis tiny g pyramid of chocolate was something of a surprise i was expecting a solid chocolate but instead got a solid smooth praline with a delicious nutty flavourloacker tortina originalthis is more of a chocolate biscuit than a er chocolate chocolate im not much of a biscuit person but i did like this the tortina consists of layers of wafer with a hazelnut filling perfectly covered in milk chocolatethe result is light and crispy with a hint of chewiness i wasnt quite as fond of the nutty flavour in this one as the attibassi but the chocolate was delicious and again im sure this would be great with a good cup of coffeeoverall i prefer the attibassi but the moral of this story is clear next time youre in your local coffee shop try the chocolates you never know what little gems you might uncoveri love caffe nero they seem to care about serving good food alot more than starbucks their coffee is better than starbucks tooaaaah  i have a bunch of the attibassi in my office our italian wine vendor brought them in for me to try when i was looking for some chocolates to put in our gift basketsthey are soooooo goodive hidden them from myselfmolly i trust you mean youve hidden them for yourself rather than from yourself you can get loacker tortina from waitrose now when i first tried them i wasnt impressed but they were expensiveish so i had to finish them now i love them and have to get them whenever theyre on offer they are rich and not sweet theres something very smooth about them it may be how the filling and coating mix when chewed they sell another loacker biscuit which is also very nice
in case you havent seen this the pack consists of four milk and four plain bars each of which represents a unique taste from a different part of the world  each of these bars is totally different from the others which to my mind makes them a great gift for the chocolate lover in your life its a pretty safe bet that you wont have seen at least one or two of these flavour combinations anywhere else beforeso lets get startedcocoa beans from ghanaa smooth fine milk chocolate blended with nibbed cocoa beans from ghana which add a subtle yet intense cocoa finish as you nibble the little pieces once the chocolate melts away the inclusion of these tiny pieces of cocoa gives the whole taste experience a final lift as you release that cocoa intensity lovelygreen tea from japani mentioned in my review of the masala bar that i rather fancied getting my hands on some of this as im rather partial to green tea anyway oh yes and the odd bit of chocolate too well im delighted to report that this is another winner the bar has a slightly rough texture on the tongue but you get an immediate release of an intense tea flavour which gives the smooth milk chocolate a distinctly richer darker undertone another winner in my book and one which made me very happygreen tea and jasmin from morocconot my first encounter with a milk chocolate and flowers combination but equally bizarre the scent of jasmin flowers is intense to say the very least and the bar has a grainy texture which i also found a little strange  presumably the green tea as the jasmin content was flavour only of the four id say this was the odd one and most likely to divide opinions amongst anyone tasting it not in itself unpleasant but definitely left fieldthis is definitely a winner like a cup of milky chai with a chocolate twist a subtle blend of warming spices which compliment rather than overpower the delightfully smooth milk chocolate i went into some detail in my original review but if you cant be bothered to have a look take my word for it when i say that this is well worth a tryso there you have it next time ill review the four dark chocolate bars no doubt there will be a similarly eclectic range of flavours on offerdolfin has recently popped up in one of the specialty food shoppes around here  i will definitely pick some upi recently came across dolfin on vacation and purchased the milk chocolate infused with green tea and jasmin from morocco straight away i could sense the heady fragrance of jasmin and the bitterness of green tea which made this to be a stand out in my books not quite any other chocolate i will certainly be on a mad hunt for these in sydney as ive enjoyed this treat rather too quickly
every now and then however cadbury australia likes to develop a few new quirky flavours to add to the dairy milk range  they invariably fizzle out because when the main ingredient is the same old dairy milk chocolate theres a finite limit as to what you can do with itthus i present you with two blocks from their optimisticallyentitled desserts range  fudge brownie and boysenberry shortcakelets start with fudge brownie  to say that this flavour was a disappointment is rather like saying that hitler was a bit of a grumpy bum  this sickly sweet brown syrup inside the chocolate was about as comparable to a fudge brownie as jordan is to naturalborn beauty  it was awful  the filling didnt even taste like chocolate let alone fudge or brownie  it might just as well have been sugar syrup with swamp mud mixed in for some authenticlooking colourin fact it i rather tempting to report cadbury to our nations advertising standards council for being so blatantly untruthful in their advertising and labeling of this particular productperhaps the rage and indignation will be quelled as we move on to the second dessert boysenberry shortcake  then again perhaps notthis boysenberry bogus was almost as flavour fooling as the farfetched fudge brownie  in reality it was a strawberrylike runny filling with what felt like tiny flakes of desiccated coconut inside  it was only after reading the back of the label that i found out those coconut bits were actually one per cent shortbread crumbs  wow  a whole one per cent  again im wondering just how cadbury can dare label something shortcake when it comprises only one hundredth of the entire product  if they were going to be honest they could have called it same old strawberry with fiddly bits but i suspect it may not fly off the shelves as fastthese two flavours will fizzle out just like their other attempts have  people will be curious and buy them to try and after one taste wont be buying them againcadbury get it through your heads  people buy you for your getwhatyoupayfor safeashouses dairy milk not your ridiculous attempts at new flavours which are quite frankly insulting to our taste buds and brain cellswonder what cadburys chocolate makers would say if they tasted lindts petits dessertsyoure right i bought these and the third variety lemon cheesecake and after one taste i threw out the rest of the bar i most certainly wont be buying them again and ill be much more wary of trying anything new that cadbury brings outthanks for warning me river  i have the lemon one sitting in my cupboard but after the first two flavours i use the term very loosely im not that excited about trying the third one  my bet is that theyll be on drastic special straight after christmas and then never heard of again  fingers crossed anywayi have never heard of these chocolates ive heard of cadbury but not the desserts ones hmmmaybe its just in austrailia that they are availablesome time ago i had the good fortune to sample one of the creme brulee bars received via a holiday gift basket  while the ingredient declaration did not settle well with me the bar itself was actually quite good it was so good in fact that the next time i went shopping i tried to locate it in the international foods section of a local supermarket  unfortunately there were none to be had that day but im sure it will surface somewhere along the linehello not happy with cadbury changing thier blocks from gram down to  gram they have made the block slimmer and now with one of my favourites hazelnut instead of whole nuts you now just get lots of little chips of hazelnut it is crapalice it is not only the hazelnut but all the nut varieties are just chips of nuts now instead of whole nuts if they had to reduce the size due to costs fair enough but to change the product is just a stupid move i bet when their sales drop because people no longer like their product the managers will just blame the global reseccion instead of their stupidity in changing the product
conscious chocolate best ever hint of mintthe ninth to be sampled in the conscious chocolate range and one i find myself liking rather a lotusing organic peppermint essence in the dark chocolate base gives this bar a refreshing blast of clean air type mint kick more of a hit than a hint if you ask me but something that i definitely found myself wanting more of the mint flavour comes flooding out as soon as you take a bite of this bar and it lingers on the palate for a good while after the chocolate has gone giving you a lovely clean fresh finish certainly one of my favourites in the range and well worth a try  after all just how many good quality mint choc bars are there out therethe final bar in the range isbest ever spiced up and fruitythis bar contains sultanas apricots himalayan salt and tangerine essential oilhaving tasted the fiery hazelnut and chilli hot bars i was expecting something tonguetingling for the finale but instead i was very pleasantly surprised by the citrus and salt flavours this is another of the bars that has bits  in this case pieces of sultana and apricot  but its the addition of the tangerine oil and salt that give it an intriguing and slightly exotic flavour when i allowed the chocolate to melt in my mouth it was these two tastes that came to the fore leaving me with a mouthful of lovely fruity bits to chew on afterwards the apricots taste fantastic by the wayid like to thank emma jackman for her generosity and i hope some of you decide to support her by trying these bars for yourselvesthese look great i wish they were available in australia i would by heaps
so how does thorntons offering measure up can it compare to lindts offeringwell not quite but its not far off as you can see this is a large box of chocolates  and pretty good value too at  for  chocolates compare that to the  i spent on  decidedly average godiva chocs and im sure youll agree this is a pretty good deal in comparisoni dont have the space in this review to talk about all the different chocolates in this box suffice to say theres a good mix of white and milk chocolates with different fillings i would have preferred a few more dark chocolates but there should be something for everyone heremost of the fillings are variations on the soft truffle theme with one exception  a white chocolate filled with a very light lemon mousse i wasnt expecting anything so light and citrussy so this was a bit of a surprise a pleasant one thoughthe quality and presentation of all the chocolates is good and while not up to lindts standard it certainly offers better value for money if price is an issue for you so would i buy these as a christmas gift but what i would certainly consider doing is buying a box of these to have around the house for guests over the holidays an alternative to the more usual tin of quality street or roses
these have been languishing in the back of my fridge for a while note the best before date so i thought i had better review them while they were still ediblechocablog isnt the place to go into an indepth analysis of the goji berrysuperfood cult but if youre interested its easy enough to find information claiming all kinds of magical properties for these small pink berries for the purposes of this review i am more concerned with how they taste when smothered in dark chocolate obviously if theyre also good for you then thats a bonuswhen i opened the bag and poured a few out onto the table i must confess that my first thought was sheep poo these small shiny pellets of dark chocolate just happened to put me in mind of camping trips and hill walks not perhaps the best startnow ive never personally tasted wolfberries other than in a strange alcoholic drink i bought on a finnish ferry so i was intrigued to know what theyd be like my first mouthful was something of a surprise  the berries vary in texture from very chewy raisinlike texture to rock hard almost crispy little nuggets they require quite a bit of chewing to release their flavour by which time most of the chocolate is a fading memory on the tongue the chocolate itself is dark and quite rich but there isnt so much of it that it overpowers  the berry flavours which follow the taste of the berries is rather lovely i can best describe them as having a similar flavour and colour too for that matter to rosehips a light fruity taste that can only be released with some good prolonged masticationassuming that these little things are actually good for you id recommend them as a lunchtime snack or an emergency boost for when youre having a tough day or involved in some physical activity but only if your teeth are in good working orderthis combination gives a lot of antioxidant power but as you say  your teeth must be in good working orderoooh  ive always been a bit suspicious of goji berries the whole antioxidant bandwagon rolls eyes but these look good actually  i might have to hunt these down in a better than half price sale till now i didnt tasted chocolate coated goji berries but it seems to be very tasty and gives more vitamins and antioxidants than before
before talking about these deliciously divine lindor balls i need to apologise to you all dear sweet intelligent and discerning chocoblog readers  normally these articles are accompanied by close up photographs of the chocolate itself unwrapped and sometimes halfeaten to give you an idea of what it looks like  i have nothing but envy and respect for cowriters dom and simon who are able to do this when in the presence of some truly fine examples of what is capable of being produced in the wonderful world of chocolatesadly i was unable to  in my defence i did photograph the boxit was immediately after opening the lid that things got a bit out of controli have no excuse other than to explain that these little black balls of beauty were far too irresistible to stop eating long enough to photograph  my husband love chunks will also be able to back up my claims because he helped me eat themwe both sat back on the couch licked our chocslicked fingers and relived the experience  at  cocoa content these are without a doubt lindts finest lindor balls ever  here in australia they only seem to surface at christmas time and we mostly have to content ourselves with the dark blue variety not sure what cocoa content but a bit less than  which can also be hard to hunt down if restricted to the local supermarketthis chocolate contains the perfect combination of bitterness to sweetness ratio in top quality dark and is also the rare kind of real dark chocolate that also magically melts in your mouth instead of retaining the harder grainier quality of most dark varieties  well it would melt in your mouth if you have the strength to resist chewing on it like a cocoastarved crazy in order to reach for a second third fourth fifth one  from the moment it enters the mouth to the very last taste on your tongue you are well aware that you are in the presence of some truly good chocolate  dear lovely lindt company australia  why so stingy with their availability  for the love of all thats good and right with the world make these godly globular delights available everywhere all the time  pretty please i have to agree these are truly the best of the lindor chocolates  here in canada they also only come out at christmas time so i am sure to always stock up  di imagine those in combination with hersheys kisses like one ball then one kisses and so on would be really goodwe have a  lindor bar here as well same stuff and very yummy it is tooi had one of the mint dark chocolate ones after lunch today the local store has an assotrment of individual ones for sale at all time i frequently go down there when i am at work to buy one to allow myself not to kill customerssometimes i think dom and simon have just a little too much selfcontrol  excellent review millymooi probably would have finished the whole box too why i read and dont reviewim going to hunt them down the lindt lindor  cocoa bar is irresistible i think this will be great toothese are my absolute favorites i was given a bag of them for my birthday after eating two i made the mistake of leaving the bag in the living room when i arrived home from work the next day all that was left was the bag absolutely delicious
in my defence they are particularly interesting looking chocolates i actually had to double check to make sure they were edible and not some unusual christmas decoration  squirrel food comboas it turns out these are milk and white chocolates coloured and decorated to look like pine cones acorns and other autumnal tree fallage clevertheres only nine chocolates in the box but they are very big and all have a thick nutty praline fillingunfortunately they are way way too sweet have a funny smell when you open the box as though they really had been made from random things that had fallen off trees and the label on the back says alergens milk gluten nuts soya in unnecessarily large letters helpful maybe but not particularly inspiringall of which is a little bit of a shame because they look so good had they not been quite so sweet i would have been tempted to buy a few boxes and use them as edible christmas decorationsoh well i guess ill have to go chocolate shopping againany filling i like hersheys chocolate by the wayyeah its a truffley praline filling a thick extra sweet pastei think i would have preferred them if they had been solid chocolate
and on the th day god just stayed in bed and stuffed his face with chocolateits been some time since ive been as excited by chocolate as when i first saw this box sparkling on the shelf in john lewis a simple blue box with slightly metallic finish embossed in gold with the words lindt and preciousdelicious assorted filled chocolates with stunning gold dust pearl and diamond effectsim such a girl sometimesfor a split second i contemplated giving this box as a christmas gift but then i wouldnt be able to review it and more to the point i wouldnt be able to eat it all myself so with some anticipation i opened the boxi was not disappointedthere are  chocolates inside  each of  varieties and they all sparkled like jewels and im happy to report they taste as good as they looki was slightly surprised how similar all the chocolates are theyre all milk chocolates with variations of a soft truffle style filling i was initially disappointed that there werent more  exotic tastes here but then it hit me lindt want this box to appeal to everyone so theyre not taking chances with unusual flavour combinations here the precious collection may be chocolate bling but as bling goes its quite tasteful and more to the point its utterly utterly delicious its sparkly chocolate heavenif you give a box of these to a loved one this christmas you cant go wrong unless of course youve accidentally eaten them all beforehand but be warned the heartbreak of a loved one receiving and empty box of these would almost certainly count as a mitigating circumstance when said loved one stabs you through the heartthey were i hope i can find these or similar in adelaide i know  or  people who would love to get them for christmasomg deliciousoooh i hope they have these here in canada now i will be on the hunt they look so deliciousthey do look perfect scratches one person off of her christmas listthey look so cute cant wait to hunt them downoooh pretty
for obvious reasons the label caught my eye immediately who wouldnt fancy  pure belgian chocolate especially if it came with a hefty dose of pure indulgencethe contents of the tin seemed to bear this out  a bag of chocolate pellets not powder and with a cocoa content of just under  however a quick read of the other contents revealed that the sugar content of this product is g per g thats over  sugari followed the instructions on the tin and made up a mug of this stuff using  rather than  teaspoons of the pellets i added hot milk to the pellets and stirred them into a paste watching the milk turn all chocolatey oops sorry wrong product and having a good sniff of it as it melted it did smell rather good and i was looking forward to my first mouthfulthen came the disappointment  this stuff is absolutely loaded with sugar as i sipped at the drink all of the subtle cocoa flavours that began to spread across my tongue were completely stomped on by an overpowering sickly sweetness if id been ten years old id probably have loved it but if i had a ten year old theres no way id offer this to it as a bedtime drink  youd have to strap the little blighter to the bed after this kind of sugar rushi cant help feeling that this is an avoidable error surely all that is needed is for drink dark choc to drastically reduce the amount of sugar in their chocolate and to add a simple add sugar to taste at the end of the recipe instructions instead what should be an adult chocolate drink comes out tasting like a cheap confection and one so sweet that i suspect the majority of purchases have been one offs and thats probably why it was going cheap when i found it i cant help but think that if this product is going to succeed with its target consumers ie adults then that sugar level is going to have to drop dramaticallyit my be cheaper than liquid chocolat but i found it nowhere near as appealingcomments are closed
one of my favourite childhood sweet memories is proper oldfashioned nougat huge bars of the stuff that were so thick it was a struggle to bite a chunk off bars of nougat with the texture of polystyrene sandwiched between two pieces of cardok so im weird but i loved the nougat my local sweet shop used to sell in the early s it was nutty fruity and chewy and unlike anything else but ive not had proper nougat in yearsas you can see the box contains nougat pieces two varieties of nougat halfcoated in chocolate the darker one is flavoured with chocolate orange cranberry and hazelnuts and the lighter one with almond and honeythe front of the box says the chocolate is a blend of milk and dark but the back of the box calls it milk chocolate either way its quite tasty and definitely adds something to the nougat of the two i prefer flavours i prefer the more unconventional chocolate flavoured nougat  not because of the chocolate but because it has a real fruitiness that comes through when you start chewing itpersonally i really liked these  weird polystyrene texture and all  and demolished the box within a couple of hours if youre not a fan of hard chewy nougat you almost certainly wont like these  but if youre the same age as me they might just rekindle memories of your favourite childhood sweet shop sighyup  i used to love the old fashioned pink nougat too of course my favourite sweetshop was the one i lived in
in case you hadnt noticed its winter here in the uk and in the run up to christmas we are being assailed with spiced foods comfort foods and of course more and more gourmet chocolatewell this is part of a range from belgian chocolatiers dolfin and it seemed appropriate to review this hot masala milk chocolate in the chill of wintertimein case dear reader  you  are unaware of what exactly constitutes masala i shall recite from the package  cinnamon cardamom pepper clove and ginger hardly something youd expect to find blended with a good quality belgian milk chocolate and exactly why i chose to buy it for more than  years dolfin has championed an original and inventive approach to chocolate the company has brought the art of blending  its permanent leitmotiv  to chocolate making the ingredients are directly mixed into the chocolate mass adding exotic spices subtle flavours or fruity zests to top quality belgian chocolate provides countless temptations for the taste buds to convince all the gourmets of its philosophy dolfin also revisits the great classics the idea is to be daring but remembering to recognize the charm of recipes that have stayed the test of time this quest for authenticity results in recipes that are not as sweet favouring instead natural ingredients to make this knowhow accessible to everyone dolfin has created a range of  g chocolate bars because outstanding chocolate deserves outstanding packaging the original flavours of dolfin bars are contained in a special carefully designed wrapper ensuring the perfect conservation of the chocolate and its aroma the wrapper can be opened and closed over and over again it is easy to carry around and share the dolfin bar can be taken anywherethe packaging certainly is unique bearing more than a passing resemblance to a pouch of rolling tobacco than a choccy bar wrapper and yes the chocolate itself is definitely not too sweet so if like me you prefer the tastes of the ingredients and not a big mouthful of sickly sweetness then the dolfin range may well be worth tracking downi shall be making a point of trying to find more dolfin products i particularly fancy their sencha green tea bar so expect to see more reviews here in future recommended as a special treat or a present for you chocaholic been there done that friendshere in the us masala is more often just dubbed chai since its the same blend of spices that go into chai tea ive tried a couple of chai bars and the theo  phinney one was my favoritei have tasted the hot masala bar and loved it  i also tried the pink peppercorn bar yes that right pink peppercorns  where i live canada you can buy pepper flavored potato chips and i cannot get enought of them  i had great hopes for pink peppercorn bar but it was a disaster  much to strong it was like opening up a pepper shaker and taking a big sniffgive it a shot its worth it but only oncewatch this space  more dolfin reviews coming sooni had the chance to try stainer chocolate madras after reading your review amazing chocolate bar i think they are one of the best in the market bit expensive but you get what you pay fori bought the pink peppercorn chocolate in the uk at tesco and thought it was delicious i didnt find it overpowering at all the pepper flavour comes out when you bite into one but then there is a wave of chocolate flavour that envelops your mouth and taste budsfantastic give it a try
i found these belgian chocolates in john lewis  part of a fairly large display of christmas chocolates  most of which i ended up buyingas its a small box i think the easiest way to review them is a quick comment on each individual choccyall in all im a bit disappointed by these chocolates godiva seem to be trying a bit too hard to make an arty collection but havent paid a great deal of attention to detail you know little things like how the chocolates actually tastei wont be buying these again and the deciding factor for me is the price at   they work out at over   per chocolate thats simply too much for these rather average chocolates if youre buying them as a christmas gift you probably wont get any complaints  but you could do a whole lot better in terms of quantity and value if you get something elsei know theyre very highly regarded in the states but i just find them overpriced i havent tried a whole lot of their boxed chocolates they just bore meyou know what guys i totally agree with you it is over rated not worth its price at all and too sweet for my liking too
now im a summer child and as a consequence i love strawberries real strawberries i cannot abide anything that is strawberry flavoured so i was relieved to find that this bar contains  strawberries the other notable ingredient aside from the  cocoa dark equadorian chocolate is green peppercorns you may have seen or tasted salads which combine strawberries or raspberries with things like rocket so this combination would seem to have its origins in modern cookery if salads can be classed as such the question as with all of these things has to be  does it workwhen i opened this bar i was immediately hit by just how powerful the strawberry aroma is considering that theres only  freezedried strawberry it packs quite a punch and as you can see the pieces of berry seem to be evenly distributed throughout the bar there are also other inclusions  small islands of light green are dotted hither and yon yes whole green peppercorns await the unwary tasterwhen i popped a square into my mouth i was immediately aware of the peppercorn content a warming feeling spreads across the palate as the chocolate begins to melt and then the strawberry high notes join in lending their citrussy tanginess to an otherwise dark and spicy set of flavours as the chocolate leaves the palate youre left with the strawberry flavour as a finishing note and its a lovely cean sort of finish to a thoroughly enjoyable mouthfulmore good news this was bought in the uk so if youre looking to try it it is out there somewhere and well worth tracking down if only to scare your conservative relatives with at christmasok i think i need some of thative seen this around and ive been meaning to try it ive had the hachez blackberry bar and found it pretty good so ill have to actually buy this one next timeto borrow from the life of brian  you lucky bastard mean with all due respect envy and droolingother flavours include raspberry and balsamic vinegar lemongrass and ginger salted peanut mango and chilli they all sound rather yummy
these have been around for quite a while but ive never really had the urge to buy them primarily because they look so insignificant this small pack containing two rolls weighs just gof course the weight or lack of it is down to the fact that this bar is made with two of the lightest elements in the universe  milky way and wafer despite being so insubstantial they are as youd expect quite tasty and moreish the filling is very light and very very sweet and wafer has exactly the right level of crispinessi love themlove from swedeni was disgusted to hear a very dear close friend of mine had never tried these very crispy rolls quite franklywhere has she beenbest thing since sliced breadoh ayeabsolutely love these add the fact that you can pick multipacks up in the p store is just a bonus have you ever heard of a white chocolate crispy roll
it will come as no surprise to you to learn that the chocolate is indeed the same as that used in the petits desserts range  a smooth creamy slightly sweet milk chocolate with a great texture and flavour the important thing here is the fillingas you can see it does exactly what it says on the wrapper the chocolate conceals a light almost fluffy cream filling which melts before the chocolate and floods the mouth with a milky creamy flavour which sets you up nicely for the chocolate if you ever ate those chewy milk bottle sweets as a child then the taste of the filling will probably put you in mind of that  concentrated creamy milkinessas i have come to expect with lindt bars the choice of flavours is a good one  they are well matched and offer a new twist on plain old milk chocolate pun intended the milkiness of it means that kids seem to go mad for it as well  so be advised to keep it safeof course a filled bar takes a lot less time to hoover up than a slab of solid chocolate so i would advise any potential uk tasters to take advantage of sainsburys  for  offer while its onlindt rocks i just had a bar of lindt excellence  swiss dark chocolate made with cuban cocoa beans last night and i am still reeling it was wonderful very mild with a tropical fruity note yummy am planning to swing by the deli later and snag the ecuador and madagascar bars to complete the experience which are if i remember correctly about  and   cocoa content respectively hope you can review these babies sometime sooni believe i have the madagascan bar here possibly both of themthen i guess its time for you to try themhi simon i tried the lindt ecuadorian bar at   cocoa content and although i found it good am afraid it was too dark too soon for my taste im just working my way up into the dark side im nibbling on the madagascar bar right now as i write and i think  may just be my level for lack of a better word waiting for your take on iteu comprei o meu chocolate e muito gostoso
the packaging didnt look too promising either  it resembles a sort of wannabe classy unknown chocolate brand that we aussies tend to see in our  crazy bargain shops at christmas time especially if filled with liqueur or hazelnut crme and often made in such nonchocolatefamed countries as czechoslovakia or hungary  if purchased the bargain hunter tends to get exactly what they paid for cheap chocolate that is best left unknowngingerly i opened the wrapper and was relieved to not be able see any dots of oil or grease on the wrapper  the chocolate wasnt glossy but made up for it by being a very dark colour almost black  this boded well for the claimed slowly gently i snapped off a chunk and very carefully inserted it into my unusually reluctant mouth  italy was much more famous for pasta tomatoes olives and wine  what on earth would they do to dark chocolate  a few moments later the answer arrived  a fantastic jobwitors fondente extra dark is delicious  not the instant meltinthemouth moistly mushy interior of a lindor ball delicious but the grainy deliciousness that you generally expect with darker harder and more bitter chocolate  not that it was too bitter either  it has just enough sweetness to counteract the relatively high cocoa content and not scare off any newcomers to the dark side  in the tradition of a wine critic suggesting that a cheeky red would do well accompanying plum roasted duck with wokbraised asian greens this chocolate would pair up a treat with a glass of ice cold milk or a decent cup of earl grey tea  alternatively it would do just as well as something to slip into your backpack when camping in winter for the energy and carbs of course not as any old excuse to imbibe more chocolatate or when freezing your butt off watching the footballi could see why my local supermarket would import this block from italy to cater for the neighbourhoods large mediterranean population  it is a very nice nottooserious dark chocolate and is rather good value at slightly less than three bucks per block  ill definitely push aside the local nonnas to reach up to the top shelf and buy it againi had my first taste of witors hazelnut chocolate candy yesterday and i loved them  they were wrapped in a copper colored foil wrapper  where can i purchase these  i live in the cleveland ohio area  thank you
now im not usually a fan of marzipan i think the last time i had it would have been in a christmas cake  or  years ago its just a bit too sweet and rich for meand thats pretty much the case with ritter sport marzipan too the  plain chocolate its wrapped in does quite a good job of taking away some of that sweetness but its just not quite enoughthe marzipan itself is also a bit drier and crumblier than im used to its definitely marzipan but its not quite like the stuff i remember from my childhood i think id have preferred it if it was a bit softer and chewierbut whether youre going to like this or not is really going to come down to whether youre a fan of marzipan i know many people who cant stand it and will hate this bar but oddly i dont know anyone who claims to love itmarzipan is one of those things that people tend to either love or hate if you love it youll like this bar if not youre probably better off trying something else in the extensive ritter sport rangebasically it is the stuff germans buy from the supermarket as an everyday chocolate i think i tried around  of all the offered flavors in a quite fat period of my life and the peppermint or white chocolate crisp flavors are kinda addictive but now as i am extending my chocolate horizon ritter sport actually drops way down on my list they probably import cocoa from somewhere but then they add some extra stuff that gives you the definite ritter sport taste that i could figure out smelling a piece of chocolate with my eyes closed this particular marzipane one is a rather bad try with half dark chocolate in my humble oppinioni guess marzipan or marchpane to others is an acquired taste not too keen on it either too cloying for my tastei have just discovered ritter sport marzipan  im now an addict loli was never a big fan of marzipanbutthis is my new favorite candy next to dark chocolate covered almondsthe best marzipan ive ever hadi love love love love love marzipan i really like these ritter sport bars but my favorite is sees candy marzipan next time youre in sees candy be sure to try their marzipani have been an addict to this chocolate my whole life but its quite true it is a very sweet chocolateiam creaving for this flavour of ritter sport but not currently available in my country pakistan what should i dohelp me
the fact that this bar was  cheered me up no end too and the fact that the mousse filling on the box put me in mind of the petits desserts dark truffe cake was never going to deter me either i had high hopes for this oneover the course of numerous lindt reviews ive come to realise that the filled bars merit closer inspection so before diving in i snapped a square and had  a good look at the insidethis bar more than made up for my previous disappointment my faith was restored and i have found yet another great tasting bar to inflict upon visiting friends who it has to be said are coming to expect a choccy tasting in lieu of dessert these days highly recommendedive tried this one too i was good but not great i felt slightly let downchocolate and orange is one of the great pairings of this world food wise its mint and dark chocolate for me though i will definitely try this one soon thanksits a growerwhere do you purchase this i love it i had it in spain once but i cant find it in the us i found this in our local genardi super market didnt see it at any other local markets i think it is deliciousi find these at target cost plus world market and sometimes walmart my favorite of them is cost plus because it also has a wide selection of other chocolates aside from the usual still havent tried that bacon one
so when i saw this bar sitting on the shelf i immediately thought aha lindt coffee chocolate surely the swiss cocoa wizards can come up trumpswrongyep just when i had convinced myself that lindt could coat horse manure in chocolate and make it delicious i find myself backing away from one of their products the strange thing is it should all work i mean we have lindts   dark chocolate with  coffee okay the chocolate could be a little more cocoaheavy but ostensibly the thing should work it just doesnt  at least not for me the chocolate seemed to be somewhat dull tasting and the coffee flavour didnt really lift the overall taste to any new levelthe standout wrong thing for me had to be when i bit into a square and came across what felt and tasted like an instant coffee granule i havent touched a cup of instant in many many years so that really did it for meso there you have it  my first lindt reject proof that not everything they do is amazingly good just most of iti am shocked and appalledhow very dare you  coffee intense is the best chocolate in the world my absolute fave pity i have to go out of town to buy my stash as its sometimes hard to get hold ofin andorra a couple of years ago i came across a lindt milk chocolate with coffee  never seen it before nor since and it was a devil of a job searching for it on the lindt websites  i bought about  bars but they didnt last longthankfully sainsburys seem to be doing the next best thing but it has the crunchy bits in the milk chocolate which the lindt version didnt
oddly enough it was only recently that it occurred to me that i might be able to lay my hands on some asian confectionery there so last week i went there and had  bit of a poke aroundsure enough i found these  chocolate koalaswhat are they well theyre little koala shaped biscuity things filled with a cheap and cheerful chocolate flavoured cream type stuff hardly gourmet fayre but definitely a great novelty item especially as there are a huge range of cute little koala faces in the box so as well as a tasty and they are surprisingly tasty considering the low cocoa content nibble you can spend time looking at the various koalas and if youre a kid playing with them before snarfing them upthe biscuit shell is very thin crispy and has a good crunch to it and the melty creamy filing is darker than you might expect and not too sweet so older palates will also enjoy themas far as i can ascertain from the box see woo import them so i couldnt tell you whether or not theyre available in any other chinese supermarkets what i can tell you is that if youre throwing a birthday party or want a novelty cake decoration which isnt going to send the kids hyper then these could well be worth tracking downtheyre surprisingly tastythese are available to purchase from coles in australia as to a strawberry version of themive seen them at every asian grocery store ive ever been to here in the usi loved the chocolate koalas i first had them during a trip to china this summer theyre so good i saw them in lots of fruit flavors tootheyre also known as koala yummies i think that aside from the strawberry and chocolate versions they also have tiramisu that should be interesting and milkbe extremely careful when you want to buy this there are a lot of fake ones out there the packaging looks really similar also green in colour and the shape of the box is identical be careful the fake ones are not good at allhi i love these i have looked on their website due to your wonderfull web page and cant seem to find them any help would be greatly appreciated as to where they can be obtainedi am almost like a number  fan to koalasthe part ilike most about them is there sleepingwhen ever i go to a website i always see if there is a pic of a koalaif there isnt i go to another onekoalas are cute even if there shaped as cookieskoalas inspire mei love koalasin japan they eat different animalsi am  years old and i hope you type me backwe want to know what all of them look like show a listkoala yummie wars push them together and see who stays alivetheyre available at wegmans and several other large grocery stores in the us as well they are my favorite little snack so i always like to buy a few boxes and try not to eat them all within the span of a few days hint it normally does not work and instead i just make myself sick on tiny tiny koala cookiesalso i should note that these are japanese in origin not chinese a lot of asian stores arent too picky about where they import their things from so in a chinese store it is completely normal to find japanese or korean things and the same with the other things but great review and i love the pictures d

its the way that it shatters that matters is the traditional catchphrase for this famous australian bar which has been around since   violet was the inventors wifes favourite flower and the crumble was the honeycombno doubt youll be imagining that as a proud aussie ill now start raving about this classic icon of a bar and how poor your rightwayup as opposed to down under lives are for not having anywhen you first bite into a vc it is reminiscent of trying to sink your teeth into a teachers blackboard  very chalky and about as orally pleasant as aurally hearing someones fingernails rake across the surface  usually my first reaction on biting into one sadly yes every twelve months or so i find myself eating another one to keep reminding myself as to why i dislike them so much is to automatically spit it back out saying yuck  id rather chomp a chalk stickalso the instant crackle to meltonyourtongue sweetness that is the attraction of the cadburys crunchie is sadly lacking in the violet crumble  instead it has a much denser texture that doesnt dissolve but needs to be thoroughly chewed until it congeals into sticky yellow strands that then annoyingly stick in your teeth and once eaten coat your teeth in furry plaque  not too romantic when trying for a quick snog at the movies  my advice is to avoid them at all costs  get a crunchie and go crazyit therefore doesnt surprise me to find out that hoadleys and in this era of company takeovers  nestl apparently sweep the floors for broken pieces of violet crumble and set them in cute little molds and sell them as bertie beetles at agricultural and sideshows around the country  they actually taste much better this way and are also much cheaperwell that thing really looks like you could write with it on a chalk board i am happy you reviewed this for me so i never have to buy this by mistake i dont know if it is appropriate to do here but i just today bought a plate of lindt hot mango chocolate for a stunning  and i dont know if its because i am only an intermediate chocolate gourmet or what but for me it seems a little ordinary despite the fact it is very tastydear googlemandont ever call yourself an intermediate chocolate gourmet  there is no such thing  in this world of utter chocolate adoration and inhalation everyone is a worldclass expert including youhmm the lindt hot mango chocolate sounds intriguing but its sad to read that you were underwhelmed i dont think we have that flavour down here yetregards  millymoohello you have created a great website about chocolate i also love to write about chocolate maybe you would like to take a look on my website and tell me what you thinkhttpwwwinternationalchocolatescomchocolate forever dgreetingsgooglemani bought the lindt hot grenadine bar at frankfurt airport last month when i was traveling back from barcelona and if i had known how delicious it would be and how difficult it would be to find in the states i would have spent all my last euros on them i cant speak to the mango but this one made with pomegranate is the perfect blend of tart and spicy to compiment the  dark chocolate now i need them herei just went and bought some violet crumble as we call it in our house violent grumble photographed it and then found youd already done itcursesanyhow i think they walk all over the crunchie violent grumbles foreverthe shatter and then slow gooiness of the honeycomb is what makes it goooooodi would have to disagree  the violet crumbles wins hands down in my opinion  i find crunchie bars too sickly sweet and the honeycomb tends to coalesce in my mouth into an unpleasant hard globule  violet crumbles tend to shatter more  a good thing  i suppose thats the chalky consistency you talk about and the honeycomb doesnt linger in an unplesant way on your tonguei dont agree with this review at all i much prefer violet crumble to crunchie any day of the week i agree with matt crunchie is too sickly sweet and it has a strange nonhoneycombed gooey center it eats like a badly set piece of honeycomb anyone who has tried to make it knows what i mean whereas violet crumble is perfectly set like the handmade honeycomb the gourmet sweet shop makes down my way mm perfect thats what honeycomb is slightly chalky its made with bicarbonate after all and when you reduce the bicarbonate like in the crunchie recipie all it leaves is the crumbly sicklysweet sugar blechcrunchie doesnt have a gooey centrei will look for itviolet crumble over crunchie anytimei love violet crumble it has a different texture than crunchie not really chalky as how you put it but more brittle and finer than crunchie it easily gives when bitten into and the chocolate coating is just right to coat the roof of the mouth with rich creamy bliss crunchie for my taste is far more resilient  more difficult to break off with a bite crunchie also resembles the honeycomb texture made at home so i tend to lean more on violet crumble soooo disagree violet crumbles are fantastic i like the fact that you arent overwhelmed with sugary sweetness the second you bite down it builds up and blends with the chocolate as the honeycomb melts in your mouth the crunchie bar has never even come close in my opinion its always been too heavy and thick compared to the violet crumble
i cant tell you exactly why but theres something about these oversweetened mass produced  cocoa aerated chocolate stars that i find hard to resisttheir unique texture makes them melt in your mouth very quickly and theres no denying the high sugar content has quite a kick other than that theyre overpriced over sweet low in cocoa and milk solids and very obviously mass produceddespite everything about these being wrong i still love em but only occasionally in fact if i eat more than one bag at a time i feel ickyforgive me chocablogi love magic stars  theyre yummyyummy yummy for my tummyi like chips they taste goodi just want to say that my grandaughter loves milkyway magic stars and have noticed that you can not buy them in an easter egg so now i have to look for a different easter egg for her and she will be very disapointed because i promised her a migic stars easter egg if you do sell them please can you tell me who you supply them to and what stores if you dont sell them then i am disapointed along with my grandaughteri buy  packets of em every morning and still cant get enough domg they have changed the packaging of the stars im a home shopper for a superstore and noticed it today omg whats going onomg im so annoyed they used to av a puzzle and a character on but now they are boring packetshowever they still taste good so i buy two packets on way to schoolme  my friend wrote a letter to milkyway complaining about their new packetsi still have no replyhaha were in a science lesson lolbye bye xoxoxdoes any  want beef wid da mini fermstef about the packets changing i said the same thing but for god sake it said my name was wrong how the hell does it know what my name is and it said put ur email in and i had it inlynne im afraid theres no magic stars easter eggs but u can get a egg take it apart into  peices and put some magic stars in and then put it back together and wrap the easter egg wrapper back around it and shell think it cracked open hehehe im so happy i could help aswell and i hope it worksi hate emi am also very disapointed they changed the packaging for this tasty treatwhy  change it to such a boring packeti am really sada bout milky way magic stars how can they be milky way when there is no milky way in them dont get me wrong i love them but isnt that false advertisingi just have to put forward the fact that the magic stars are a fantastic treat for anyone in need of foodwe luv magic starz dey taste well nicewe hav  pakits every daime and jack together weigh  stonez now yey off to have a pak nowbyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee xxomg magic stars are like epicme and my m andrej think der just the bestmagic stars ftwpsi love you i love these magic stars chocolate  i had them a few days a go we want white chocolate magic starsi had a massive craveing for them when i was pregnanti used to eat them as a child i still remember the taste even though it has been  years since ive eaten them they stopped selling them in slovena its just sad
its a little known fact that prince charles spends most of his free time making chocolate and the reason its little known is primarily because its completely untruebut i digresswell i was wrong despite being incredibly simple large discs of milk chocolate flavoured with orange oil these are really rather goodthey somehow manage to be both creamy and tangy without being sickly the organic  milk chocolate isnt very strong but its obviously high quality and the flavour and aroma of real oranges really comes throughits also worth noting i paid  about  for this g box which makes them less than half the price of kshocolats offeringhmmm im not yet convinced that chucks duchy farm produces oranges  let alone orange oil  for this product and he or his gardening staff must be incredibly clever for also managing to successfully cultivate the cacao bean in uk temperatures
well since then ive been fortunate enough to meet heavens new cousin chocolate caramel more than once and hope to continue the relationship on a much more regular basis  luckily the ones ive met have been unmelted remained the acceptable brown colour and have tasted even more delectable than their plainer relative  these heaven bars are a bit more expensive than your run of the mill cadbury and nestle bar ranges but worth finding an extra few twenty cent pieces p forplease allow me to digress for a minute about my issue regarding the heaven family blocks  why do quality family blocks have to be so stingy  in the case of heaven they weigh g compared to cadburys g blocks so it begs the question of exactly what families they are aiming at  its my view theyre for welloff singleperson households as opposed to families of more than one person  side by side the two blocks look about the same height and width but heavens are much flatter obviously designed in the hopes that the average shopper wont notice the weight and will be prepared to shell out double the priceno matter  as you can see i consider heaven chocolate caramel the ideal companion with a strong cup of coffee at morning break time  these seven luscious squares of almostlindtlevel chocolate filled with a thin layer of runny rich caramel really hit the spot at am  oh who am i kidding this photo was taken at am and the coffee and chocolate imbibed a few seconds later  it was a relief to discover that the caramel filling is not the burned condensed milk mess that is often found in cheaper bars but a clearer runnier style that resembled a more toffylike brownsugary textureyes dear dark side lovers heaven chocolate caramel is a milk chocolate bar but done extremely well  even if your preferences do go to the dark side as mine do it is still easy to appreciate how superbly heavens chocolate complements the caramel filling  ill keep my fingers crossed that some day some how someone here in australia or the uk will perfect a dark chocolate and caramel combination that will be good enough for me to overlook the scroogy size of their family blocki dont know if you get any whittakers chocolate over there in oz but they have just released a new caramel block here in nz and the caramel is much as you described there plus theres lots of it which i like also the whole block is standard family size and the even better news it comes in both dark and milk varieties
finding myself in john lewis on a saturday afternoon in late october there was nothing else for it i would have to refrain from tearing down the christmas decorations in a fit of rage christmas decorations its october for god sakes and head for the chocolate section insteadi came home with a selection of orangey chocolates including these i have to admit to being primarily attracted to the shiny tin they came in but didnt have much of an idea of what to expect from kshocoltthe paper sleeve that keeps the tin closed informs me these are a fabulous after dinner treat and perfect for dinner parties at this point i was starting to get a little worried im always wary of chocolate that tells me how i should eat it then came the killer blowkshocolat ltd suite  glasgow g tri may be biased but both the suite  and glasgow bits worry me my concerns were magnified when i finally opened the tininside we have eight slices of crystalised orange covered rather haphazardly with chocolate  i have to say i was disappointed both by the quantity and quality on display here id paid  around  for this g tineven the orange pieces themselves didnt have much flavour they were very chewy and quite sweet but not particularly orangey which is a bit weird considering theyre simply slices of real orangetheres nothing offensive here its just a decidedly average product masquerading as something posh and thats my real issue with this a scottish company with a nonsensical and unpronounceable name charging  for  small slices of orange and a tin thats only really useful if i decide to store more small slices of orange of my owni really hate to have to slam a british chocolate company but this is probably the worst value chocolate ive tasted ever its a cheap average product dressed up in fancy packaging and given a price that reflects the packaging not the product itselfhmmm methinks the label is a play on words shockelate  despite your bad review it made me laughvery interesting review i would probably have made the mistake of buying these online had i not read it they sound downright nastyon the other hand after sampling the kshocolat chilli pecans in milk chocolate in an elite chocolaterie in washington dc biagio not far from dupont circle i couldnt leave the store without a tin they are simply divine although pecans are not my favorite nuts and i prefer my chocolate dark  is my sweet spot these were irresistable my husband and daughter agree the milk chocolate is very smooth nicely flavorful and the perfect complement for the searing heat sometimes the heat varies a bit in batch and piece of the adobe chile powder that the pecans are rolled in before dipping the one i sampled in the store was fairly mild and i was delighted that the tin i bought was much hotteri made the mistake of opening them as soon as i got home from our vacation and it was all i could do not to chompndrool all  bucks worth in one sitting before my dh could get home to claim his fair share ill probably pass on the orange slices after your thumbsdown but dont give up on this little company at least when it comes to aztec tastes they do sometimes get it very right my only regret is that i bought the small  oz tin instead of the large one  oza mistake im going to correct as soon as possible since amazon has them and they qualify for my prime free day shipping  this is a lovely toy for my five year old   his face was alhgit with joy when he opened the box and saw all the gold gogos inside the postage was quick and the transaction first rate i recommend this seller
the area of the city i live and work in has a large italian population that emigrated out from the s onwards and we south australians are eternally grateful for their contribution to our culture and community  the supermarkets delicatessens are  therefore fully stocked with the most delicious salamis proscuitto olives and pastas however on the sweet side of things italy is only halfheartedly represented in our shops with staleish sponge fingers for tiramisu chefs and dry hazelnut biscotti for dunking in cups of coffeetherefore i was mildly excited to see this italian brand of chocolate in the supermarket near my work  bianco cuore al latte  in english the flavour is translated as milk chocolate with a cereal filling  not quite so appetizing perhaps but my assumption was that it would be a rice crispie or biscuit type of inside and seeing as it was lunchtime and i was hungry i was very much looking forward to testing it for you dear readersupon opening the block the obvious signs of oil smears on the foil was disconcerting and it was with a sinking heart that i read on the back that vegetable compound was in the list of ingredients  damn  still i pressed on after all it was chocolate it was new to my taste buds and id had to shove an elderly italian nonna out of the way to get it  luckily she wasnt quite five foot tall compared to my five foot seven and it was on the highest shelf so it was an easy victorywell my haste and lack of good manners paid me back in full  this chocolate was gutwrenchingly soulsuckingly awful  overly oily and sickerthansickly sweet with a very strong taste of condensed milk it has been the only chocolate apart from anything labeled compounded that i struggled to not hawk back up onto my deskthe nightmare of receiving a sugarless carob easter egg during my mothers healthnut days in the eighties were a pleasant memory compared to this shocker masquerading as imported quality chocolate  the socalled cereal filling had neither crunch nor identifiable flavours  it resembled a form of cream long past its usebydate with an unnatural somewhat disconcerting additional tang includedthoroughly depressed i broke the remaining block into squares and tried passing it out during our team meeting in the afternoon  all present eyed the chocolate with suspicion why on earth was millymoo sharing chocolate around when she normally inhaled it with the wrapping still on  despite their misgivings the lure of free chocolate won them over and all reached for a squarethe looks on their faces were priceless  helen went grey catherine ran into the kitchen to spit it out and jude remarked that this serves me right for ignoring my high cholesterol restrictions  the others ate it politely the agony clearly etched on their facesit was unanimous  bianco is bad bad badi hope your belief in chocolate is not shaken by this rather dark chapter in confectionary historyim sure a trip to the lindt shop in sydney would bring you back into our midstglad im not the only one who has discovered a bar they cant standhowever epxressed as a percentile of all the chocolate ive ever eaten it still is just a blip a very small blipim reminded of the words said by xander harris in buffy the vampire slayerhow could you let me put this in my mouthhave you ever had a kinder country bar  its the same concept  milk chocolate creamy filling with puffed cereals  its a few tads sweet but i love the puffed cereals  adds a nice roasty flavouri am currently eating bianco cuore concereali chocolates no latte they look like a cherry liquer chocolate nothing like the above chocolate block in the photo i am absolutely loving them too i ate a few last night and couldnt stop i think the cereal filling is superb its crispy sweet and tasty kath try hunting down these sweets im talking about and try them again let us know what you think i think the latte is spoiling yoursits the best choclate ever i love it
so lemon meringue pie wrapped in milk chocolate  can they pull it off silly question reallythe chcolate is of course that wonderfully smooth lindt milk chocolate we know and love but its the filling in these bars that makes it all worthwhile in this case a wonderfully tart lemon cream filling with tiny little fragments of biscuit and meringue floating around in it once again the lindt chocolate wizards have managed to create a creamy filling which accurately recreates a classic dessert in a lindt style the creamy filling has just the right amount of lemony sharpness and once again they have managed to find a way of ensuring that every mouthful contains an evenly distributed amount of meringue and biscuiteating a square of this is a delight to the tastebuds  just like popping a square of chocolate in with a sliver of lemon meringue piei have a petit dessert creme brulee in the fridge at this moment it was meant to be a gift for a friend but youve just forced me to redirect it to my own stomachif you go to a whittard store they have a large range of lindt products ive seen all four of the petits dessert basr youve mentioned on one shelf there beforefor em the meringue just beats the creme brulee but i think thats my citrus loving side coming throughwhere please can i purchase lindt petits desserts tarte citron meringueurgent pleasei found all the petits desserts range in supermarkets in france the have a millefeuille onewow its amazingi cannot find these bars anywhere  i love them  can anyone help me
liquid chocolat is the name of hotel chocolats new drinking chocolate it comes packaged in a plastic bottle with a snazzy looking front label with gold highlights matching the lid which not only tone in very well with the brown hues of the contents but also give the whole thing that touch of poshnow when i was but a mere slip of a lad one of lifes great pleasures was a p cup of hot chocolate from the machine at the swimming baths on a saturday afternoon these days i reckon the same beverage wouldnt be as welcome indeed i rarely partake of a cup of drinking chocolate these days as i find the added sugar makes the whole thing too sickly so when i saw that this stuff promises to be not too sweet my curiosity was well and truly arousedunscrewing the lid and removing the seal revealed the contents  different coloured flakes of pure chocolate which gave off a wonderful cocoa aroma definitely not your average choccy drinkso down to business five yes five spoonfuls of choccy flakes were added to a mugful of milk in a saucepan and the whole lot was gently brought to the boil then allowed to simmer for a minute while i whisked it it wasnt too long before the milk turned a satisfyingly chocolately brown and the smells of cooking cocoa wafted skywards it smells deliciousas it was my first taste i decided against adding any alcohol tempting as it was so as soon as my minute was up i turned it out into my mug and gave it a stir the first taste confirmed that hotel chocolat were of course correct it isnt that sweet at all instead what you get is a subtle yet rich chocolate taste without any of the cloyingly sweet aftertastes other drinking chocolates can have im now looking forward to trying out some of the variations suggested on the hc web siteas youd expect this stuff isnt cheap hotel chocolat produces premium quality goods and as with all good things theres a price to pay having said that it is exceptional a great treat for yourself or for your chocolateaddicted loved onesso temptingwhat a great find for chocolate lovers the chocolate soup idea is intriguing
the chocolate is okay i suppose milk chocolate creamy a little on the sweet side for my tastes fairly unremarkable but edible enough the filling is just a little well dull really unlike the pecan bar which was positively groaning with chunks of caramelised pecan nut this one is shot through with chips of almond which to be honest i found a little annoying instead of an almond or even a decent sized piece of almond i found my mouth being assailed by tiny fragments of the stuffnow i happen to quite like almonds but its a little like eating nuts at christmas  overdo the mouthful and you find yourself lumbered with a load of bits that just dont seem to want to go down once the chocolate had gone i was left with a mouthful of pieces whose sole aim seemed to be to lodge themselves in every nook and cranny available to them and thats just annoyingi think cte dor should stop messing about and let the uks chocolate lovers have a go on the pecan bar this im afraid isnt much to write home about and should be consigned to the failures archive its a very average bar with delusions of grandeur and for the money there are loads of alternatives which offer a good deal more in the way of tastesorry cte dor not a winner with me at allcomments are closed
well soon see i thoughtfor many reasons i was somewhat sceptical about these truffles despite the fact that they contained  cocoa i had been bitten by the nasty nasty ikea chocolate and these were nothing less than proud to be cheap ah well  only one way to find outi was surprised that the package claims no fancy packaging because once you get them out of the outer wrapper these chocs are wrapped in a surprisingly thick foil certainly a good deal more posh than one might expectas for the taste  well that was a surprise these are pretty damned good choccies the milk chocolate is smooth if a little sweet and the filling does a passable imitation of the lindor liquid truffle filling take these out of the bag and pour them into a fancy serving bowl and nobody would know youd spent pennies rather than pounds on themso there you go  expectations confounded and a pleasant surprise from a supermarket chain well worth the money id sayoh wow  im doing a sainsburys perve run i mean shop on wednesday  will def pick some upwill buy one when i drop by
take these thorntons coffee creams for instance theyre made with a middleoftheroad  chocolate which looks a little dull despite the white chocolate decoration the filling is made with real cream and a whopping  coffee but again its nothing specialthe also come in an awful looking cheap plastic bag but the less said about that the betterso perhaps ive been giving thorntons too much of a hard time over their presentation when i should see them for what they are good quality mass produced every day chocolates for granniesim a granny hand over the coffee creamsthis site made me reach for the chocolate under my desk yummythese were from brent crossthanks di miss coffee creams in the big tins at christmas  none of my family like them unlike myself with thorntons however i get a full bag all to myself yay
admittedly its not the most pleasant scene to have to picture but i can only assume it must have happened because this weird looking addition to the terrys family can only be the bastard offspring of such an encounteryes its a chocolate orange bar with pieces of crunchy honeycomb please dont ask me why  i thought it was weird enough when they made chocolate orange into a bar shape in the first place but now it seems theyve just started taking random chocolate bars off a shelf and mixing them upbut the really weird thing is just how well this works its tasty and crunchy and just downright delicious even if i did find myself shaking my head and tuting under my breath while eating itdespite having respectable middle class parents this bar is most definitely not upmarket in fact i could almost feel it trying to jump out of my hand and into a pair of white stilettos and i swear i heard it try to order a babycham earliermaybe thats why i liked itrotf you tartyours is a point of view where real integlilence shines through
the first thing you notice is the rather cheap thin plastic packaging combined with the pastel colours it reminds me of something you might have found in a sweet shop circa as for the chocolates themselves well as you can see they look ok if nothing specialthese chocolates are billed as a mixture of  milk chocolate and  dark chocolate but looking at them its not immediately obvious which is whichbut having said all that theyre really quite tasty theyve obviously been mass produced but the chocolate is quite nice and the fillings are really quite fruity and refreshing the lemon ones in particular have a distinct sherbetytaste that takes me straight back to my childhoodwhen i went into their shop today there were a couple of nicely packaged items but the majority of what was on offer just looked a bit cheap i think thats a bit sad and it makes me wonder how much longer this british institution will survive in its current formi used to love thorntons fruit creams as i reside in canada my mum used to bring them to me but now shes in an old folks home here too is there any way i can get these in toronto they were the best
so this dark chocolate with orange and spices came as something of a pleasant surprise when i got homeaccording to the label maya gold was the first ever product to be awarded the fairtrade mark back in  and its made from organically chocolate grown organically by mayan farmers in belizenow im a bit wary about mass produced organic and fair trade chocolates too often ive found this gets used as a marketing gimmick to sell some rather average quality chocolate but this stuff is niceits  cocoa solids but it doesnt taste that strong and its not at all bitter i think this is partly down to the sweetness of the orange and the spices the orange complements the chocolate flavour perfectly without overwhelming it and the spices are very subtlethe result is a very moreish bar of chocolate that was gone all to quicklyill give yer my address yeahorganic certificate is no way a gimmickhas serious conditions and controls from worldwide assigned control groupsbut thank you for the comment  hd heard and not found this chocolate in my country
having enjoyed nibbling the essential orange bar it was time to crack open its sibling the best ever citrus zest bar it came as something of a surprise to find that this one was shot through with long fine strands of orange lemon and lime zest and i have to say that it was delicious the zest adds much more of a citrus kick to the whole thing and nibbling on the zesty bits after the chocolate had melted was lovely this is my favourite conscious bar to date and i think the addition of a little fruitiness to emmas recipe is a great idea assuming of course that you enjoy citrus flavours definitely a couple of winners here  both recommended but if youre on a tight budget then id say go for the citrus zestfootnote well im just over halfway through my conscious collection and enjoying every mouthful next time ill be reviewing a couple of the more unusual bars  goji  coconut and love potion number the citrus zest sounds perfectly yummy
well mars have recently changed the recipe and design for galaxy so its probably about time we checked it outthe thing that sets galaxy chocolate apart from its similarly priced competitiors has always been the creaminess of the chocolate well mars have used this product refresh to make galaxy even creamier and smoother as you can see from the photo as well theyve also changed the shape of the chunksnow galaxy has always been one of those chocolates that i could take or leave in very small doses  i love it  but as soon as i have more than a few chunks that creaminess starts to turn to sickliness and i just feel illthis new bar is the same except more so the flavour and texture are noticeably creamier than before but somehow that extra creaminess seems to be at the expense of chocolateyness the result for me at least is similar to eating a large bowl of sugary whipped cream  great for the first few mouthfuls but it doesnt take long before you start to feel very sickafter  hours ive managed to eat  chunks of this  chunk g bar and to be perfectly honest i dont think im going to be able to manage the rest todaydont get me wrong galaxy is far too nice to throw away its just that i like my chocolate to taste of chocolate not cream and sugar if youre the kind of person who liked the flavour and texture of the old galaxy im sure youll still like this but for me its just a bit too sweet and a bit too creamysooo truei have to say i totally agree with you i too find galaxy too sweet with very little taste of chocolate i would never consider buying it in one word  cloyingfirst time here and i already love it partly bcoz of my immense love for chocolate and partly due to the beatiful chocolates featured herewish i could eat some of them off herei also tasted it a few days agoi was unimpressed but that did not stop me from eating the whole bar within five minutesgood review i think its less smooth than it was before and the new shape makes it feel like soap in the mouthnot a good move in my opinioni honestly think it tastes the exactly the same it does look sexier thoughi love galaxy  although it could be because i have to import the chocolate orgasmic heaven  seeing that my taste buds must endure the chalky flavor of hersheys the galaxy ripple sent my taste buds into fits of overwhelming orgasmic shivers  i havent had a chance to taste or see the new packaging but what i love about the chocolate is that it does take a while to eat  its more of a savoring chocolate than a gobble it all up sweet  now that i have found this blog i think im in heaven all over againgalaxy flute is the bestare you some kind of light weight i can wolf down a whole galaxy in a matter of secondsi love it its the best in the world exelentamazing there is so meny delicios flavors and shapes they all taste delisios my absalout favoritev amazingi love galaxyomg is so pengi dissagree i could eat a whole bar in one second its like heaven im dying for galaxy hii have a nut allergy and was wondering if you could let me know which of your products are safe for me to eatthanks amylee hedleyo how can you not like this smooth lovely chocolate i have been eating it for years and love the new ones but the shape i think it saves them more money cause there putting less in the chocolate bars they may aswell just give you olny half of one because there is olny half of a bit oh well and its not as good as it was before they should change it back good review thow dd xxsorry marika but galaxy definitely contains vegetable fati agree pretty much wholeheartedly with your review of the new galaxy taste tastes stronger than before which is not a good thing much too sweet and sickly did you know about galaxy counters in a bag from the late sixties and early seventies the round and flat choc sweets that were in revels all the time well there out again in ther own bag but disappointment its the new taste what else aaahhhhwhere can i buy a galaxy fluteplease let me know where will i get galaxy flutes you could get it for bahrainchemicalflavoured chocolate plus way too sugary gagif im not mistaken when i was a teenager in the s galaxy tasted way milkier and more chocolately than now actually i remember how it used to taste back then it tasted of actual chocolate why on earth have they stripped that classic flavour for a new flavour that makes you almost want to gag as its way too sweet hmmmm i dont even wanna know to be fair given how sweet it tastes anyone who hasnt had a galaxy chocolate bar since the s youve been warned lol dont expect the nice tasting chocolate that it once was it now tastes like it was made at a chemical plant i wont be eating this modified rubbish ever again a waste of a childhood memory loli remember eating galaxy chocolate in the s when it was made with full cream milk and it was solid with good natural things since the s the taste has completely changed it is now made with skimmed milk powder and the chunks of the bar have changed  yuk
a little bit of research reveals that this has nothing to do with the jameson whiskey chocolate simon reviewed a while back no this has a far more interesting storyjamesons is actually a brand of a company called monkhill confectionary a little bit more research reveals that monkhill is actually a division of trebor basset ltd which in turn is a wholly owned subsdiary of cadbury schweppes plc yup thats right this weird little bar of chocolate is made by cadbury  not that it says so anywhere on the wrapperthe wrapper describes the filling as coconut and raspberry flavour fondant cream but theres nothing particularly fondanty or creamy about it its quite solid and very dry  almost crumbly it doesnt taste bad its just not what it says it is on the labelindeed thats my biggest problem with the bar as a whole  its just not quite what it says it is it looks great  but somehow doesnt quite live up to the promisean interesting curiosity but probably not something ill buy twiceback in the s these were the sweets you bought at the end of the week when your pocket money ws running out i cant recall the exact price but it may have been a shiny penny after all a mars was four pence  new penceback in the s these were the sweets you bought at the end of the week when your pocket money was running out i cant recall the exact price but it may have been a shiny penny after all a mars was four pence  new penceim reading your weblog for a while now and i think youre doing a great job im also a chocolate addict and everytime i see the pictures on your blog i want to eat only more chocolate hahaha btw this one looks delicious to me xoxo tatjanasorry i have to disagree with your reviewruffle bars are yum i used to get them as a treat as a kid but the good thing now is that on tasting them now i am not disappointed they still taste raspberry coconutty and with a touch of dark chocolate to cut the sweetness the other great thing is that there is no dairy so great for allergy sufferers try them and seeoohhh you have ruffled my chocolatey feathers i totally adore these funny little bars of raspberry delight when i was on a nondairy wheat or anything fun diet the only thing that kept me going was dark chocolate usually frys creme green and black and yes youve guessed it raspberry ruffle bars the diets long gone but my pleasure in these eccentric little bars remains  blissthese were more popular than you might think i remember the individual chocs in the dark red cellophane useful for school projects after  honest dadin the s and also the bars later which i still enjoy now there was even a lemonlime variety of the bar a sort of dayglo colour from i think the mid s to about the mid sabout yrs ago after christmas i found a huge selection box in leicester market with raspberry lemonlime and orange ruffle chocolates i do remember orange being further off the suitability scale than lemonlime though not as terrible as some may say or imagineupdate i just checked myself and the bags of ruffle chocs still available in supermarkets even if the bars seem to be disappearing do indeed state plain chocolate contains minimum  cocoa solidsi just tried a raspberry truffle chocolate piece it wasnt a truffle at all but more like coconut shavings that taste like raspberry i still liked it considering i love coconut and the raspberry flavour was a bonus i live in canada and someone got them for me from england so im not sure where i can get them againrosita this is a raspberry ruffle not a raspberry truffle i dont think its meant to be trufflelike at allas for buying them in canada your best bet is probably to find somewhere online that sells it and delivers to canadathese have been around for donkeys years since the s at least i would imagine theyre much much older than thatnothing to do with cadbury anymore theyre now produced in blackpool by tangerine confectionary who bought the brand from cadbury in another small brand thats been pushed from pillar to post over the decades but so nice to find them still being made iceland retail them at  for is this chocolate bar really vegan i have never seen in around so may only available online like amazonwhere can i get these sweets from in the uki love these as conegirl said eccentric little bars and first bought one as we had a dog called ruffles and have always been slightly addicted to them
wispa is very very simple cadbury milk chocolate tiny bubbles in it so listen carefully here comes the science bitmost of us eat chocolate regularly and we may even check the ingredients when looking for the best chocolate experience but did you know the shape of your chocolate can affect the taste almost as much as the ingredientsall those tiny little bubbles in wispa increase the surface area massively and mean the chocolate starts to melt almost as soon as it hits your mouth the result is that this fairly standard milk chocolate just feels creamier and more satisfying than a solid blockso was it worth bringing back well yes absolutely wispa may just be dairy milk with holes in it but those holes completely change the texture and taste of the chocolate you shouldnt expect wispa to suddenly be something wonderful just because cadbury brought it back from the dead its still just a fairly average looking and tasting bar of chocolate but its certainly one deserves its place on the supermarket shelves bring back fusedid you ask cadbury do do that  and did they refusethe problem is they defused and wont refuse so now im confusedbring back wispa gold i loved them as much as the wispaim with you there wispa gold was gorgeous second only to wispa bite of coursewhere can i buy in boxes of wispasbring back cadbury fuse pleeeeeasei havent seen a wispa around again lolwispa mint was the bestyep it deffo was im craving one now damn pyou need to launch a new campaign  wispas have disappeared again i want the wispa bite back againpleeese bring back wispa mint i can taste it now mmmmi love these and i was wondering do they sell wispa mints in irelandeuropethe wispa bar really bores me its so overated and i would much rather have a crunchie or a picnic which are both bars that cadbury have mastered brilliantlyit is true that the texture and shape of chocolate can determine its flavour however wispa also contains different amounts of milk and cocoa to dairy milk wispas are fantastic im totally hooked
as i have ten conscious chocolate bars to get through i know poor old me i thought it might be fair to group them for ease of reviewing and to save space on the site this first pair are the hot ones  best ever chilli hot and fiery hazelnutmy first taste was of the fiery hazelnutrecommended if you like it spicy but definitely not for the faint heartedthe chilli hot is as far as i can ascertain the best ever plain blend with added chilli for that spicy kick after a taste of the fiery hazelnut i must confess to a degree of apprehension when it came to unwrapping this bar a cautious sniff or two and then it was time to take the plungenow i dont know if the fiery hazelnut had just nuked my taste buds or whether this batch was low on chilli oil but it seemed very mild in comparison i even waited a few hours and went back for another taste but there was still nothing like the tonguetingling heat of the hazelnut bar it certainly has a hint of the ol chilli about it but nothing like i expectedof the two id say i preferred the fiery hazelnut simply because it seemed to do a lot more of what it was supposed to  ie put a fire in your mouth and a slight sheen of sweat on your forehead the chilli bar would probably suit the first time chili and chocolate eater whereas the fiery hazelnut is for those of you who like a bit of periperi or a good dollop of chili sauce on your kebabsanother thing to note is that the more of this stuff i eat the more i like it the conscious range is tasty nutritious and well good for you cant really argue with that can wewould you happen to know what percentage of the chocolates you review are available in canada
emma jackman for it is she who makes the chocolate has come up with a basic recipe for her bars and produces variants by adding a variety of nuts seeds fruits and essences to her base resulting in a total of ten different barsi tested this one out on three people personally i found the bar to have a slightly earthy taste which detracted from the otherwise agreeable taste of emmas chocolate base however my two cotasters were very much in favour and were happy to polish off the bar on my behalf proof that taste is very much subjectiveas mentioned in my first review this stuff is actually very good for you because the ingredients are raw and organic and prepared at low temperatures the final product is rich in antioxidants and magnesium contains  nutritional compounds and the sugars are  fructosei have to say that i prefer the best ever plain bar over this one but having looked at the rest of the selection im very much looking forward to cracking open the next oneconscious is apparently also available at londons borough market by the way so now you have two reasons to head down to london bridgecomments are closed
the first thing that hits you when you see the bournville deeply dark range on the supermarket shelf is the influence of green  blacks the thick paper wrapper and clean design look so much more appealing than the standard plasticfoil wrappingand when you get it home you find that inside that expensive looking wrapping is a an equally appealing foil wrapper and a rather attractive looking bar of chocolatethe answer is emphatically yes this is real chocolate   with caramelised cocoa nibs and coffee which add both flavour and a slight crunch to the bar the coffee taste is strong without being overpowering and theres a slight sweetness from the caramelised cocoa nibs it is in fact rather deliciousit seems this is an attempt by cadbury to push the bournville brand up market without having to use the expensive ingredients of the green  blacks range and im not altogether comfortable with thatbut none of that changes the fact that this really is a pretty tasty bar of chocolate and at exactly  for this g bar the price isnt bad eithertea coffee cola energy drinks and chocolate share the same nerve toxin stimulant caffeine caffeine which is readily released into the blood triggers a powerful immune response that helps the body to counteract and eliminate this irritant the toxic irritant stimulates the adrenal glands and to some extent the bodys many cells to release the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol into the blood streamif consumption of stimulants continues on a regular basis however this natural defense response of the body becomes overused and ineffective the almost constant secretion of stress hormones which are highly toxic compounds in and of themselves eventually alters the blood chemistry and causes damage to the immune system endocrine and nervous systems future defense responses are weakened and the body becomes more prone to infections and other ailmentsthe boost in energy experienced after drinking a cup of coffee is not a direct result of the caffeine it contains but of the immune systems attempt to get rid of it caffeine an overexcited and suppressed immune system fails to provide the energizing adrenaline and cortisol boost needed to free the body from the acidic nerve toxin caffeine at this stage people say that they are used to a stimulant such as coffee so they tend to increase intake to feels the benefitssince the body cells have to sacrifice some of their own water for the removal of the nerve toxin caffeine regular consumption of coffee tea or colas causes them to become dehydrated for every cup of tea or coffee you drink the body has to mobilize  cups of water just to remove the stimulants a luxury it cannot afford this applies to soft drinks medicinal drugs and any other stimulants as a rule all stimulants have a strong dehydrating effect on the bile blood and digestive juicesdom can you please remove the above fearmongering commentmoderation is the key susans stress inducing rant may cause more physiological issues than caffeinethanks good articlefor every cup of tea or coffee you drink the body has to mobilize  cups of water just to remove the stimulants a luxury it cannot afford so umdrink more water oexactly all things in moderation particularly all chocolatey thingsi dont think ill remove the initial comment now  because the rest wouldnt make sense if i did can i still buy bournville drink anymoredoes anyone know where you can buy it it is my favourite chocolate bar but tesco have stopped doing it at least locally in scarborough have looked on line even
the chocolate is smooth not too dark and delicious and each nut is lightly dusted with what seems to be icing sugarfoolishly i only bought home one bag and their stay in my house was all too brief everyone who tried one wanted one more and then one morei suppose ill have to wait for australian homemade to open up shop in the uk or get some more work in hollandaustralian homemade has landed in the uk they are located in the glades shopping centre in bromley kentfab  thanks for the news and well spotted get in therehmmmmb its true when will these  chocolates be available in the usa
smores bars are billed as graham crackers topped with a delicious marshmallow and hand dipped in luscious milk chocolate i really had no idea what to expect with these and when they arrived i was a little worried the bars come in a thin plastic bag  per pack and had been squashed into a single lumpafter spending a few minutes separating the bars i decided to take the plunge and take a bite  now chocablog and us chocolates dont generally get along all that well more often than not american chocolate is far too sweet and loaded with so much artificial junk that it comes out with a closer resemblance to candle wax than real chocolatebut somehow sweet sweet confections has managed to produce a rather tasty milk chocolate here theres plenty of it and it actually tastes like real chocolatemy only minor issue with smores bars is that the marshmallow is a bit firm with a  gelatinous texture rather than soft and fluffy now that could be partly down to having traveled half way around the world in a thin plastic bag but i think its partly by design tooaside from that these are really quite tasty this clearly isnt gourmet chocolate but its pretty damn tasty as far as the chocolate itself is concerned its some of the nicest american milk chocolate ive tasted recentlycomments are closed
just south of the city of london lies borough market home to a bewildering and sometimes frighteningly expensive range of gastronomic delights from organically farmed meat to imported wines ostrich cheeses and of course chocolate nestling among the plethora of stalls you will find one that groans with an amazing array of fine handmade chocolates  dark sugarsthe second trip was much more successful  i came away clutching a small sample bag containing a handful of the more esoteric flavours on offer and it is these that i will reviewi chose what i thought were seven different flavours but in fact i discovered that i only had a half dozen missing out on the gin  lime truffle so expect further reportage in the near futurewhat i did manage to acquire weredark truffle centre containing tiny pieces of orange zest and the subtle flavour of vodka deliciously warming to the palate and as far as i am aware uniquetastes like a lovely home made apple pie  bursting with apple flavours and finished off with a warming hint of cinnamon another first for me and a real pleasurethe first time ive come across these two flavours in combination and they work beautifully the honeyed chocolate truffle melts on the tongue and the morsels of stem ginger provide a subtly fiery top note sweet and spicy and very moreishagain the combination of flavours is another first tangy zesty orange complimented with the unique taste of cardomom a real pleasureif dark sugars had to have a flagship truffle then i would nominate this one not only is it unique in my experience but the flavour is something else i would never have considered tobacco to be something one could add to a truffle but this little beauty really blew me away a triumph of imagination and daring bravoa dark chocolate coated truffle which delivers a wonderfully subtle lemon tea flavour the first tea truflle i have had and definitely not the lastof course handmade chocolates are not cheap but i would seriously recommend trying these to any chocolate lover they have a mail order service available so geography is no boundary to the enjoyment of truffles that have obviously been made with a great deal of love and enthusiasmtobacco tobaccobetter believe it old bean whats more it tastes amazing and is one of their best sellersi love these but i have to say that lartisan du chocolat on the otherside of borough market is even betterhiya i am a fanatic of good quality cocoa rich chocolate  last saturday i bought a selection of truffles from the darksugars stall in borough market and was sadly disappointed  the chocolate itself is of high quality but the different flavours nondistinguishable i tried them out on my friends also aficionados of fine chocolate and they too were hard pressed to distinguish the flavours  such a shame  i tried the website but there appears to be a problem with access
i had spied this on the shelf a couple of times and was considering a purchase but the addition of a  reduction finally tipped the scales and i brought one home this very afternoona limited edition bar is a funny thing  either you bemoan the fact you cant find it any more or it gets largely ignored and quickly forgotten i must admit to being slightly dubious about this bar anyway hence me passing it by a couple of times after all it could just be a flat bounty barim very happy to report that this is not the casethe bar consists of little milk chocolate pillows each of which contains a delicious coconut cream filling with a few flakes of real coconut suspended in it  enough to give texture but not so many that they end up finding every nook and cranny in your molars  la bountyi recommend that uk readers go out and buy in a couple before they become extinct and at  off theyre well worth ithow do you add a  reduction  when will the coconut limited edition bar become unavailablei really love it and only tried it yesterdayplease dont make it limited  its too good for thatsuck on it oh yeah
these cookies are pretty much what youd expect looking at the bag random chunks of cookie coated in milk chocolatemy opninon of these is pretty much the same as the others in the range theyre ok but really nothing specialthe cookie pieces are a little dry for my liking and have a strange slightly artificial taste that i cant quite put my finger on the closest comparison to something we get in the uk would be a digestive biscuit  except not quite as nice theyre not the kind of cookie id want to eat if they werent covered in chocolateand thats just about all i have to say about these klick cookie sums up the whole range of klik products for me  theyre ok and its a novelty having chocolates that say made in israel on them the packaging is very colourful and theyre a bit different from anything ive had beforebut they dont quite manage to hide the fact that theyre obviously mass produced and i dont think i can really justify the fact that this chocolate travelled  miles to get to mecomments are closed
as far as i can tell kraft dont officially sell these in the uk although i did find it in my local corner shop i suspect the shopkeeper snuck a load into his bag in a duty free shop somewhere in europethe bar is simple very simple a thick stick of  milk chocolate with lots of whole hazelnuts in it now im not the biggest fan of hazelnut and this bar just didnt do anything for mefor what it is this bar isnt bad but i cant help wondering why kraft have taken a wonderful upmarket brand like cte dor and turned it into something so dull and unappealingfor what it is a cheapo chocolate and nut bar its perfectly ok but it shouldnt be carrying the cte dor logo and i dont think ill be buying this one againcomments are closed
i seem to have reached the point where friends and colleagues have started to recommend chocolate to metake this bar for example i have a friend who has been trying to follow a healthier diet and so hes been a frequent visitor to his local health food shop a while ago he told me about this bar of chocolate hed tried which used raw foodswell sure enough he came through last week cheers rob and i received this in the postthe history of the company is pretty interesting  founded by a yoga teaching raw food lover whose friends were bringing her delicacies back from all over the world a desire to produce a healthy product testing out new recipes on festival goers and so on the packaging is recycled naturally and the site makes very interesting reading if you want to know more about the ingredients and their propertiesso what about the productwell i was advised that the bars tend to melt rather quickly so it was popped in the fridge for the afternoon prior to tasting  once opened i didnt have to get too close to the bar to be able to smell it this stuff advertises its presence the bar is very dark obviously handmade and smells of rich dark cocoa with a hint of sweetness it lacks any of the shiny glossy looks that one generally associates with high cocoa content chocolate and i assume that this is because it hasnt been heated during the manufacturing process its almost matt black and when broken it reveals a dark brown interioronce you pop a piece of this stuff in your mouth you really get to find out just how different it is to normal chocolate it melts incredibly quickly flooding your tongue with dark subtle flavours of cocoa and cocoa butter and with a surprising kick of salt following alongside to temper the sweetness its very rich and smooth with a slight grainyfibrous texture on the tongue presumably the carobi can safely say that this is quite unlike any other chocolate bar i have ever tasted and the best news of all is that it is but one of ten bars that emma the chocolatier has produced eating this stuff is unlike any chocolate experience ive had before and i can only put this down to the unique ingredients and methods of production the bars are made at quite low temperatures so as to preserve the essential qualities of the ingredients and as theyre all handmade you know youre getting premium quality stuff herethe bad news is that this stuff is possibly the most expensive bar i have ever eaten and as you know ive been through some posh chocolate in my timeim looking forward to sampling more of conscious chocolates wares so look out for more reviews very soonid like to finish with a small quote from ccs website  something all chocoholics will take heart fromconscious chocolate is made from the best most pure ingredients and acts as a superfood  feeding the body with essentials fats vitamins and minerals what joy chocolate that is good for you that can be eaten any time of the day  yes even breakfast  to help get through a heavy work or training schedule or even just for fun and keep you smiling throughoutworth the price of admission alonei love raw chocolate yum this chocolate bar sounds divine  ive not tried it yet and now im on the hunt to get one   i have a delicious raw chocolate mousse recipe on my blog that you might enjoy come on over for a visitdont you just love it when a plain comes togetherwould someone comment on thisare you a representative of hersheysi dont know anywhere to buy hersheys powder but i may try it with green  blacks or twinings if i can find agave syrupi use to mix in buckwheat honey until i read where agave nectar was better than honeyand no i dont work for agave nectarahh yes but la is a bit of a hike from berkshire englandtheres the rubas dollar is dropping you could fly to us and buy a pound of unsweetened hershey cocoa and fly home and still have money left over
there can be no doubting the pedigree of this particular chocolate family as both myself and dom have agreed that petits desserts are perhaps some of the yummiest chocolate to be found weve both waxed lyrical over the quality of the ingredients and tried our best to convey to you the sublime taste sensations to be had from these bars so i was obviously delighted to find that there are more of these admittedly i did have to go to holland to find itthe box promises a mix of milk and dark chocolate with chocolate truffle cream and crisp biscuit pieces and thats exactly what you get the chocolate itself is as one would expect  meltingly lovely creamy rich and divine in ways that other bars of that name would do well to imitate  and the truffle cream is just so rich dark and downright naughty that its hard to stop eating this one the biscuit pieces are like the tiramisu bar tiny but add a lovely crunchy element to the whole taste experiencenow although this bar is a work of art i felt that it didnt quite live up to the promise of its predecessors but in hindsight i think ive been spoiled by having tasted the other two first the fact that lindt managed to perfectly capture the tastes and textures of two classic desserts in chocolate bar form means that something like this seems a little well ordinary in comparison this is not to say that this chocolate bar is anything other than delicious just that it isnt as excitingstill well worth a go for the truffle cream filling  its definitely exceedingly good cakewhere did you get this from simon ive seen one in waitrose and a few of these online but at very steep pricesoh wait holland i need to learn how to readin france i believe they are around  euros that is say around  a bar
the poor bar looked so lonely and out of place surrounded by common mars bars and the constantly growing if slightly chavy dairy milk family i immediately decided to adopt young tiramisu knowing i could give her a better lifein my tummyand i have to say this bar is completely deserving of its new home in my stomach because its utterly delicious i dont know how but lindt have managed to make a tiramisu flavoured chocolate bar that actually tastes of real tiramisuthe chocolate is of course wonderful being lindt its a milk chocolate with  cocoa solids but the real star of the show is the filling which somehow manages to be both soft  light and rich  crunchy at the same timeim not entirely sure how lindt manage to cram so much flavour in texture into such a small thin square of chocolate but i assume some kind of magic is involved somewhere along the linethe crunchiness comes from tiny pieces of biscuit which are so small that they shouldnt work in theory yet somehow they dothe unfortunate consequence of all this is that this young bar did not have a particularly long life but you can rest assured it was a happy one  for me at leasti think i can best sum up lindt petit desserts tiramisu in three words i want morei tasted both of these while in st lo france and i must agree with your viewpoint theyre greati want to be a chocoblogger i just bought a box of lindt petits desserts chocolates christmas season thats the only reason they had them at my local tesco for the steep price of  they all taste absolutely delicious but my favourite ones are crme brle and tiramisui am looking for it where   where   where 
a quick look at the package seems to indicate that the only difference between this and a normal toblerone is the addition of  raisins something which can hardly be classed as a radical departure for toblerkraft it also rather begs the question why bother  toblerone is what it is  milk chocolate almonds and those little fragments of nougat that home in on gaps and dents in your teeth and clump there for slowrelease enjoyment long after the chocolate is but a distant memorythe taste test seems to confirm just that  its a toblerone but with raisins looks smells and tastes just like the ordinary toblerone but occasionally you come across a nice juicy raisin to nibble on hardly radical though  a bit like putting honeycomb in a mars bar its still essentially a mars bar but with an added taste you werent expecting and which doesnt have a great effect on the overall taste of the productpersonally i think the difference here is so negligible that its unlikely that kraft will se a sudden surge in sales of this product of course too radical a departure would either alienate toblerone lovers or just render the product untobleronelikeso my verdict is that unless you really really have a thing for raisins stick to the original toblerone its been around forever and it isnt brokenhi you simply must try a strawberry kitkatif you knew me youd know i cant stand strawberry flavoured anything wouldnt mind a pumpkin or green tea one thoughnot a kitkat fan myself but i think i want to try a pumpkin and green tea toblerone nowi am dying to try the new fruit and nut toblerone they keep advertising it and its driving me mad because i cant find it anywhereif anyone in uk knows where i can get it please let me knowthanksplease can you tell me the name of the music on your fruit and nut advert i like is as much as tobleronegot my fruit and nut toblerone from my local coop store  in the process of becoming veggie  not exactly sure if this product is totally okay for veggies though has egg white but not sure if made from battery hen eggs or not  anyone knowi got one of these at christmas and for some reason the purple on the packaging really puts me off eating it theres no reason to i just dont think purple and chocolate go together ptell that to cadburysi gave one of these to my mum for christmas she adores toblerone but hasnt touched it yet i really want to try some as i love toblerone tooi bought a toblerone fruit and nut in april and loved it  i wish i could get them in the us  i keep asking my friends in switzerland to send them to me  love love love iti love the fruit and nut toblerone for me it is the ultimate chocolate taste combination the king of chocolateonde posso encontrar este chocolate fruit and nut toblerone  no brasili love the fruity filling my boss gave me a whole box of thesei think am gonna have cavities pretty soonwink wink
however when the time came to open it up and have a taste i discovered i had committed something of a faux pas i attempted to eat this bar at room temperature which wasnt just a mistake  it was very amusing the bar was so soft it had become impossible to snap along the guides and i was left holding what appeared to be a rubber bar bending it to and fro and giggling at the way the bar just refused to give of course i shoved it straight into the freezer for half an hour or so and upon my return i was rewarded with a much better behaved barnow my bendy bar experience had already given me a pretty good idea of what to expect from this chocolate but i still wasnt prepared for just how amazingly soft and creamy the filling of this bar is it is quite simply divine as soon as you bite into it the square of chocolate begins to melt away releasing the fondant filling which is pretty much like the chocolate itself  smooth rich creamy and dangerously moreish if you intend to share this bar buy more than one and if youre eating it alone  well buy more than one its not cheap chocolate but its damned good chocolateonce again lindt have come up trumps and created something unique and incredibly tasty  i believe i have already credited their chocolatiers with supernatural powers and this bar does nothing to dispel that opinion another winner from the swissyes lindt is the holy grail of all things chocolate but to my mind that bar looks like a flattened out lindt ball not that theres anything wrong with thatbuying two goes without sayingi became addicted to these while in st lo france i find the bars are rather nicer than the ballsplease can you tell me if lindt chocolate contains alcahol
personally i like the malty taste of maltesers but these dont really have that distinct flavour theyre very crunchy and the chocolate is pretty good but the centres taste of nothing much at all theyre made of a similar honeycombe to maltesers but they taste more like a biscuiti liki klik malt ballsmalt balls are pretty much theyre very crunchy and the chocolate is pretty good but the centres taste of nothing much at allthank you thank you i love you you are so sweet to me mocha flavored malt balls where the heck did you find those baeibs i want em thank you again for the shout out you are so sweet to try my recipes it really makes my day i always show ffh your posts he loves the way you didi his chicken
as any regular reader will no doubt be aware i always try and keep an eye out for unusual or different types of chocolate when im on my travels im proud to continue this tradition by reviewing this bar of milk chocolate from    walesyes caldey island chocolate is made in the monastery on caldey islandunfortunately i didnt actually go to the monastery this bar was bought from the gift shop at the welsh parliament building in cardiff as you can see from the photos it comes in a pleasant enough gold and brown coloured paper sleeve  with a rather interesting and very decorative foil wrapper around the actual bar itselfthe rear of the wrapper promises a minimum of  cocoa and  milk solids so i was anticipating a good creamy milk chocolate i was not disappointed upon opening the wrapper i was immediately impressed with the smell of the chocolatei dont suppose the monks of caldey island make huge quantities of chocolate and nor do i imagine that this is widely available even in wales but i would recommend it to anyone who happens to spy a bar while visiting walesbloody hell simon you sure do get around a bit italian chocolate pasta lindt bars from europe guiness stuff from irelandwherever nextoh i have  few surprises left up my somewhat sticky sleeve  hi guys i started reading your blog just last week and it is addictive anyway i noticed that you have never reviewed japanese chocolates meiji and lotte are the big brands i think i just dont know if you can get them in the uk just a thoughtive got a huge bunch of japanese reviews on my website terry checking out your japanese reviewsadding your web site to my usual fare too thanksarigatou gozaimasuindeed the chocolate is delicious howeveron a recent trip to caldey chocolate factory i could not see any monks actually making the chocolate but instead a few ladies and a very young man still considering the trade descriptions act it is made on the island but whether the chocolate is made by the monks at some time is perhaps another matter to be confirmedhi i am across your blog and thought it was very interesting that caldey had reached a blog i have a strong connection with the island and can confirm that they do make they chocolate monks have very tight timetables to stick to including prays at  am therefor cannot be expected to run everything  it is amazing tho isnt it and just goes to show its not all about the big industrial places just to let you all know that i work in the chocolate factory in caldey sorry to disappoint but the chocolate isnt made by the monks on caldey however it is made by myself and my boss who is actually a resident on caldey island the chocolate is widely available on caldey and online and in select stores throughout the country we also produce fudge that is exclusively available on caldey i hope this clears things up a bit ps it is also nice to see that we are actually getting reviews on the chocolate aswell
my recent visit to ireland yielded a few items some of which were of course made by butlers irishwhilst enjoying a drink in one of their shops i bought myself a jamesons truffle bar and then when i visited the jamesons distillery in middleton i came across some individual truffles also flavoured with jamesons whiskey and strangelyalso made by butlers irish sounds like another chocolate faceoff to mean obvious first observation is that the truffles are somewhat posher than the bar as reflected in both quantity and price the bar costs a little less than the box of truffles and contains six or seven segments whereas the jamesons truffles box contains just four gold foil wrapped truffles nestling in little petits fours casesboth bar and truffles claim the same cocoa content  and so it would be natural to expect that the two products would taste very similar however this is plainly not the case the bar is a fairly uniform texture the truffle part being a little softer than the chocolate but nowhere near the texture of the truffle in the errm trufflesthe difference in texture with the four truffles was quite amazing because the truffles were individual balls sealed in chocolate they seemed to retain a smooth moistness that the truffle bar just couldnt approach consequently the truffles deliver a much fuller and more rounded taste than the bar the chocolate used in the truffles seems darker glossier and much more bittersweet than the stuff wrapped around the baralthough they do cost more the truffles are so much tastier than the bar that its hard to believe that the two products are essentially cut from the same cloth i dont know if the fact that the truffles may be hand made unlike the bar but i know which one i preferred the truffle bar is definitely a poor secondcomments are closed
the half in the name doesnt seem to mean halffat or halfsugar or even halfchocolate instead it seems to just refer to the halfspeherical shape of these cute little trufflestheyre vey small  about cm across  and pretty basic white chocolate with soft truffley filling but id hardly cally them gourmet in fact i dont think ive ever seen a chocolate that looks quite as much like its come off a production line as this they look more like mass produced white plastic bullets than anything hand madeim not sure id buy these and just eat them out of the bag but i might buy several bags at once and either stick them in a big bowl to serve at parties or sprinkle them on top of a nice chocolate ice cream mmmmtheyre very attractive i have to say
we dont often review supermarket bakery stuff but as im currently sitting here with a mouthful of shortbread and a nice cup of tea i thought i may as well write about itthese four large chocolate chip shortbread cookies set me back  which i thought was a little expensive when i bought them having actually eaten one and a bit  mmm and a bit more ive decided theyre worth the priceits quite tough to get a feel for the quality of chocolate in these despite looking like theyre loaded with choc chips theyre not particularly chocolatey in taste the triple choc is obviously white milk and dark but its impossible to pick out the individual flavoursbut the shortbread is simply delicious its soft and smooth and melts away in your mouth from the moment you bite into it its not too sweet but as with any shortbread its quite filling and can leave your mouth a little dry  so you do need that nice cup of tea to go with itim not sure id go out of my way to pick these up but if youre passing the bakery section in tesco theyre definitely worth a tryyum  shortbread especially when made in the uk and not via an aussie factory is always sensational and i keep reminding myself that its actually got about as much fat in it as chocolate the good stuff anyway so its a rather nice choice to havethese are deliciousive had these and once tried instantly wished i hadnt brandished the bag when i came in i wanted the lot myself they are so yummy quite expensive like you say but a gorgeous treat if you luuuurve shortbread i doim eating one right at this moment 
i seem to find myself returning to the world of cte dor with frightening regularity they make some damned fine products and i think ive developed a sixth sense for their packagingnow pecans just happen to be my second favourite nuts ever after macadamias of which more another time so it didnt take long before i was walking out of the shop with this little prizealthough the majority of my reviews still centre around the dark stuff im not averse to good quality milk chocolate and i was pretty confident that this one would deliver and i was right its creamy soft milky and delicious and i was both surprised and delighted to find that the pecans had been lightly caramelised prior to their inclusion in the bar giving them a delightfully crispy textureof course there is a generous nuttochoc ratio the trend seems to be to cram as many nutscherriesraisins into a bar as possible and so you get a lovely mouthful of nutty choccy crispiness the chocolate works wonderfully with the pecans assuming you like pecans of course and being continental i was spared the ridiculous product may contain nuts warninglovely stuff  please release it into the uk mr dorwow your pick looks just like the package i love pecans and they do go very well with good milk chocolatethis used to be for sale in tescos but was withdrawn a couple of years ago a good thing for my weight but a bad thing for my sanity ive just come back from a holiday in france where you can still buy this chocolate and obviously i did it also comes as a dark chocolate form which is inferior in my opinion  the milk choc works so much better with those caramelised pecans  yum please can someone sell it in the ukany idea if this is for sale in the uk now  its sooooooooooooooo good
ohnuts are us based so these choccies have pretty much traveled around the world to end up in my stomach sometimes im amazed how much trouble chocolate takes to get to my stomach it must really like meid never heard of klik before so i presume this is an israelonly brand although they are apparently made by unilever bestfoods best known for hellmans mayonnaise it seemsluckily these dont taste of mayonnaise at all they are little pillows of wafer coated in milk chocolate they also apparently have a nougat filling but theres not very much of it and the pillows are pretty much hollowthe chocolate is pretty good quality the bag lists it as minimum  cocoa solids and the wafer is nice and crispy but thats pretty much all there is to theseim going to keep this review quite short as i have  more products from the klik range to review and im getting hungry againonde posso adquirir kariot pillowsprovei e gosteigratowilson carvalhoomg those are the best ever im from israel and i love the sweets there yum
like wispa aero is simply chocolate with bubbles in it but the bubbles in aero are much bigger than those in wispa which gives it more of a crumbly than a velvety textureas if to emphasise its lack of fashion sense aero at least here in the uk comes in an oldskool foil wrapper with a paper sleeve i think i actually prefer this to the cheap plastic wrappers most chocolate bars come in but maybe thats just because im getting oldupon unwrapping youre greeted by a fairly thick bar of chocolate divided into chunks each stamped with the aero logo unfortunately if you try to break the bar along these chunks its likely to crumble and send small pieces of chocolate flying into the eyes of anyone in the room at least thats what happened to mine admittedly it had been stored in the fridge but even so if theyre going to divide it into chunks they should at least be ones that allow you to break the bar into pieces without injuring small childrenthe taste is well typical nestl chocolate in other words its very average sometimes i wonder why nestl dont just change their name to the decidedly average chocolate company and be done with it its not bad but its certainly nothing special id personally rank cadbury and even mars chocolate above thisand the bubbles just dont quite do it for me either they add a bit of texture and make the bar quite light but they just dont taste bubblyhaving said all that you can bet that if aero was discontinued the campaign to bring it back would be even bigger than the wispa campaign i think its just one of those bars you need to see on the shelf on the sweet shop to let you know the world hasnt ended just yet its not really for me but i think a small part of me would die if it wasnt there waiting for me to er not buy itmore adscant stand the big aero bars but the little mini ones you get in variety bags are okay  maybe because you eat them in two bites before you can really taste how bland the chocolate really is roll on wispa daymy grandad loved those he loved the fruit and nut and turkish delight ones they were made by cadbury before  branded nestl cadbury before  so dont make those silly comments ever againplease please make a dark choc version of aero save on my high bp and beloveds cholesterol x
now i know peanut butter cups are an american institution but ive never seen them in the uk before  and i dont think i ever even had them when i was living in the states so this is a first for mecups are like little cupcakes of milk chocolate with a peanut butter filling they even come in a little paper case they certainly look quite tasty and well madethe peanut butter filling is very smooth very light very nutty and  unfortunately  very very sweet it could be delicious but like so many american chocolates they seem to have just gone overboard on the sugarthe sweetness of the peanut butter kind of overwhelmes the chocolate to the point that you cant really taste it but i suspect its only there to hold the filling together anywayif you can get past the sweetness these are quite tasty im just not sure i can get past it  i was initially disappointed that there were only three cups per pack but having eaten all three i dont think i could manage any more  theyre just too sweeti tasted these several years ago and was terribly disappointed i expected the filling to be peanut butter and instead it was that awful stuff youve describedi actually love them i used to sit down and eat a whole bag o the miniature version while watching movies at home but later i grew tired of them after eating godiva chocolates i dont see chocolate the same wayi went to taiwan for a summer a few years ago and while i was there completely lost my taste for all candy bars american or not with a few exceptions the reeses cups i usually buy taste more salty in the middle than sweet but still theyre not made of either highquality chocolate or highquality peanut butter every once in a while i try a candy bar i havent had before last month i had the elviscommemorative bananaflavored reeses cups which were so sweet i could feel the back of my throat burning before that i tried jaffa bars which i swear nearly killed me i dont understand how anyone could eat that much sugar i quit at a fourth of a packageyou definitely want to try the miniature ones they are much betteru have good candyin the us they only come with two per package i love themthere so good and healthy as well because of the protein from the peanut butter you got to try them
now i have mixed feelings about galaxy i love it but only in small doses its a little too creamy to eat in a large bar and starts to get a little sickly if you eat too much dairy milk however i can pretty eat all day without noticingbut this bar is just the right size to get the best galaxy experience and the ripples really do add to that the thin layers of chocolate and the gaps in between somehow make it even more delicousthe one thing i would say about this bar is that it doesnt crumble quite like a flake does presumably because the creamier chocolate is that little bit softer im sure putting this in the fridge for a while would help hereif youre a fan of galaxy or flake then youll definitly like this ive added it to my evergrowing buy this again listgalaxy ripple is nestls answer to cadburys flake or more accurately twirlcorrect me if im wrong but arent galaxy a subsidiary of masterfoods the guys who also own mars thats what i thought at leastno youre quite right im not entirely sure what i was thinking of when i wrote thatsadly i find these burn my throattheyre just soooo sweetsweet justicethankyou domhow anyone can eat cadburys i just dont know its dreadful stuff  trash tastes like it was made with sour milk galaxy  now thats yummy my friend in japan yuh has never had galaxy and im going to take her some next time i go  shes going to go nuts for itim addicted to ripples w el o v er i p p l e s world market has them i bought one todayi love ripplesalthough i find galaxy chocolate far too sickly i prefer this to a flake perhaps its the way the bar is createdripples are superb  times better than cadburys flake and best of all my local asda are selling them at the moment  in a pack for oh yes lovely does anyone know when galaxy ripples fist went on sale in the uk i find the texture pretty light on my stomach which is important for me as i get bloated too easily lighter bars are easier on digestion i like these better than the cadbury flake
flying home from a trip is usually a good time for me to hunt for chocolate and it was at eindhoven airport that i came across australian homemade my first thought was that it was somewhat bizarre to be discovering aussie chocolate in a dutch airport sandwich shop but the truth was to prove even more bizarreysee folks australian homemade is actually a product of a dutch company called the real chocolate company using belgian chocolate to create their products those wacky dutch ehthe packaging promises fine quality chocolate made using only the purest natural ingredients a minimum of  cocoa and  honey powder since i enjoyed my stainers honey and ginseng bar so much i thought it would be well worth trying another honey bar albeit a milk chocolate one this timethis bar is divided horizontally into five quite large chunks which at first glance seem rather intimidating in a notsureicanmanageallthatatonce kind of way indeed i shared my first chunk with a  friend so as to avoid any potential cocoa overloadwhether or not theres room for more is anyones guess but if the cakes are as tasty as the chocolate i sampled then they may be in with a good chance the snapper bar appears to come in  a variety of flavours honey not being mentioned and there are love bars dreamers and more promised one to watch for methinkssounds intriguing ill keep an eye outi wonder why theyre australian ive never heard of them
however in germany tchibo coffee shops are quite common and it was there that i came across their selection of chocolate bars of course it would have been silly to buy just the one so in the interests of research i bought all threethe milk chocolate bar comes from venezuela and at  is a very rich creamy milk bar with a fuller chocolate taste than many milk bars it has a great creamy texture on the tongue and is perhaps one of the better milk bars i have sampled recently no doubt due to the high cocoa contentin the case of the middle bar i cant help but think that when faced with the dilemma of what to call it tchibo decided that the addition of coffee and cocoa nibs would serve to differentiate it from the other two this does not detract from the bar itself however this is a great tasting bit of confectionery and the coffeecocoa combination works very well the chocolate is just on the mild side of dark or the bitter side of milk if you prefer and delivers a nice rounded chocolate flavour before you start crunching on the crispy bitsthe dark bar comes from ecuador and is therefore remarkably similar to bars produced by lindt lidl and others a rich bittersweet chocolate hit which melts very quickly and floods the mouth with the dark flavours of  cocoa perhaps they went that  extra just to play oneupmanship with the belgiansas far as i know these are the only three bars currently offered by tchibo and i have to say that like lidl they have managed to come up with some very good products further proof that good quality chocs can be found in some fairly unlikely placesdear chocablogit is so nice to see that alot of great varietal and percentage chocolates are popping up on the market my only concern is that when the big companies jump on the  band wagon to ride the wave of a once artisian crafted prodcts into a mass market circus that it will dilute how special some of these cacao beans were to people searching for a quality experience im sure we little guys will be forced to move on to the next thing for the underground foodies hopefully the big boyz will not see it as a profit opportunity and leave us be lets keep it real
these bags are quite obviously aimed at women the bags themselves are designed to look like handbags  although you might get some slightly odd looks walking down the street carrying itthe bag contains five kinds of chocs x milk chocolate dippersthey tasted fine but werent anything special im sure theyd be lovely dipped in hot chocolate on a cold winters evening  unfortunately i couldnt wait until winter to try them so i just ate them off the stickthe quality of chocolate is fine but im not entirely convinced theres a need for chocolates on long plastic sticksi think id rather have just had a couple of really good quality soft chocolate chip cookies insteadas it was a bit hot for hot drinks when i tried this i decided to go for a cold milkshake version instead of course you have to melt the flakes in some hot milk first then add cool milk and chill the whole thing so the process is a bit convoluted but the result was a deliciously refreshing chocolate milk drink that wasnt too sweeta drink that tasted both of chocolate and of milk  which is more than i can say for any shopbought chocolate milk drinks ive hadthe result is simply delicious  and one of the most moreish bags of chocolate ive ever eaten the carmelised chocolate is slightly softer than normal milk chocolate meaning it melts away in your mouth even quicker and the flavour is delicious i cant quite describe it in words so i guesss youll just have to take my word for it or buy some of your ownthis is certainly an interesting and eclectic collection of chocolates and im sure therell be something here that everyone will love but im also sure therell be at least one thing that everyone doesnt likeas a gift you cant really go wrong with hotel chocolat everything is extremely high quality and the packaging is faultless but if you know the kind of chocolate the recipient prefers  you might do better off spending your money on something else from their extensive rangeas it is i loved parts of this good bag but other parts just left me thinking huh and wondering how they came up with the ideastill at least i have a rather fetching handbag nowthis is all fine dom but will you please review the galaxy ripple pleasepleaseill have a look round and see if i can find one lindtloveras a woman who steadfastly refuses to own or use a handbag preferring the eversodainty backpack or handsfullofkeys look instead this sounds like a handbag id be more than willing to trygalaxyi havent tried that since living in london in  and still miss itin your tasting selection none of the flavours named are actually citrusthanks dom much appreciated
regular chocoholics will all have experienced that painful surge of disappointment when you finally find a highend chocolate bar or block thats been marked down to a more affordable level rush home and excitedly tear open the wrapping only to discover that it has clearly melted and reset a couple of times in transit leaving it with an appetiteaffecting white discolourationhowever as true chocolate fans know if the bar in question is still well within its best before date it is still likely to taste good sure its not something you want to serve on a platter surrounded by strawberries to your friends after dinner but dont throw it out  just wait until youre by yourself and bite it with your eyes shutand so it was with heaven  originally heaven here in australia meant good quality icecreams smothered in thick chocolate like their competitors magnum or news that paul hogan has moved to the us permanently but near frozen chocolate is actually fairly difficult to appreciate  that is unless it is compared with the sothinitsnearlytranslucent chocolatevegetable shortening sump oil equivalent that money saving desserts are quickly dipped inwell damn nestls eyes but their gamble has paid off  heaven chocolate whilst being rather conceited in its brandname really is delicious  note it is milk chocolate but done extremely well  very creamy sweet and finely textured stuff that can be sucked for the few seconds you can stand it before caving in and chewing it to release an even softer and warmer flavouri steadfastly refuse to look on the back of the wrapper to have this almostreligious experience ruined by discovering the fat sugar carb or unfortunate ingredient content just let me remain ignorant and enjoy this fartoosmall bar at a mere g  i hope theyre on sale again soon  ill buy them all white or notupdate from domomg where can i get hold of thesei live in bath ddoes anyone know the competitors for nestle chocolate plz helpthat would be cadbury
as you can see guinness have produced milk chocolate truffles enhanced with the flavour of guinness this statement alone merits a raised eyebrow  after all the question of whether or not the guinness flavour enhances the chocolate is a pretty subjective onethe truffles themselves were  unsurprisingly enough  made up in the classic pint of guinness style milk chocolate cups with a white chocolate head amusing yes but unlikely to have any bearing on the overall flavour i thought to myselfoverall id say that these sweets are much more likely to please the guinness enthusiast not just in terms of their presentation  a nice posh box and individual truffles with their little white heads  but also because they seem to have so much more of that guinness taste that the bar of plain chocolate  seemed to fail to deliverif youre ever in ireland or near a guinness store and looking to treat the stout drinker in your life id say spend the extra money and go for the truffles they are so much better than the chocolateif you get your hands on these please do review them as these japanese chocolates are yummy toohttpwwwmeijicomsghtmlproductsimotherhtmi would be very happy to review any products you would care to send to meplease contact the site if you would like to send any samplesthose look amazing and even better that theres an excuse not to have to share with the kidsloved the guinnness chocolate bars bought them in ireland cant get them in usa can i order some and how muchthank you maryann cataldo
and thats going to be quite a tough challenge given this is little more than a solid slab of chocolate a very large one g at thatthe slab has three varieties of chocolate  milk chocolate a caramel milk chocolate and white chocolate   marbled together to produce a rather pleasing effectthe milk chocolate is smooth and creamy but its the caramel chocolate thats the most interesting part as far as i can tell its simply a blend of milk chocolate and caramel but it tastes delicious its similar to a caramac bar but more chocolatey  and obviously much higher qualitythere isnt really enough white chocolate to get an idea of flavour but its primarily there to make the bar look pretty anyway and it does that job admirablyif theres a problem with the wham bam its simply that theres too much of it ive been nibbling away at it for  days now and i still have over half of it lefti dont quite know who this is aimed at youd have to be a serious chocaholic to manage the whole thing as a gift for a loved one it certainly has the wow factor but im not sure the recipient will thank you for the instant weight gain that almost certainly goes with itawww wow youve given me an idea for my husbands birthday presentare these available in australiariver hotel chocolat have an excellent mail order service and theyll deliver to australia everything comes really well packaged so you shouldnt have any problems buying onlinei had no idea these were so big i guess that justifies the price these areanyway ill be waiting for them to get back to me about my samples before i go about buying from them theyre a little out of my pricing range at the moment thats a beautiful looking slab of chocolateah saucytart wants your job loving this onee waheyyyive just recieved this as a present from my sister absolutely amazing the caramel part is delicious and so velvety packaging great and a fun bar to share ive now ordered the dipping selection box and cannot waiti bought one giant slab last month i didnt expect it woulda be dat big perfecto to bring home as presents for my relatives hopefully it wont get melt odw back but the price omg i get like hundreds of relatives gonna gone bancrupt
so opening the paper wrapper and the foil can anyone tell me why mars went for foil here wrapper reveals a thin bar that most likely will be a bit broken as ive had this bar  times and its been like that everytime sitting there the bar is extremely thin in fact normal mms would have been too big for it so instead you get these tiny mms which of course have a tiny amount of peanut butter in themand thats where the problem lies the flavour is just not there ordinary milk chocolate with a tiny hint of peanut butter now i mentioned earlier that the mms were thrown in and thats no joke there are a load of them in here but the bar is just milk chocolate and these mms are so tiny that they just dont lend enough of their flavour to the bar to give a noticeable peanut butter taste so its extremely plainmy opinion is that a thicker bar with ordinary peanut butter mms would have been a better idea or a bar with a peanut butter filling ala reeses with chocolate mms in it would have been better ideas but what do i know mars have gone for this and its a shame really a bar with unfulfilled promise stick to the normal peanut butter mms as far as this product line goesthe bar has  calories  from fat g protein g carbohydrates g of which sugars and g fat g of which saturatesi dont think mars chocolate is good enough to be in a full bar form i tried a couple of these varieties a few years ago and then didnt see them anymore and felt satisfied that they were discontinuedlooks like theyre back what do you have against soy lecithin is lecithin not used on chocolate in europe as much there are a few american highend brands that dont use lecithin but i dont know of any consumer ones that dontim curious  does your calling them tiny mms mean that there are no mm minis in the ukcybele  we do have soy lecithin but as they said it was improved chocolate then i was hoping not to see it the point was that i couldnt tell what was improved especially when the same old ingredients are at the top of the listrosa  no we dont simple enough answer really 
well this bar has exactly the same format  a g bar divided into  large flat squares of solid chocolate  but it has an altogether more intense flavour to iti think thats mainly down to the nature of the beast this is made with arabica coffee  and while the label lists the coffee content as only  it obviously doesnt take a lot to produce a rich intense coffee flavour because this bar definitely delivers a real coffee hitthat might not sound particularly appealing but its an interesting texture that melts away completely without leaving  any nasty bits behindthe overall effect works really well and if youre a coffee lover you should give this one a try its probably the most genuine coffee experience ive tasted in a bar of chocolate  right down to the caffeine hit at the endadding it to my shopping list as we speakive been checking out the excellence range for a while but now im on the lindt desserts by far my favourites so far are creme brulee already reviewed here and tiramisu irish coffee is also well worth a tryi have bought lindt excellence coffee intense chocolate bars for ages and could usually get it in sainsburys chippenham wiltsmy local supermarket but they have withdrawn it as have whitehall garden centre lacocki had to travel  miles away to malborough waitroses to get supplies i have now found melksham waitroses now stock it which isnt quite so bad but i would like to get it more localmy husband and myself get through about  bars a week and have been buying a months supply at a timewe love the bitter dark chocolate taste with the tangy bits of coffee and let it melt on the tonguebeautifur flavourwe caravan a lot through the summer and always take supplies with uswhen we run out we look in the supermarkets while we are away but never ever see it only the orange intense which we do not like so muchdo you supply coffee intense in bulk by post

turkish delight is made from starch and sugar and has a soft jelly like texture it usually has subtle flavourings  rosewater in this case real turkish delight is generally cut into cubes and dusted with icing sugarthe result is a significantly higher chocolate to turkish ratio in this bar and that in my opinion makes this a whole lot more palatable  for me frys turkish delight is just sickly but this is actually quite nicetoo be honest i prefer more turkish then chocolate i think in this bar the chocolate is too overpowering and you cant really taste the inside fillingbut then i find that with all dairymilk barschuckles doh my god it looks so delicious i wish i can taste it right now  may be evry day
once unwrapped youre greeted by a pleasant chocolatey minty aroma but first impressions are that its not particularly intensethe taste isnt particularly intense either its certainly minty but its no mintier than other chocolate mints out there the chocolate itself is dark but at  cocoa solids it cant really be described as intense eitherbut despite this  or perhaps because of it  this bar is one of the nicest chocolatemint combinations ive tasted the dark chocolate and mint flavours work well together without completely obliterating each otheri think thats partly due to the fact that mint intense is made with natural peppermint oil blended into the chocolate itself rather than a thin layer of cream like most other chocolate mints the result is a proper bar of chocolate thats both refreshing and moreishi have to agree with you about the box bit the one good thing about japanese chocolate is that the stuff is packaged in boxes and a lot of care goes into it just a shame that most of it sucksi will definitely have to check that one out when i can find it  we have most lindt variety blocks here but the mint one tends to hide out most oftena friend of mine was waxing lyrical about this one a week or two ago glad to see it impressed youde too i really find lindt chocolates really tasty the first time i saw it i got attracted to itbecause of its outer appearanc even the chocolate is very rich and purede too i really find lindt chocolates really tasty the first time i saw it i got attracted to itbecause of its outer appearanc even the chocolate is very rich and purei really appreciate that we have a really good chocolates in shopsi love mint  dark chocolate i most love itits delicious in mexico they sell it for  dollar i received one of these for easter and im eating it slowly i completely agree with your review this is very nice and it works better than having a layer of minty goo down the middle like so many others
per  segments chocolate orange tangy has  calories g of protein g of carbs amazingly thats all sugar and g of fat g of which saturatesi just want to add that its nothing more than a coincidence that i reviewed a terrys product in case anyone thought i did it on purposei was wondering ha nice chocablog post i actually discovered the chocolate review through chocabloghmmm flavorless bits that get stuck in your teeth no thanks p hahahaha
classic cappuccino belongs to their dark chocolate range which are all superb trust me i will write about the other flavours in due course  with  cocoa solids the chocolate itself is bittersweet and yet somehow has a creamy mouthfeel to it compared to the sometimes graininess of other dark chocolate varieties the pale coffeeflavoured mousselike filling inside provides the perfect complement to the dark chocolate and if you want to have the full holy trinity of memorable mouth experiences eat it or suck it very slowly with a freshly ground and brewed cup of coffee or piping hot cup of tea for a cheap but worthwhile thrillit is a tad disappointing afterwards to read the ingredients label i must stop doing this for the fat content alone is enough to make me depressed and therefore reach for another block but there doesnt seem to be any actual coffee in the cappuccino filling  oh well whatever theyve managed to create in their secret laboratory using sugar vegetable oil antioxidant cocoa mass milk solids good old emulsifiers and flavours has worked embarrassingly well even for a chocosnob like myselfnestle may have recognised this oversight and tried to make up for their flavour fakery by brazenly sticking the label a rich source of antioxidants with a red tick logo on the top right hand corner of all of their dark chocolate range  after googling how much dark chocolate is good for you and getting a list of  sources it was clear that the dark brown stuff we love has a valuable antioxidant called flavonoids in it that helps reduce blood pressure and heart disease  a couple of clicks later revealed that studies varied on how much chocolate should be given to benefit the patientput it this way im much more inclined to believe the study that gave their human lab rats g per day compared to another study where they only got to eat  gramshave you tried the haighs cappucino bars yumyumyumi tasted the roasted almond one its goooooooodrecently fell in love with club cappucino despite the lack of actual coffee only to have it snatched away nestle have discontinued it due to a drop in sales had just the right mix of bitter sweet and cream suffering withdrawal now as i cant find anything as i like as much
well im glad to say the answer is a resounding yes ritter have managed to create a white chocolate thats both deliciously creamy but not overly sweet like so many other white chocolatesthe format of this bar is exactly the same as the other ritter sport bars ive reviewed a g square of chocolate divided into chunks but if you turn the bar over it quickly becomes apparent that its packed with nuts  they stick out of the underside more than any other bar ive seen its obviously made upside down in a mould with the nuts and chocolate poured in to keep the front side and the ritter logo on each chunk looking nicewhen you first open the bar theres a pleasant vanilla aroma not too strong just enough to tempt you to break off a chunk or threebut the best biggest surprise this bar is just how crispy it is you see in addition to whole hazelnuts it also contains puffed rice and while neither the nuts or rice add a great deal to the flavour they do signinficantly enhance the texture they also help to make this bar a little lighter and more refreshing than a solid bar of white chocolate would bedefinitely recommended and further proof that ritter sport represents the pinnacle of german engineeringit may be a ritter sport bar and it may be very good but its not chocolate  just sayin  other than that i enjoy your reviews here greatlyits funny last weekend at the store i picked this up and put it in my basket after reading the label to see that there was real cocoa butter in it but then decided against it mostly because i have a stack of valrhona bars i should really eat firsti love white chocolate so this looks like a must for my next shopping trip i havent seen this on the coles shelves so where is it available pleaseriver im in the uk but id imagine most places that sell ritter sport would have them if they dont hassle them
now looking at the bottom of the box one cannot help noticing that three squares thats three squares contains  of your rda of saturates thats pretty steep and methinks mainly due to the hefty dose of cocoa butter used in the praline filling so i wouldnt recommend this to anyone attempting a strict dietit smells lovely  a rich mixture of coffee and chocolate that makes you feel like youre sat in a very nice cafe somewhere in europe while the baristas serve up numerous coffees and hot chocolates when you pop a square in your mouth you are immediately aware of the additional cocoa butterit melts on the tongue so quickly spreading its coffee and chocolate loveliness across the palate in seconds and distributing the tiny bits of coffee bean all around your mouth leaving you with a crunchy treat for when the chocolate has slid down your throatits rich its very creamy and its slightly naughty in short its a damned fine piece of work and one which has prompted me to pay much closer attention to supermarket own brand chocolate if youre partial to a proper coffee and you love your chocolate then look no further  this is the best combination of the two flavours i have come across so farthat must be some chocolate to make you think youre in a coffee shop in europe when you are in fact just sitting in your house either that or you have an incredible imagination simon either way ill have to go and pick one of these upi cant get hold of these bars could some more reviews on local chocolate be put up like celebrations or something for examplejust seen your website terryniftyif you live in the uk you are never more than  minute from a tesco these days id say they were fairly locali only live near a morrisons we only have one tesco in bath and its tiny plus its the opposite side to where i livei completely agree the bar is fantastic and although  squares contains  of your daily saturates ive noticed all tescos finest chocolate contains no hvos hydrogenated fats theyre the only ones i steer clear of and im a size  so carry on munching i say also have you tried the tesco finest  swiss chocolate bar its the nicest dark chocolate ive ever tried equally as nice as hotel chocolat but half the price i bloomin love chocolate but not green and blacks yucky did you know they have been bought out and are now owned by cadburysnot so green after all everything has its price as they say ps chocgal my advice is make the trip across town itll be worth it if you walk it you can burn the calories as you eat it on the way home goshjust based on this review i will need to jump the pond to get to the other side of the globe for a bite of this  mmm sounds fabulous
green  blacks bar uses a  bittersweet chocolate placing it in the middle of the cocoa content scale for the three cherrychocolate products i have reviewed unlike the lindt bar the cherries are whole dried and of course organic tart little things comprising  of the overall bulk of the barof course the immediate effect of using whole dried cherries in a bar like this is that it is impossible to snap the chocolate along the guidelines scored into the bar one simply has to allow the cherries to dictate where the bar breaksthe chocolate is as one might expect delightfully bittersweet and acts as a perfect counterpoint to the sharpness of the dried cherries the cherries themselves are remarkably similar in taste to the holland  barrett cherries but the chocolate that surrounds them is definitely a more adult oriented product where the lindt bar offered smoothness due to the cherry content being more jamlike this bar leaves you with a mouthful of delightfully tart little cherry bits to chew over once the chocolate has melted awaywith the chocolate being slightly less cocoaheavy  less in fact than the lindt bar and because it doesnt also have chilli in the equation this bar is remarkably moreish as i sit and write these final sentences i am surprised to see that i have already hoovered up half of the bar no doubt then that this is a winneroh and did i mention that sainsburys are currently offering them at half price see you in the sweetie aislegreen  blacks have just launched in nz and the chocolate is to die for especially the vanilla white flavour that looks like it has real flecks of vanilla beans through it  sooooo good  worth paying that little bit more for to treat yourself
i decided to offer one of my coworkers the guy who had in fact accompanied me to perugia and was therefore well appraised of my errrm interest in chocolate a sample as well so i sat down with him and broke off two shiny wonderful smelling squares which we ate simultaneouslywe sat there chewing and making appreciative noises  mmm yes definitely great chocolate the cherry filling is rather lovely etc until almost in unison we expressed a lack of chilli tang to the product still munching we made our way to our little areas to continue working as i wondered to myself if it were possible that lindt had somehow managed to screw up a productit was as the last bits of chocolate were melting away that i was suddenly aware of a spreading warmth on my tongue  the chilli had arrived almost at the same instant my friend reappeared and said now i get the chilliso somehow those clever soandsos at lindt have managed to produce a bar that releases its flavours over time first you get the luscious dark chocolate then comes the sweetness of the cherry filling and as youre finishing your mouthful the chilli element creeps out onto your palate for a gentle warming finish a marvellous achievement on their part and a great bar to tantalise your friends taste buds withanother point to the swissgreen  blacks do a dark chocolate with dried cherries baryou ought to try sarottis almond chilli chocolate heavenlymhm my mom and me tried that one it is great please could someone tell me where i can buy this chilli and cherry chocolate from as i cant find it and it is very yummy thxi work in one of the lindt chocolates retail stores here in the atlanta area and word is that we are supposed to start selling this bar sometime later this year  we have already had such fantastic comments on the cherry and chili creations bars by our customers and i am ready to see what the chili bar is likedoes anyone know where to find lindt maracuja passionfruit  jalapena chocolate  ive had a friend shipping it from germany and would like to find it more locally  it is way better than the chili cherry  they have a hot collection that i have only been able to find in germany which includes mango  jalapeno papaya  cayenne etc  deliciousteresa our friend from germany too has sent us wonderful lindt chocolates passionfruit and jalapeno pomegranate and chili papaya and chili why arent these for sale in the us lets sign a petition theyre unbelievably goodgreat chocolate this is one of my favorites the plain chocolate mousse one is good and the orange one is really good but this is top notch stuff in my mindi was able to find the chilicherry orange and chocolate mousse in the big lots in my town  i was able to pick up these gems for only  each half the retail price twice the pleasure for price of onethese are amazing chocolates the flavors mingle first the richness of the dark chocolate then the sweet subtle cherry and finally the warmth of the chili its a treat for the sensesthe hot mango with cayenne is awful scrape out the filling to salvage the chocolatethe hot mango and cayenne is awesome does anyone know where you can get it in the us  it is truly a treat for the seasoned chocolate loveri would love to try the other exotic hot fruit dark choc range after relishing in an xmas chili cherry bar for almost a month good value excellent experience where can buy on lineshipped to ukthis is sooo yummyi actually found it at a grocery outlet at cents a bar i wiped em out hahahahaha yummyi just bought a bar of the cherry  chili chocolate gonna try it tonight had to catch a preview thobtw i got my chocolate on sale for about  a bar which is a very good price especially for something sounusuali tasted this chocolate once and i became fun of it but here in hungary the only place i can buy it is a lindt shop where it costs apprx  euros   its f lot for a bar so im really interested in which are the countries where it is cheaper so that i can ask visitors from couchsurfing to bring me some i used google but it didnt help so what country and shops do u recommend thnx in advancewe have recently discovered the lindt cherry and chili  what a fabulous treat  we cant get enough  after reading the comments about the hot maracuja we have to try that one too  great stuffhi to everyone who loves the hot chili chocolate by lindt  i have some for sale on ebay right now so if you want it you better act fast because its selling like mad  if you havent already tried it it really is deliciousthose of you asking if these bars are for sale in the uk i have bought up stocks of mangochilli and grenadinechilli from p stores in london sure they will be hitting the  shops as we speak  ecstasy on a shoesting
migraine medicinei am a loud and proud chocoholic who is also a migraine sufferer  yes yes yes i know that chocolate is a forbidden food that medical experts recommend that migraine sufferers steer clear of but it hasnt made any difference in my case fortunately  i had a few miserable months  on several different occasions  suffering an entirely chocolatefree existence but mr migraine still elected to keep on visiting me on a fartooregular basisthe weird fact about having migraines is that when they have hit you in full force being able to get down a good dose of caffeine actually helps reduce your swollen serotonin levels and quieten down those satanic gnomes playing techno music on your synapses  to put it more bluntly it somehow allows my poor thudding head to unfold from the foetal position and gives me an hour or two to get out of work and straight into bed or to do what i have to do before mr migraine gives me another kinghit to the headpretty bloody great actually  when this marvelous migraine medication is taken with a cup of good italian espresso coffee country total now seven it does its very best to give mr migraine a swift kick in the groin  cocolo has a bitter taste and its strength of flavour complements coffee perfectly  it is not as creamyfeeling as some seventy percenters and has a slightly grainy texture so i wasnt as tempted to inhale the entire bar in one sittingi dont think its a stay in and watch a dvd with a glass of baileys on friday night kind of chocolate because it isnt sweet enough but it sure packs a cocoacaffeine punch that enabled me to stagger out of bed by lunch time instead of bed time the other day  it also beats taking codeine and having to barf up in a bucket every half hour or so i suggest that every major hospital emergency department stocks up on these blocks to save money spent on pethidineheck yeah this is exltcay what i needed
the only difference is that boost has had all the good stuff taken out and from a quick glance at the ingredients replaced with all sorts of artificial rubbish  that doesnt taste particularly nicethe peanuts and crisped rice of the starbar have been replaced by copius quantities of an overlysweet glucosesyrupytruffle substance and bits of biscuit  the result is a heavy  almost stodgy  and sweet bar which is quite hard to eat and doesnt taste of anything muchcadbury use the strapline charged with glucose on boost which in itself is a bit odd roughly translated this means packed full of sugar i can only think theyre positioning it as some kind of energy bar its pretty high in calories   bar so thats possibly the only way they can sell iti dont have anything against boost but when your unique selling point is that youre loaded with sugar its hardly surprising cadbury dont know how to position itomg i love the boooost bar it deff gives me a boost its the most yummiest chocolatiest bar of cadburys p pwhats glucose is it healthyi love it craig glucose is just a kind of sugarthere seems to be a new boost in the uk with is about  the thickness it used to be doubt ill be buying another anytime soonthis is among the chocolate bar gods im talking daimdream territory if your on the munchies look no further booooooostboosts are lovely lol far nicer than the starbar ive never come across any crisped rice in a star bar yet lol boosts have alovely chocolately truffley centre although i do agree with the glucose claim just aswell its been removed on the new look bars lolboosts are my favourite chocolate bar only one thing wrong i have never opened one without it sticking to the wrapper why is it the toffee has always seeped onto the wrapper chadley potato craft staddle pop broptang howseyfirstly could i just say joy that i couldnt agree more with your comments the caramel seepage problem does put a dampener on the otherwise extraordinary experience of inhaling a boost secondly the copius quantities of an overlysweet glucosesyrupytruffle substance is surely a selling point the reviewer clearly needs to manup and learn how to appreciate a good thing when he tastes itonly joking it was a great review  im just overly protective of my favourite choc bar
a few days later a little airmailed parcel arrived  with my hands trembling with anticipation i opened it to discover this gorgeous packageit promised me the world cadbury milk chocolate nougatine i assume that means soft nougat as opposed to the teethshattering variety caramel and crispy cereal pieces sort of like rice bubbles   when it came to opening up the bar my heart sank for what i unpeeled was this carcrash of a confectioners nightmareit may not be in the best focus but please excuse that due to my disappointed sobs making my hands unsteady and tears fogging up the lens  i could only surmise that our littlebigman jonathan coleman had accidentally sat on it during his flight back from his uk radio stint  despite that lingering and rather unsavoury mental image i was still determined to try it  one never looks a gift chocolate in the mouth and jessies judgment has always been reliable when it comes to chocolates amongst other things  besides looks arent everything  as jonathon coleman himself would attestlucky for double decker because what it lacked in looks and presentation it more than made up for in taste  the chocolate is still the distinctly milky sweet cadbury we all know and love and the melted nougatine stuff had a pleasantly chewy texture tasting faintly of coffee and burnt toffee in a nice way  as i write this im hoping that those two flavours are naturally in the bar and not as a result of jonathon colemans rearend adding extra ambiencesurprisingly too the crunchy bits were still crunchy and the thin caramel layer was intact and gorgeously sticky  i could quite easily understand why jessie is inhaling these as part of her motherhood preparations and wont be surprised if her first born is called something like dudley dexter or dorothy debra out of respect  this is the kind of chocolate id take along to watch the adelaide crows football team on a rainy sunday afternoon  or maybe four  one for each quarter of play
a couple of things swiftly became apparent one  no percentage of cocoa given on the packet and two   guinness beer content granted the bar also contains floral hops mixed spice and hop extract but perhaps guinness beer might be another example of the world famous blarneyanyway a first sniff at the bar and yes it smells chocolatey probably a good thing after all do we want chocolate that smells like a pub in the morning the initial taste is if anything a little smokey on the palate with the more floral hop tastes coming in as the chocolate melts there is a certain beery aftertaste to this bar but id be hard pressed to confirm it as being guinness and believe me i know what guinness tastes likei daresay that like myself most of the people who buy this bar will do so for the novelty value or as an interesting alternative to the irish cream truffles and other local confectionery on offer there are also truffles available a box of which were given to me for my birthday so expect a review soon the chocolate itself is fairly unremarkable save for the hoppy beery flavour worth a try and probably likely to be better received than a pair of guinness socks or a toucan tiepinhowwhere can i buy this in isausaguinness socks dare i dream what better gift than a couple  of these bars in a pair of pint slippersdid it say what the guinness content of the guinness socks was if its more than  theyre probably just permanently damp and stickywhen i was touring through ireland i stumbled upon this wonderful chocolate  it truly is decadant  i bought a case of it  it lasted over a month and then it was gone    i have been searching high and low for the chocolate again but have not been able to get it again  does anyone have any suggestionsi bought a ton of these when i was in ireland last summer they are so good i wish i would have bought more they also had an irish coffee not guinness bar that was out of this worldi really need to find this chocolate my mum brought me back the dark chocolate caramel bar and it is heavenly words cant describe it is the most perfect caramel and soft guiness dark chocolate someone put me out of my misery and tell me where i can buy it i thought these were pure genius  the hops and toasted barley malt of guinness are a perfect compliment for dark chocolate  i was impressed  i wish i could find these in the states as they would make a perfect gift for my guiness drinking friendsguinness sorry for spelling error just noticed as i reread posti was just wondering if there are any shops or retailers in kildare that sells guinness chocolate
luckily this is a particularly nice ice cream so it shouldnt be too much of a choreive always liked magnum anyway if youve not seen it before the formula is very simple a good quality ice cream lolly coated in chocolate theres been many variations on the theme over the years usually they just change the flavour ice cream or the chocolate coating but the basic formula always stays the samethis is one of the simpler variations but its one of my favourites simply because the chocolate is so nice at  its certainly not the darkest chocolate weve ever reviewed but you probably wouldnt want it much darker in an ice cream after all youre going to have to eat this all in one gothe chocolate both smells and tastes divine this is definitely proper chocolate its rich and smooth and breaks with a satisfying crunch when you bite into itthe bittersweet flavour is perfectly complemented by the soft subtle vanilla ice cream although its not the best ice cream ive ever tasted its the chocolate thats the star of the show here and the ice cream works perfectly with itif the ever sun comes out again this year ill certainly buy this again  but with the current state of the british weather i wont be holding my breathwhere can i buy magnum equedor
my first thoughts were that there was something very unchocolatey about the pinky purple colour of the coating but a quick read of the packet informed me that it was indeed chocolate albeit coloured and therefore more than likely originally white still the thought of dried cherries interacting with chocolate was enough to persuade me to shell out  or so for the baga word of warning about these little fellers  they are seriously moreish it doesnt take too long before you look down and see that youve decimated the bag  especially if youve been foolish enough to offer them around ive not come across dried chocolate coated cherries before no doubt another reflection of our conservative tastes in confectionery and as someone who likes both cherries and chocolate its a fine discoverythese would make a great snack food addition to a picnic party treat or tv watching nibbles  maybe even a good way of sneaking some fruit into your kids dietstry themvery interesting review more holland and barett stuff please do not share with childreni love chocolate in fact i have posters of chocolate bars on my wall next to my picture of mr cadbury he is a legend
the chocolate used in this bar is definitely of a very high quality smooth glossy and inclined to melt very quickly when held it smells dark bittersweet and with a hint of ginger once in the mouth it becomes apparent that newtree have used flakes of either unsweetened or very lightly sweetened ginger which sit in perfect balance with the richness of the chocolate  for me this is the perfect gingerchocolate combination albeit a rather pricey one the ginger flakes are just that  tiny little shavings which are released as the chocolate melt adding their warmth to the taste but never detracting from the flavours of the rather lovely belgian chocolatei wouldnt hesitate to recommend this to anyone who like me has been looking for a great ginger chocolate if you look back at the ginger chocolate faceoff review i posted you will see that what i had hoped to find was a bar with the dark chocolate of the waitrose bar and the unsugared ginger of green  blacks well folks here it is spruced up with guarana given a daft name i mean sexy chocolate and available in supermarkets rather than from an exclusive chocolatier or mail order this is lovely stuff just dont overdo it if youre caffeine sensitiveone of my favouritesalmost unbeatable
here in the uk one of the weirder side effect of the expansion of the eu and the strong pound is that we get a lot of imported products in the shops  even when there are britishmade versions availablewhen you bite into your properly chilled bounty the chocolate should break with a satisfying crack and coconut will be deliciously cool and refreshingso pretty much the same as the milk chocolate version rightwell yes and nothe dark chocolate makes a really noticeable difference with this bar the chocolate in the milk chocolate bounty is slightly bland and a little sweet with the dark version although it may not be proper dark chocolate the cocoa content isnt listed its just a little tastier and a little less sweetits a subtle difference but enough to make it even more refreshing and satisfying on a warm day like today personally i never buy a milk chocolate bounty if the dark version is there toodefinitely recommended just make sure you chill it firstit sounds similar to the almond joy you can find in america im not sure if there are any in the uk though
this bar is made with puffed rice rice crispies in chocolate and a thin layer of toffee all coated in milk chocolate its simple light  grams   calories and surprisingly tastythe rice is crispy the toffee is chewy and the chocolate is nice and thick the whole thing has a very pleasant cocoa flavourand thats pretty much all there is to toffee crisp but i really quite enjoyed it which i think just goes to show sometimes the simple ideas are the bestits simple and satisfying but not very big this makes a nice midmorningafternoon snack but its not going to fill you up well not unless youre like me and eat five at onceyour dead right these bars are ace they remind me of when i used to make rice crispies cakes at easter when i was kid p do you think you could review and thorntons choco bars as they are simply gorgggeeous dthere was a time when there was a plain chocolate version in a blue wrapper once id tasted that i lost all interest in the milk chocolate ones bring it backive just got back from my local odeon cinemaand they have toffee crisp popcorn on sale  absolutely delicious g boxtry chilling before eating give a really nice change of texture to the crispy bitsplease please please bring back the plain chocolate toffee crispthese certainly arent gourmet or posh but they are a favourite of mine as i have had them growing up and i love the toffee crisp popcorn from the odeon it is sweet and absolutely deliciousi want the plain one backthank you people look at me as if im making it up when i reminisce about the plain chocolate toffee crisp in a blue wrappernow i know there are other people who remember them too
i came across these around the same time i found the j d gross bars a couple of months ago and have been munching my way through them ever since there are a variety of flavours including cinnamon available but i have only tried the pure chocolate version so faras you can see from the picture on the packet these are whole roasted almonds enrobed as the posh choc makers like to say in milk chocolate and dusted with cocoa powder and they are quite simply deliciouspop one in your mouth and you get the immediate hit of the dark cocoa powder followed almost immediately by the milk chocolate starting to melt and adding its sweetness to the mix bite down carefully and you can split the chocolate away from the nut and let it all melt away before you sink your teeth into a wonderfully crisp almonda word of warning  if you go to lidl to buy these dont make the mistake i did and buy just one bag theyre far too moreish  youll just end up monstering the first bag without realising it and then pining for more id also beware of sharing them too it just makes them disappear twice as fastseriously recommended and not too pricey eitherthese are indeed very good and one bag is never enough however if you should manage to get your hands on some weihnachtsmandeln from lindt you should really try those they are very similar but just ever so subtly better i believe they are with cinnamon not sure whether they are offered here in germany you only get them around christmas timebasini in romanian means farts lolnormal ca de la ploiesti alt raspuns nu putea sa vina  bravocouture parties  the florist sluhod have made her a new one that is a poor excuse   if it were me i would have taken a few flowers from the centerpieces and created a new bouquet or ran to the nearest grocery store and bought new flowers or take the bridesmaids
every time i think of fruit  nut this is what comes to mindthat was over  years ago and i still know all the wordshaving said that i do still like an occasional fruit  nutthe fruit part of the bar is raisins there doesnt seem to be as many raisins as there are nuts but at least you can taste them they have a nice fruity tang and add a distinct chewyness to the barim the kind of person who will happily munch on a bag of mixed nuts  dried fruit so the addition of chocolate makes this a nice snack for me other people may find it a little dullhmmm im uk born an bred and as far as i know its hazlenut and rasin over here and almond and rasin in the uscan you clarifyps reading your archives loving it hi my name is shauni i would like to say that dairy milk chocalate is the best chocalate you could ever have thank you for listining shauni ps you should bring some new ones out like hazelnut and fruithope you tack it in consideration pleaseits yummyi wanted to know cadbury dairy milk  fruit  nut  made in australia  imported ingredients  is it pure veg suitable for vegeterian  which others r suitable for vegeteriani love dairy milk fruit and nut its my favorite amongst all of the other dairy milk cadburies  i love it a lot thank  u dairy milkthe fruit and nut content has significantly declined since the hershey takeover the raisins often have the stalks on them and the almonds are now verging on the soggy they used to be crisper
i have no idea who thought it would be a good idea to use so much maracuja yes thats passion fruit to you english speakers but im afraid this bar scores a chocoablog first for mepeople may i present to you the bar i could not finishneed i say morepeople may i present to you the bar i could not finisha bar you could not finish  blasphemyhey sorry is there anyway anyone could review some more local barsor maybe the scrummmy ones you get from thortons  im addicted to them p o
this is my third review of a lindt product and once again its remarkably different from the previous bars i have tasted creme brulee and caramelthis bar is made from cocoa grown in the tropical forests of baracoa cuba  not somewhere youd automatically associate with chocolate productiona glance at the back of the packet tells me that this is one of three regional bars the other two being from madagascar and ecuador and that it is the mildest of the three at  cocoa but what intrigued me about this bar was the promise of a very pleasant note of tropical fruits i double checked the ingredients and there is no additional flavouring so whats the tropical fruits bit about i wonderedhaving had a rather unpleasant experience with a feodora passion fruit bar i was somewhat wary of being assailed by a perfumy sickly sweet aroma and taste but being the fearless dedicated type i proceeded anywaythe smell test was very promising  no nastiness but a distinct sweetsharp tang above the usual cocoa aroma very interesting indeedthe taste is unlike anything i have tried before  you get the initial hit of dark cocoa but it is almost immediately joined by a very definite citrus note hard to define as being like a certain type of fruit but most certainly there i can only describe it as being rather like that mixed tropical juice you can buy but very subtle and certainly not at odds with the cocoa taste the chocolate itself is as smooth as you or i would expect not too dark tasting and ever so slightly bittersweeti would definitely recommend this bar its unique flavour puts it on the must try list for any serious chochead and i can see it going well with coffee and cake or being used to coat fruit once again the chocolatiers at lindt have come through with another top notch productwhere can we find a package of this bar sounds great ive actually eaten chocolate from cuba but had to go there to do that now i run a news service about cuba on the internet though chocolate isnt the reason for the news serviceactually my dad and his parents used to live therelindt makes great chocolate anywaythanks for the notewalter lippmanncocao beans have distinct flavours of their own like grape varieties  that is where the fruit notes come from  the beans themselves which is the whole reason behind single origin chocolate ditto for coffee bean toothat unusual taste is cigars honestly theyre a slight tobacco cigar tobacco undertone to this stuff the soils that give cuban tobacco its flavour also every so slighly alter the taste of the cacoa beans that make this stuffit was sold in canada for about  years  or so then vanished to be replaced by stuff from peru or something pity it was my favoirite of the threeim guessing it had something to do with wanting to sell this line in the us where anything from cuba is bannedi bought some on ebay from canada in about  it was marked best before june   it was mailed however from a us border city and when i wanted to get more the store was off the internet  i have been to baracoa cuba and it is indeed the best chocolate i know
im not entirely sure what spanish oreos were doing on the shelves on my local budgens but as so often happens they jumped into my basket shouting pick me pick me and begged to be eaten how could i say noi must confess i have mixed feelings about oreos i spent a year of my childhood living in the us and just the word oreo brings back happy memories but every time ive had them here in the uk ive found them to be a bit dry and quite dull im not sure if thats down to european differences or if ive just grown out of themas i carefully cut one in half for this photo first impressions were pretty good the chocolate coating is thick and had a pleasant aroma and the whole thing looked quite tempting with a nice contrast between the different layersand it tastes pretty good too i do find the biscuit a little too hard for my taste and on its own it is slightly dry but the creamy filling and chocolate coating easily compensate for this the chocolate is very nice and definitely improves the overall oreo experience for mei still cant say im a huge fan of biscuitscookies but i did quite enjoy these they were especially good dunked in my teayes i know im a slob a chocaslobill have to get some when i go to the grocery store nextof course we do have double stuf oreostwice the filling dunked in milkyum why are you a slob for dunking your biscuits into your tea i think this is one of the weird british pet hates  ive never heard anything like this in germany or the netherlands and i dont think the french would hold this against you either but then they are foreign like me what would i knownormal oreos seem dry to you because you arent having them with a big glass of cold milk sillyive seen these locally connor keeps grovelling for me to buy them i havent brought myself to actually try one yet chocolate overdose ive never seen them anywhere but here either odd isnt itbiscuits are made for teahmm looks yummy here in malaysia we have more ores variety  i dunno about u allwe have oreo wafer sticks oreo double stuf orea original duh and a few more oreo types as far as i knowby the way while eating chocolate why not play this flash game i made link is there with instructions httpsaudihayashideviantartcomartmaplestorygamepapulatusenjoy both the chocs and gameone local shop greenock scotland keeps traditional oreo blackwhite biscuits and a cafe in a nearby town sells these and also a white chocolate covered version great  the cafes owner told me today that the latter were being discontinued  is this true anyone  aaaaghthose are the original choc covered oreos  seems spain has left them in their deliciously original state  large bathed and scrumpcious  i dont know what the heck us kraft was thinking when they changed the formula over here  the rippling effect the misleading pure milk chocolate labeling and the smaller cookie does not fool this oreo lover i was so disappointed when i saw  the box which is smaller and different marketing colors  the cookies themselves ares maller  only  in a box  to a row compared to the original   in a row  and they just do not tates as good  in the original choc covered version you could literally take a small bite and have a nice piece of chocolate by itself it was so thick  booo kraft  you blew it on this one  it will be my last choc covered oreo i will buy of your new versionwe found both the milk and white choc covered oreo baadas while on holiday in tenerife the milk choc ones are very nice but the white choc ones are out of this world there must be somewhere in the uk you can get themedit ive found one place in the uk that says they can supply them httpwwwpartridgescoukindexphpfuseactionshopcategorycategoryidits not all good news though the milk choc ones are  a pack not that cheap but they dont do the white choc ones they do however do the double stuf ones but theyre  a packhave been searching the net for white chocolate covered oreos but to no availhave had them brought back from amsterdam by friends so possible trip coming up to bring quite a few packets back i think regular oreos are easy to get but the scrummy ones are harder to come by anybody find them please advisestraight awayu ned to make beter fod u laszy bumsi am struggling to find the white choc covered ones too they really are out of this world i saw them in spain years ago and recentlyt in tenerife cant believe i cant buy them on the net please let me know if you find themfound them onlinehttpwwwamericansweetsdeadvancedsearchresultphposcsidffbefeabcddkeywordsoreo
and then you bite into it and youre immediately hit by something so sweet it feels like youre being force fed  bags of sugar it once it really is that sweet there is definitely a vanilla taste in there but its almost completely overwhelmed by the sweetness its a kind of sweetness that hangs around in your mouth for an hour after youve eaten itthe texture is smooth and creamy and pleasant enough but for me the sweetness is overwhelming thats not to say its inedible but i dont think i could manage more than one or two chunks of this bar a day but if you have a really sweet tooth or youre simply in need of a massive sugar hit this might well do it for youive never tried a dream bar but i know i do love milkybar chunkyfor the kid in us all eh dsounds like this is something id likeas the saying goesyou tried the rest and now tried the best its hmmmmhmmmthe bestyou would never want to stop eatingcadbury dream is a satisfying chocolate bar but having too much makes it become sickly i think that if this bar was a bit less sweet it would taste even better maybe different varieties rather than just the normal bar would be good too
cadbury picnic is another of those bars thats been around forever but i rarely buy i cant put my finger on exactly why  it just doesnt appeal to me muchpicnic is from the chuck everything in a bucket and cover it in chocolate school of chocolate making its very rough and ready and as you can see quite nobbly lookingi dont think ive ever grown out of picnic bars i agree its not the most sophisticated bar on the market but i guess i like the random composition of it and you feel like its quite a substantial snack due to the different fairly chunky ingredientsthese are much tastier than a lion bar one of my favesi do not think this is the same picnic bar that we get in western australia where it comes in red and yellow plastic and does not contain raisins it does contain wafer caramel peanuts all smothered in milk chocolate if only they made them with dark chocolate swoonthe picnic is vastly superior to the lion bar which is far too sweetvery dull      wow could not disagree more picnic is one of my favorites i would rate it sligthly higer than snickers which i also lovethis is a brilliant bar and i still like them even now
unlike most of the products we buy today this bar has very little to say about quantities and nutritional valuesit contains chocolate cocoa mass cocoa butter gmfree soy lecithin and natural vanilla the packaging is also a little unusual being a sort of silvered bag which expands when cut openanyway down to the crucial part  what does chocolate taste like when its mixed with coriander im assuming that coriander leaf was used in the process as the wrapper suggests the presence of greenery but i could be wrongon opening the packet and having that first big sniff i was delighted to get a nose full of dark cocoa aromas the chocolate itself is dark and as soon as it hits your tongue you get a lovely subtle hit of cocoa flavours followed almost immediately by a sweeter floral note which must be the corianderthere are tiny particles of something crunchy in the bar as it melts so i must assume that coriander seed is used and that these tiny bits are in fact the result of the seeds being milled for blending the chocolate is quite bittersweet and incredibly moreish the combination of flavours is really something else the sweet floral notes of the coriander blending wonderfully with the darker cocoa tastes to produce a quite unique taste i love this chocolatehaving tasted this bar i will certainly be keeping an eye out for both de bondt products and any other bars i can find with coriander in them highly recommended even if it is a ridiculous price to pay for g of chocolate
yes theyre selling daim as we now refer to them being good europeans balls or bits as theyre not really spherical at all in the food shop so for the sake of a little nostalgia and to see if i still liked them i bought a bag well two because i might have really liked them  and ikea is a fair old way from chez michalakso was my curiosity rewarded there are two very obvious methods to consuming these little fellers one throw a handful in and chew them up two slowly suck all the chocolate from each piece leaving a collection of little toffee pebbles in your mouth then chew them up producing the lumps in the teeth effect described earlier i prefer the bits concept to the daim bar primarily because i dont think i could cope with the amount of sugar in a daim bar all in one go having the option to eat a few pieces and then reseal the bag is far more to my liking good enough if you want to feel like a kid againoh and theyre great for decorating a cake with toodo you think sometime anyone could review the poppets range mmm the rasins and orange ones are mint surely the minty ones are mintsimon hes a very confused young man why he was probably on a cocktail of drugs as he typed throw an aero at his head and tell him to go back to sleeplol no i live in bristol and we usually use the word mint to describe something as good  thats all haha pi love the raisin poppets mmm p
chocolina is an austrian company offering chocolates made from sheep and goat milk the goats milk products seemingly branded chocolisathe crucial point is of course does the stuff actually taste any goodso what does it taste like i hear you crywell its actually rather sweet total carbs   of which  is sugar with a very smooth consistency the fact that its made with sheeps milk gives it a slightly more yoghurty flavour than a dairy chocolate and the hemp seed adds a nutty element different but not so different that it would deter me from trying more of their productsthe website hints at darker bars but this was the only sheeps milk bar i was able to findas a milk chocolate bar it is quite palatable but i would be interested to see how sheeps milk would pair up with a higher cocoa content as for goats milk chocolate well id be intrigued to see how they manage to get it to taste chocolateymy heart nearly jumped out of my mouth when i saw the title of this i was sure youd just reviewed the same bar i have and am ready to review in the next week or two turns out mine is very similar but instead of being the hemp seed bar i have the grape and poppyseed barnow where are my blood pressure pillswhen i was growing up in ontario before we moved to bc my father always bought us chocolate goats milk bars i cannot remember who made it and it appears they have not for a while but in comparison to every other chocolate bar out thereit was truly my favourite i begged for one each time i was in the stores it is sad not to find them anymorethe milk we get from our nigerian dwarf goats is fresh sweet  has very high butterfat   it is awesome for making soft cheeses and for baking into quiche pudding waffles and anything asking for milk  offtasting goat milk is usually caused by the way it is handled  all equipment must be sterile and milk needs to be chilled immediately   pasteurizing homogenizing  other treatments will change the taste  quality of the milk  i would love to try making chocolate bars what a cool idea
until a couple of years ago it was known as dime here in the uk im not entirely sure why  if theres one thing that annoys me its when the same products get different names in different countries for no apparent reason i guess they figured we were just too stupid to be able to pronounce daim until the bar itself is simply a thin flat layer of hard crunchy caramel covered in milk chocolatethe taste is very distinctive it has a slightly burnt smokey flavour if youve ever made caramel yourself and left it cooking a little too long youll know the sugar quickly starts to burn daim tastes like the caramel is sugar has just started to burn but just enough to give it a bit of flavourthe chocolate itself is a fairly standard milk chocolate its nice enough but nothing special it tends to melt away quite quickly anyway leaving you with a mouth full of the crunchy caramel you then have to decide if youre just going to slowly suck on the caramel or risk breaking your teeth by biting into it think of it as a kind of dental russian roulette only swedish with chocolatepersonally i love daim bars but they are very sweet im not sure id want a bigger bar than this and even with a g bar i find myself breaking small chunks off and making it last all dayif youve never had a daim id recommend trying one i think they may be an acquired taste but for an occasional treat or a quick sugar hit you cant beat itmmmh yummy normally i go for different chocolates darker but daim always was nice despite the sweetness  at least when you only have one every two years or so i think i have to get one soon again eww i hate daimi remember them as dime bars all hard and sticky in your teethalmost as bad a caramacsdaim is good but even better is daim ice cream cone there are daim balls in the ice cream and a delicious coat of chocolate but i dont know if you can buy it from the uk because its made by valio which is a finnish brand although its nowadays owned by nestloh sorry i have to correct that its not a product of valio but gb glace which is a part of unilever groupit looks just like a skor bar hershey  heh  id be willing to try one if i could find it over herei used to buy the tiny bars of daim  ikea uk but they now started producing their own ie  mini rectangular very sweet milk choc with mini bits of crunchy caramel no where near dame bites so if someone there knows  where to get them please let me know  i simply love them you can find them at ikea in the usthey have them in ikea in the uk as well woolworths and most supermarkets near me stock them in the midlandsthat candy was really gooddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd so can i get some for freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee you know what i talkin bouti love dime i want some now    wher will i get somewhere can i find it in kuwaitmy name mr nadeenrose in kuwait salmiya mobailphoneits very gooooooooood its yummy and very  easy to find its goooooooodlol there only p i can buy lots and lots of them sweetdiam bars are lush like my friends meat ball head lol hahahacan i know daim halallawful or not i really to know about thatthey are p in the ukverity  that means theyve gone up p in the  years since this review not really surprising i guessthere is in uae alot of these and the jaw breakers yum and the apple candys yummyer and theres alotthough i have only once been in an ikea store this chocolate bar almost sounds similar to the skor chocolate bar thats here in canadaive just bought a dime bar for p  p initially sounded expensive but the sandwich van guy had a good sales pitch so i bought it despite the high pricemind you that amazon affiliate link above sells daim bars for  usd including shipping  now thats an expensive price for g of sugar and caramelactually dom the daim bar are often chewed at least in sweden we dont mind chewing em at all its just great as least i read about dental health sweden had no problems in that area either p so chewing daim is perfectly safe and fine do it like us swedes chew it pa complete addict of daim bars has anyone an idea where to locate an easter egg made of this yummy chocolateby the way i think the reason we used to call them dime bars over here was it is actually a word and daim is pronounced dame in uk  a dame bardime bars make me smile but they make my smile crooked best bar of the year every year since the s i would rate them as probably better than most types of cured fish if only because i prefer sweets to more raw varieties of food the other day i had a bath and ate a dime bar afterwards which is highly recommended due to the consistency of the chocolate coating and the smoothness of enamel i have encountered a lot of resistance to dime bars i think they are probably a bit of a political hot potatowhere can i find daim in canada thankslove themtry ikea  i know they have the little ones wrapped up like candy but they still taste the same i didnt see a big one but i like little ones anywaymmmmmm  milka daim even better i think  not quite as sweet as original daim as mix of chocolate and caramel more evenly matched  lindt choc with crunchy caramel pieces gorg as wellskor from hershey is indeed the us version of daimi love daim found some today in iceland in north london after years i had my last one when they were still called dime multi pack of three cost  bargain i find it funny how everyones like i cant find any  and im like haha i have one like nearly everyday pmy friend tiernen orourke loves milka  daim bars he thinks they are the perfect combonation i tend to prefer crunchies they are very niceits just great  
i remember my first marabou purchase being one of those tubes of milk chocolate discs which always looked as though they were going to last forever but somehow never managed to stay in my pocket for more than half an hour or soyes i was in ikea returning an unsuitable light fitting and i happened to notice that their shop was selling their own branded chocolate yes its in a flat pack thank you dom naturally i saw an opportunity for another one of my faceoffs would the cheaper newcomer manage to outdo the established brand indeed is it possible that the two bars are made of the same stuff we all know that some companies make one product for a number of labels after all a glance at the ingredients shows that both bars contain the same amount of cocoa  and roughly the same ingredients so it looked like a good match was in the offingmy purchase was fairly welltimed as it goes i had the pleasure of a birthday sleepover and consequently four of my sons friends joined us for an evening of playstation pizza and piggery the perfect chance to do some serious testing eight of us sat down together to taste the two bars side by side one group of four trying the marabou bar first while the others were offered the somewhat smaller squares of ikea chocolate naturally once the first square had been eaten we changed ends  for the second tasteand the verdictunanimous  the ikea chocolate had about as much taste as one of their cardboard boxes the chocolate is plasticky lacking in either cocoa or milk flavours and leaves an unpleasant aftertaste the marabou bar on the other hand was creamy smooth and well it tasted like chocolate no contestso while ikea may have sold the uk most of its bedroom and kitchen furniture apparently something like  in  british children are conceived in ikea beds so i read they definitely have a great deal to learn about making decent quality confectionery this is one to avoid folks awful low quality tasteless nastiness it might be less than half the price of the marabou bar but youd be hard pressed to eat a whole onethat review is extremely bias youve listed very few decent taste specific reviews about your verdict and there is little reason to believe you know how to sample food in a way worthy of such conducthumerously enough the ikea brand chocolate you have reviewed here is becoming quite the sensation on most of the prime tastetesting and food blog websites and has rated over milka and ferraro in texture qualityid be either inclined to think your an ikea hater or simply bought a stale blocki completey disagree i havent tried the expensive chocolate but i have tried the cheap one and it was so nice it tasted just like galaxy to me so yours must have been off or something its norwegian chocolateno it is german made chocolate in ikeas chocolate not norwegian or scandinaviani was also delighted about the ikea chocolate brandi dont know where you got your chocolate all of the ikea chocolate ive eaten has been quite good preferable to other mainstream chocolates found everywherei bought the dark chocolate and the one with hazelnut golly i was surprised they both were very good they cost only  cents each cheap  yummy however i do miss marabou although it is quite expensivemy only hesitancy in raving about the ikea dark chocolate which i bought a huge supply of last week and am quickly working my way through is that if too many people buy it ikea may up the price but anyway i love it delicious and dark chocolate is better for us than any other chocolate apparentlyfunny you should say that i just ate a whole bar and it did certainly not taste like cardboardmmmm ate my way through a marabou like  minutes ago nicest chocolate ever but had a  sample of the ikea stuff and it tasted good i think it will be my next buyi havent tasted the ikea yet but i will try it although i cant imagine liking anthing better than the marabou although i dont know where to get it here in the us if anybody knows please post as i wont be returning to sweden for at least a year and my supply is now all gone the ikea dark chocolate is actually made in germany anyway i absolutely love them im probably in part persuaded by the price tag but im of the opinion that theyre superior in taste to some other more expensive dark chocolate varieties think cadburythe ikea branded chocolate bar which is made in germany does not compare to the marabou swedish chocolate bar that ikea used to sell the german bar tastes like it was made by hershey it has too much sugar and very little chocolate it tastes like it was made of sugardipped wax infused with stale cocoa dusti agree tottally with this comment me and a couple of friends drove  miles late at night to the nearest ikea to purchase some marabou chocolate and when we got there we found they only had cheap chocolate so naturally we assumed the chocolate was going to be nice and purchased like  bars each got home and have only eaten one or two bars in a week marabou is no competition for it maybe it should be compared with cheap easter chocolate or christmas calendar chocolatei am gutted ikea are now only selling their branded ikea food in stores no wonder i could not get hold of any mazarins for months i took the plunge and bought their own milk chocolate disappointed to see it was made in germany whilst it is not a patch on the swedish make marabou it is okay for the price although personally i think it would be better to use for cooking rather than eating as a treat ie i would rather go without marabou is the cadbury of sweden and as in the uk they make all kinds of chocolate bars including plop yes dont ask although my favourite is the kex the kit kat wanna be and japp like a mars bar bar i use to be thankfully to get my hands on swedish goodies at ikea but now i feel they will lose out a lot by not importing there famous swedish brands perhaps now is the time to open that swedish food shop i want to open in manchesterpretty sad that ikea is thinking more about cost than customer satisfaction they might fool nonscandinavians with their generic brands but its nothing like maraboui grew up eating marabou as my mother was born and raised in sweden and we occasionally visited there or had guests visit us from there marabou candies were always an important part of these visits only when ikea brought this candy to the us were we able to get so much of it now that had been taken away i do not understand why marabou does not market their product more possibly they are happy with the business they have by selling only around scandinavia unless they show an interest in exporting these candy bars i have little faith in being able to eat one any time soon my vote goes out to marabou as the best chocolate i have ever eaten i have little use for most of the competition so i rarely consume chocolate  which i suppose is fineikea opened a much awaited store in qatar recently so i was finally able to get my hands on a few of their acclaimed goodies and a part of my weekend haul was two of their dark chocolate bars a  bar that quite resembles the milk chocolate in this review  and  a somewhat more classier looking  bar both were pretty decent and very well priced the  one though slightly grainy still tasted pretty good will surely buy them again and maybe even try a milk chocolate next timeim surprised you dont like the ikea chocolate  although its not top of the line stuff but it still is very creamy and has a great taste  the hazelnut if particularily good with enough nuts throughout the bar for nut in each bite  i enjoyed it if anyone reading this wants to try the ikea chocolate dont let this post stop you
im still not convinced by the whole dairy milk superbrand idea i think it limits what cadbury can do when introducing new products i know they still have several non dairy milk brands but they seem to be intent on bringing as many products as possible under the banneranyway back to the matter in hand dairy milk double choc follows exactly the same format as dairy milk with creme egg or dairy milk with caramel that is its a simple bar of dairy milk divided into chunks each with a soft gooey centreas you can see it looks quite tempting but the problem is that the soft centre tastes too similar to the chocolate shell i was hoping for a double chocolate hit from this but all i really got was something with the taste and texture of a very soft piece of dairy milkcadbury really should have gone with a dark chocolate filling for this or maybe even a thicker chewy centre something to differentiate it more from the chocolate its still quite nice but it could have been so so much betterwould i buy this again probably but i cant see it being a regular purchase give me a dairy milk with creme egg over this any dayi want one nowdidnt the colour put you off it certainly put me off the two choc colours just didnt go well at all i didnt like the filling at all  you are right they should have chose a different centrei was very disappointed  i wanted a more intense chocolate taste got something more bland  the filling is less tasty than dairy milk itself  with half the bar only chocolate flavoured shouldnt it be be called halfchocyour right i was in a service station coming down from london and took the oppurtunity to try one of these  its awfuli think you are all wrong this choc is gorgeous very tasty and fillingjust what i want in a choccy bar well donei love dairy milk i just go crazy for itevery day after dinnerlunch i eat dairy milk and i even like the ads of dairymilk it enhans my mouth wateringi just love it
my experience of ginseng is that in tea form it bears more than a passing resemblance to niffy feet certainly not something id consider blending with good quality chocolatethis bar boasts  cocoa content no word on the amount of ginseng or honey involved making it a borderline dark chocolate in my book perhaps we need to agree a cocoacontent scale to facilitate definition as you can see once again it is beautifully packaged with a cryptic number  above the titlecontents headingunlike many posh chocs stainer chocolate seems to avoid any carving stamping or branding of the bar itself offering the consumer a simple sellophane wrapping and squares of chocolate with a slightly cambered top surfacethe smell of this bar is delightful there is an immediate hit of honey followed by that luscious cocoa aroma one finds in the best quality bars when eaten the honey flavour gets first go at your tastebuds flooding your mouth with its subtle sweetness closely followed by the chocolate melting into the mix the ginseng sits as a kind of subtext to the two main flavours  very subtle but still definitely there and the chocolate is as smooth and creamy as you would expect it to beits an idiosynchratic blending of disparate flavours excuse me i seem to have a dictionary in my throat that works incredibly well and makes me wish id sampled stainer chocolate before leaving perugia had i done so i would almost certainly have bought more of their products just to see if they can consistently produce such wonderfully different flavour combinationsif anyone from stainer happens to read this i would be more than happy to work my way through your entire range and it will be a sad day when i eat the last square of the last bar i may have to open a stainer franchiseplease im begging you do some everyday off the shelf chocolates i can never find any of these slightly upper class ones in my village shopmy apologies its our resident posh chocs experthellowe read your comment and we are so pleased to hear that you enjoy our chocolates we are more than happy to assist you in any commercial adventure you like to begin franchise or distributto whom it may concernwe will appreciate to help you finding the right place where to buy our goodies
terrys d is quite simple and consists of biscuit and a creamy white filling all coated in milk chocolateim not entirely sure where the name comes from but i imagine its partly from the shape of the bar and partly because of the  constituent parts biscuilt chocolate fillingthe bar is quite thick and looks  well made it almost looks like a gold ingot divded into  pieces each with the number  embossed on the topterryskraft are obviously on a roll with these new products but strangely i cant find an official web site anywhere so ive no idea what else is out there but if there are any more ill be sure to review them i like what ive tasted so farhmmm i wonder what the filling is  not white chocolategreat definitely need to find the alternatives to the mars productsmillymoo its not white chocolate its just like a generic biscuit filling soft with a slight vanilla tastewell actually the bit has been originally made in greece from a greek chocolate maker that expanded in central and eastern europe but was then bought by krafti am sad to say that from the moment the manufacturing moved out of greece and ever since it is a kraft company product the quality and taste of the bar has gone down dramaticallyi have been eating english chocolate bars and confectionary for the last  years and the original greek bit was so much better in flavour and realness of ingredients than anything sold here in englandnow bit and terrys d taste like tasteless artificial junkbut they are both kraftmondelez rightyes there is now a single product i think with different packaging to serve a wider market but in the process the product has changed reduced in qualitycould you think of a suitable replacement chocolate bar for both bit and terrys dno reallywhat about twix isnt that any close to the dbitwhat have terrys been making two dimensional bars all this time
just like the others the packagaing talks about how wonderfully good it is for you and the format is exactly the same a large bag with lots of individually wrapped g squaresthis stuff has such a weird taste i can hardly describe it the texture is fine but the taste is something like a combination of rusty metal and rubber there is a slight hint of chocolate in there somewhere but the rubber taste eventually ovewhelmes it personally i found it so unpleasant that i had to go and rinse my mouth outnow this stuff was sent to us by hersheys from the us so im aware that it could somehow have gone bad in transit but given they arrived well packaged in under a week and the other products in the range were unaffected i dont think thas the problem i think this is just an attempt to make a healthy product gone horribly horribly wrongto be honest i found the whole goodness range more than a little disappointing the other products were overly sweet and in my opinion this one is just about inediblecome on hersheys  why not just produce a good quality chocolate use natural ingredients and cut back on the sugar until then im sorry to have to report that i certainly wont be buying any hersheys goodness stuff and ill be making a point of steering clear of this one in particularif youre anything like me the first thing youll notice is that you have instinctively spat it out onto the flooryou liked it that much huh ill be giving that entire line a miss i thinkgod damn hershey is the only chocolate i have ever spat out i really dont know how they can even put the word chocolate on the label its a gross misrepresentation nay abomination of cocoa confectioneryi think youre all nuts i tried both the whole bean and the antioxidant and loved them i didnt get any rubber tire or rusted metal taste at all many people i work with have also tried it and i have not heard anything bad from them about it i suggest that everyone should try it for themselvesi have eaten several of these candy bars and found the taste very nice  i cant tell the difference between this and the regular candy bars so i dont know who that person is that had to spat it out
i must admit to never having heard of chocolate pasta before and so i found myself looking for suitable recipes on the internet there was one printed on the packet but italian is not my strongest languagecooking the pasta was simple eight minutes in boiling water but do you add olive oil given a  cocoa content i thought it best not toid found a couple of recipes on line and had plumped for a raspberry coulis and cream combo since raspberries are in season at the moment and are easy to get hold of so while the pasta bubbled away in the water i set to work blending and warming the raspberries i decided against oversweetening the coulis leaving the natural tartness of the raspberries to be softened by the addition of whipped creamthe next question was  does one eat this stuff hot or cold i had to leave it to cool a little before spooning on the cream and grating the chocolate but should it be eaten straight away or left in the fridge for a while only one thing for it  do bothas you can see i went all cheffy and served it up in martini glasses two of which went into the fridge to cool while we sampled the warm stuff it was a little strange eating pasta for dessert and the low chocolate content of the pasta meant that my tart raspberry coulis was the prevailing flavour softened off by the cream somewhat but still definitely top dog on the palate the pasta had what could best be described as a very subtle flavour and i immediately thought that i should have added sugar to the coulis and been a little more sparing with itit seemed to work better cold by the way the pasta wasnt free running as it has stuck together somewhat during the cooling process but it made it easier to eat with a spoonid be interested to try this again sometime as i thought my attempt wasnt all that successful but i would recommend having a go at this as an unusual dessert offering to dinner guests no doubt chocolate pasta is available in the uk somewhere i have yet to find a supplier online  can anyone help so perhaps next time ill follow a more traditional recipe like the one on the packetthis looks so very interesting i am sure the pasta would work well in savory dishes toohihi many many years ago there used to be a pasta restaurant on dean street london w that had chocolate pasta served hot with vanilla or chocolate icecream as a dessert  it was gorgeous  the restaurant has long gone and everytime i asked for chocolate pasta in delis up and down the country i have met with some very nasty comments i am so glad that it has had a revival and i shall be keeping an eye out to buy some online  as i said it used to be served hot with ice cream nothing else it was lovelyhi my partner bought me chocolate penne for my birthday from the hotel chocolat chain they have an online shop as well and they also sell a variety of sauces to accompany itid picked up some chocolate pasta at pikes market in seattle and  plan on making this for dessert this saturday for friends theyre close friends so if it tastes terrible i know theyll forgive me plan is to top the warm pasta with small ice cream balls strawberry coulis and finally top with shredded white chocolate aka parmesan if nothing else itll be a neat presentationsounds fantastic lili  let us know how it turns outim liking the presentation ideas there lili you must send photos and remember how it looks is at least half of the battle
the packaging claims g of fibre per serving and  less sugar than the leading milk chocolate thats a fact i find a little surprising considering this stuff is really sweetand i quoteingredients milk chocolate milk sugar cocoa butter chocolate cocoa lactose milk milk fat soy lecithin pgpr emulsifier vanillin artificial flavor inulin calcium carbonate sucraloseaside from that this isnt too bad its quite creamy looks and smells like chocolate and its quite edible but its not what id classify as delicious and im not sure id buy it just for the health benefitsall in all not bad but just a bit too sweet for me and im not convinced the artificial sweeteners and flavourings are necessary give me a good quality organic dark chocolate over this any dayhersheys also sent these to me obviously not reading my policy against artificial sweeteners so i gave them to my friends who were curious to try a less sugar chocolate they all said that it was too sweet and had a detestable metallic aftertastecybele i didnt find this one too bad in terms of aftertaste they natural flavanol antioxidant one on the other hand i found almost inedible review coming sooni read that there are lots of fab recipes on this website  where can i find them we dont have lots yet but the dalek cake is quite popular 
these bars are branded extra bitter and the smell of them certainly hints at a dark rich taste the chocolate is almost black and the first taste is definitely bitter on the tongue but as the chocolate began to melt my mouth was flooded with a mixture of bittersweet cocoa flavours the underlying taste is most definitely dark rich and with a very pleasing bittersweet finish with less of the sugariness that you sometimes find in other brands and it has none of the fattiness that you sometimes find in cheaper brands possibly due to the use of different types of fatsoverall i would rate this as an excellent dark chocolate for everyday consumption its very easy on the palate with a distinctive flavour and at around p per bar its certainly easy on the wallet it will be interesting to see if rausch decide to sell their chocolate at similar prices if and when thy launch in the uk because chocolate of this quality could certainly be sold at a slightly higher pricevery interesting ive never seen this particular brand of bar before maybe you would be interested in learning more about trinidads cocoa if so check out the following article cocoas sweet feet httpwwwtrinigourmetcomindexphpcocoassweetfeetarticletake care i just was given some of this chocolate by one of my french inlaws a tasting box of all the different types in the type of sizes the french usually offer with coffee and was looking for more information on it and found your blog  i agree with you on the ecuador i was surprised by how good it was  and the amazonas a  is excellent with that silky meltinyourmouth quality  i thought the trinidad was a bit too pasty  i agree with you its really hard to pull off  although there are chocolatiers that can manage itthanks for the blog  i always enjoy reading about chocolate hi may i know which supermarket i could get trinidad stick bar in uk i was given a pack of it from a netfriend who live in cardiff and i lost his contact last weekim a foreigner who stay temporary in uk and now desperately to buy some more to pamper myself and bring back to my home country i hope someone could give me a hint before i travel back home thankslidl is the only place i know of that sells this wonderful stuffi had some of this to fortify me through a recent bout of decorating it certainly went down very well although it wasnt my favourite of this range id definitely recommend sampling a few different bars from this manufacturer and at only about  gbp per bar that shouldnt break the banki really love this chocolate i get it regularly in nearby lidl store for about  eur i can agree that  chocolate is somehow bitter and not so easy to enjoy even if it comes from lindt the rolls royce of chocolate industryi have been buying this chocolate for a good while now and absolutely love it it is as good as any other brand i have tried but comes at a fraction of the price imagine my horror and disappointment when my local lidl store stopped selling it apparently it has been replace by individual chocolates with a fruit filled centre there were round  packs of trinidasd chocolate left on the shelf and i bought every one i have  packs left and i am rationing them until i find another source i also aim to complain to my local lidl store about them discontinuing this fantastic producti recently jan  ce found a discounter in the usa who had boxes and boxes of the amacado and the el cuador for about usd per box of three dozen gram sticks i bought every single one he had spent about usd but where are you ever going to find a deal like this again it must have cost that much just to ship it here from germany let alone manufacture the stuff ill keep it in the basement cool and dry and allow myself a half stick per day for um a very long timewe have just had a lidl open nearby and when i looked at the packaging on the chocolate i strongly suspected that it was made by fassbender  rausch as the packaging was virtually identical i had read about how good this chocolate was and i cant wait to load up tomorrow up until now we have relied on bringing lots of this great chocolate back from their berlin store when we go on short visits i have loved trying the different percentage chocolates as has my  year oldit really is great chocolatewhere can i buy this chocolates im living in brazili dont think you

im delighted to report that it tastes like chocolate with only one exception dark chocolate kisses every single piece of hersheys chocolate ive tasted has made me screw up my face in horror for some reason i always get an awful aftertaste almost as though the bar had been stored in the wrong conditions or near something powerful tasting or just for too longmy polish grandmother would hoard sweets in her wardrobe for months on end eventually presenting us with out of date treats with a distinct whiff of camphor it was always terrible having to drop them in the bin after testing a in the vain hope shed somehow managed to avoid turning chocolate to poo of course my hersheys eating experiences have always been somewhat similaroh hersheys hmmm well ill give it a go oh no yuck and so onthis time i can report that i have no such problem with these little squares of dark chocolate they taste perfectly chocolatelike my problem is that they contain an inordinately large amount of sugar perusing the list of ingredients and serving size information i was shocked to discover that a serving g is over  sugar  everything else is there  good quality chocolate vanilla organic lecithin  but poor old hersheys seem unaware of adult palatesim sure there are chocolatiers working in the us who continue the european traditions and add their own twists and styles and id love to hear from you but i get the impression that hersheys may well be starting this journey that they have yet to grasp the differences between continents instead of the dark rich bittersweet tastes of european dark chocolate we seem to have an overly sweetened youthful product which may well be aimed at the majority of american palatesid love to see this product on offer with a significant sugar reduction keeping the same ingredients and adding nothing more if anyone from hersheys should happen to read this id say a for effort but you definitely need to drop some of the sweetness this product might well get some of the milk chocolate eaters over to the dark side but i doubt that anyone with a confirmed love of dark chocolate would make this a regular purchaseyou forgot to mention finland never tasted fazeri have indeed tasted fazer and i apologise to any european chocolate manufacturers i may have omittedit has been some time since i tried fazer and i will make a point of getting hold of some as soon as i canthank you for your review of this hershy bar  ive seen in the shops and have been tempted to purchase and try it out but now i think i will pass it byive always been disappointed by the taste of hersheys and i have tried other hershy dark bars hoping for something palatable and have been disappointed  youve saved me some money  green  blacks chocolate caramel is the best chocolate in the world it cannot be beaten plus its fairtrade which makes it ultimately the best chocolate in the worldon the coasts of the us theres a lot more variety in the chocolate available i live in the san francisco bay area and theres a definite preference for locally made or imported chocolates that taste more of chocolate and much less of sugar lots of chocolate cafes and such opening lately too on top of our very excellent local chocolate producers whom i maintain can stand their own against european makers its true that hersheys recently bought local favorite scharffen berger but they seem to be keeping their hands off what are hershey kisses supposed to taste like anyway they even smell funny did you ever get your hands on any scharffen berger if not drop me a line and maybe i can send you some later in the fall when the weather cools down
ask any british child of the s to name their favourite childhood chocolate bars and you can pretty much guarantee curly wurly will be right up there back in the day there was nothing cooler than to be seen walking down the street munching on a giant bar of cadbury goodnessbut what is curly wurly well its very very simple its a long flat lattice of caramel covered in milk chocolate kind of a squashed double helix in fact if god had experimented with making dna out of chocolate and caramel then accidentally sat on it wed probably have ended up with curly wurly a few hundred million years earlierthe caramel is thick  almost toffee like  and very very chewy it gets softer as it warms in your mouth but youre pretty much guaranteed itll get stuck in your teeth which is part of what makes it so goodbut what really makes curly wurly special is the shape theres nothing else quite like it even in its modern shrunken form its only  grams its just about the longest chocolate bar youll find in the shopscurly wurly is delicious incredibly chewy and more importantly its iconic theres nothing else quite like it its just a shame its not quite as big as it used to bemmm havent had one of those for a while havent seen them anywhere actuallyif you want to buy these in bulk they have a great price of  bars in a box for only  at foodirelandcom  i hope mine arrive this afternooni am the curly wurly master i live one mile from the bournville factory on a nice summer day with the wind in the right direction i can smell the choccy cooking even worse was schooling dame elizabeth cadbury school is a quarter of a mile from the factory and then i had to go through the birdcage walk right through the plant on my way homecurly wurlys if god existed he would have been making them on the seventh daywow i havent had seen or thought about these for decades what fond memories of chocalaty goodness it brings
made by feodora this bar has  cocoa bitter dark chocolate blended with lime oil obviously were all familiar with orange and chocolate but ive never seen other citrus fruits included in chocolate bars nor have i ever seen feodora chocolate before so it was something i was very much looking forward to tryingas you can see from the photo it fulfills the posh choc criteria by being divided into large thin squares with the manufacturers logo stamped into the chocolate as soon as you get close to this bar you catch a whiff of lime something i have always liked i remember monstering my way through many a quarter pound of chocolate limes as a boythis was by no means the most expensive bar i bought while away and im surprised that theres nothing like it available from uk manufacturers are our chocolate companies so loathe to try new flavours that we are condemned to dark milk or white from the big companies all i can say is thank goodness for the new breed of english chocolatiers whose rising popularity must surely be related to the dearth of any decent product from the big boys

also during university i remember knocking on my best mates door and opening it to catch her redhanded leaning over her milo tin with a heaped spoonful half way up to her mouth  im happy to stake my left butt cheek on the statement that every aussie would have resorted to eating it straight from the tin during times of sheer boredom or when there was no chocolate in the housethe overall effect is firstly a pleasantly chewy maltychocolate sensation followed by a few delightful rice crispy crunches and a tingle of caramel before the chocolate coating seals the deal  at g the inner pig that has been carefully nurtured inside of me always squeals for another but if i can find the g kingsized version then were both reasonably happy  if there was a way of coating the bar in something unmeltable then they would be ideal carborich food for hikers and bushwalkers or indeed desk jockeysthese are definitely one of my favourite every day snack chocolate bars to buy and are one of our quiet achievers in that they are rarely advertised but are available in every deli and roadhouse in the country as reliable sellers  theres an entire row dedicated to them in our uni caf so the students must be constantly fortifying themselves with the lovely logs in an effort to enhance their study breaks to avoid them entirelyif you see one buy it  and eat it with a glass of fresh ice cold milk for the perfect flavour combination  in fact buy twoargh i hate you i was about to review this tomorrowah man what am i supposed to do nowactually after reading this tomorrow im still gonna review it because im not from australia had never heard of this brand before and will hence have a different look on itbut stillwhat bad lucksorry terry  still you should try it  i just hope its using the aussie version of milo otherwise youll end up with a mouthful of brown dustdefinitely review it terry  and feel free to post a link in the comments here its always good to have multiple opinionshttpthechocolatereviewwordpresscomnestlemilothere you go not nearly as long because i didnt feel the need to go into incredibly long indepth background info on the bar i just took it as it wasmy friends and i had a debate over this bar  did they change the recipe a little while after it was originally released i remember the milo filling bit being a lot more like the wonka fudge bars that were out a few years ago and a lot less like the good ol crunchy miloxxive said it before on cybercandy and ill say it again the new bar sucks  its awful compared to the old bar the new bar is just mushy chocolate crackles with a bit of milky bar thrown in the old bar consisted of super dense compacted milo goodnessi am going to try and make a bar like the original milo bar any suggestionsmaybe try adding a tiny tiny bit of egg white to help bind it together only a suggestion thoughcan you tell me or anyone how much energy the bar has saturated fat total carbohdrate and sugars becasue i need it for school work wich is due next weekplease tell me or else i will die this is my last question can you tell me where you would find these information that would help me thanks for trying to helpanyone else think it is similiar to a  grandthe original was the best i wanna lobby nestle to change it back i never buy the new ones coz i hate it its basically chokito how wants to join mei want the original milo bar back i loved that it tasted like milo and nothing else not this extra crap theyre packing in with it now you can hardly taste the milo at all boooooothanks for naming your best candy bar after my family name milobar  i will definitely be buying some for my family  our name originated in croatia yugoslavia for your information  i am told that there is an area there full of milobar familiesi am so disappointed yous have stop doing milo bars they are so yummyand i look forward to having them if i you yous where going to stop  making them and selling them i would have brought heaps and freeze them so i had them please bring them back soso yummy
but this is a bit different its actually nice very nicecaramel bite is two thick bars of milk chocolate chocolate biscuit caramel and puffed rice it has just the right combination of crunchiness chewiness and crispiness and it tastes pretty good tooim not normally a fan of biscuits in chocolate bars as they often end up a bit dry but the biscuit in caramel bite is just right  quite light in texture and chocolate flavoured  and more to the point theres not too much of itthe puffed rice is barely noticeable but it does add something when you bite into caramel bite you get the crispness first followed by the crunch of the biscuit then the chewiness someone has clearly put some thought into the experience of actually biting into this and that makes a refreshing change from the lets stick all our spare ingredients in a big bowl and see what happens attitude that you often get from large chocolate makers these daysat  grams this is quite a big bar but after finishing it i just found myself wanting another so if youll excuse me im just off down the shop to buy anotheryuuuum  all we get of terrys here in australia is their vastly overpriced orangesthis is one of the most insightful and entertaining confectionery reviews ive ever read  seriously this is brilliantit iis almost as injoyable reading about it as it is eating iit ii just ate one and it was like heaven who ever thought of these you deserve a medal there delicious mmmmmas they say never judge a book by its cover one of the best tasting bers on the market
described as being shot through with peanuts and caramel and on the other side of the wrapper milk chocolate with caramel and peanut centre i reckon this is missing out the best bit its a small amount of best bit but still a best bit is a best bit  and for me its the crispy ricehow odd  i was just about to write my own review of starbar  i think you did a far better job of it than i would have thoughi cant believe these things have been around so long yet i dont recall ever having had one and what exactly is the gooey centre it looks and tastes to me like they just got all the ingredients and stuck them in a big masherthese things are very good but you should be ashamed for being able to eat so manyyum  i wish we had those as ordinary bars in australia although they look like chokitosthere basically like a boost but with peanut butter flavour and peanuts instead of truffle and biscuit i believe i have had one of those on a trip to ny i loved itwow  great review  i want to go out right now and buy some  thanks for the postwow  proper old skool choccy i remember when these came out and im not sure if they ever changed the wrapper i do remember the gooey filling though excellent findthese candy bars were the best funny thing nobody knew about the my all time favoritethaks for a wonderful daylove dougie poostar bars are the besti used to eat these all the time when i was younger and somehow im still less than  stone now at the age of  but then i think they stopped making them so i switched to peanut boost attempted replacement by cadburyswhen i mentioned them to some work mates about  years ago they thought i was imagining things and strangely enough i found some in my local shop  days later so i bought about  to prove i wasntwell done eating all of those chocstressi think they have changed the wrappers simon i seem to remember they used to be plain orange not the orangeyellow sunburst that they are nowhi you are quite right and no one seems to believe me alsoa was given my nickname nunchat the age o  yrs old am  now and people still call me nunch to this daya was given that name from a cadbury nunch bar blue wrappernunch written in block capitals in yellow writingmickboyle is  correct starbar is indeed a reincarnation of cadburys nunch a s popular choclate bar  remember the add where a dark haired woman walked through a forest with a horse behind her anyway nunch changed name a few times and eventually became starbar tastes very similar to the original nunch bar enjoyi loved these things and now im exiled to america havent had one in years my british husband claims not to know them at all so thanks for the proof now all i need is a few cases of them would you like ne to post you  some  over  the  pond    xxi knew iti was right all alongnunch was not a figment of my imagination thanks for confirming my sanitywhat did star bars used to be calledup the nunchomg  i am from los angeles and discovered the starbar on a semester abroad in london in   i immediately became an addict and every time i pass through england for any reason i stock up on these to bring home  there is nothing like iti have lived in england all my life have seen these on the shelves and yet had never tried one then my other half bought my one saying you like these dont you it looked like the sort of thing you like and i can tell you something i didnt like it i loved it if i didnt have solid steel willpower idve gone right out and bought another essentially a boost minus biscuits add peanuts my new favourite chocolate barif youre into star bars then there is now a dedicated site to this brilliant bar of chocolate youll find a potted history in the making wrapper images including the very rare image of the original wrapper there are also a couple of videos tooi find the star bar a cross between a moro and a snikers its quite tastyhaha  bars fatty fatty boom boom wow srsly though chocoholic muchluking testy i dont think these can easily by purchased in asia  but whatever boost is available in australia and is very nice shaped baryummy  these bars are scrumptadoodiddlyicious   best savoured with a nice cup of strong milky tea and a relaxing tv programme ahhh bliss lifes small pleasures tried my first on the basis of this review last night agree its a good hit of peanuts and although i fancy a more liquid caramel inner core and wafer shell maybe it ultimately sorely disappointed they forgot a vital ingredient a hefty pinch of saltno more salt please we can always add our own if we want to a chocolate bar errrmmhow
stainer is an italian marque a company run by andrea stainer in tuscany my eye was drawn to the stainer selections because of their beautiful packaging pictures of faces flowers scenes that evoke the origins of the bars very posh as dom might say the prices fall close to the posh mark as well stainer makes quality products using fine ingredients and the price reflects this having said that the stainer bars were by no means the most expensive on offerwhen the time came to taste i offered the bar around my coworkers many of whom were either unwilling or downright repulsed by the flavour combination on offer the bar contains  cocoa solids still more than many socalled milk chocolate bars available in the uk and was infused with coriander turmeric chilli cumin fenugreek caraway ginger and black pepper a zingy little number thenthe chocolate didnt have the fireyness i had expected the ground spices warmed the tongue individual notes appearing as the surrounding chocolate melted producing a very pleasant combination which really does taste very madras the chocolate itself is definitely part of the overall taste but doesnt really come into its own until ones mouth is clear of spices as a medium for carrying the spice tastes it does work rather well although as a confirmed   head i still found the end taste a little milder than i would have likedid be more than happy to review more stainer products should you wish to send somelook for rertail source for  stainer maya spezie del messico chocolatehi jonbestthat sounds delicious theres no taste i like more than milky curry actually so ill definitely have to seek this outmany thanks to all of whom are interested in our porducts stainer is a little company situated in italy and we are very proud to hear about your discussions and alikness
simon michalak reviews something a little out of the ordinary for chocablog  a hotelearly in april i found myself starting a two week stint of work in italy and purely by chance we were booked into this hotel for our first nights staywhat a lovely coincidence i thought business and pleasure and businessso what does the hotel say about itselfthe first hotel in the world dedicated to chocolate  comfortable rooms set on three floors unusually named after the milk the gianduja and the dark chocolate the hotel houses a delightful restaurant where an entirely cocoabased menu may also be enjoyed besides a wellstocked chocostore where products of the best chocolate manufactures may be sampled and purchasedjust to the left of a small bar there is a little display area including thisthe caption reads something like would you like to realise a dream a bathtub full of chocolatethe reception area is very pleasing to the eye and the walls are dotted with display cabinets offering various chocolate related crockery mainly large cups and saucers but also cocoa containers and platesthere are also a number of displays offering chocolate trowels of various flavours which tend to give one the impression youre in something like a cross between willy wonkas factory and a garden centrethe staff are friendly speak good english and greet you with your room key and a bar of chocolate related to the floor youre on i was handed a bar of milk chocolate and directed to my floorthe room i was given was a double just as well as i dont fit into a single bed my first proper italian hotel and my first impression was how much like a greek room it was high ceilings white walls plenty of space and some nice touches such as the desk glass top over a collection of cups and the muralof course as soon as i had settled into my room i was off downstairs for a drink and a good old look around the hotel chocostorethe store itself sells all manner of choccierelated goodies including tshirts a pair of chocolatey handprints strategically placed on the chesty area anyone towels hats fleeces lanyards ideal for keeping ones tour bus key on and of course chocolatechocolate of many hues shapes varieties and from all over the worldas well as bars they offer unusual shaped novelties as well  keys padlocks tools i have never seen a chocolate spanner before but alas no chocolate teapots an ideal gift for anyone who has let you down if you ask methe hotel bar is also well stocked with chocolate liqueurs which i decided against trying but i counted a good dozen bottles with the magic c word on the labelsoverall id say that the hotel definitely belies its  star rating the unusual theme good sized comfortable rooms and the friendliness of the staff push it higher if youre planning a piggy pilgrimage to the home of baci the italian ferroro rocher id recommend the chocohotel as a good starting point an unusual theme well executed well stocked and very friendly nice workim all for chocolate baths but that one doesnt look particularly comfortablewhat fun and a great writeup  ive never heard of such a place im not too keen on the bath whether lumpy or not thoughas i pointed out in the review the web site is somewhat out of date witness the  calendar we were offered just the one menu and it was somewhat bereft of chocolate
it breaks my heart to include a word like mediocre when writing about chocolate but mms deserve a rap on their australiansubsidiary knuckleslast year sometime mms australia went to considerable trouble and expense to fly over pamela anderson to launch the new green mms  what pammy actually means to australians who like mms andor the colour green escapes me but pammy herself might have considered that the shape of the little orbs are not unlike miniaturised versions of her own implantscrispy and mint have never really gone that well together and im yet to find any other australian chocolate product that flavours a crispy biscuitlike filling with mint  normally youd expect a creamy fondant ala frys chocolates that dom reviewed earlier we aussies can only buy them from specialty chocolate stores for roughly the amount of a fortnightly mortgage repaymenton presentation the little green goobers didnt look too bad  glossy appealing but still not quite answering my question about why our proud nation needed a cartoon character like pamela anderson to launch them  why didnt they approach bob brown leader of the aussie green party or tim flannery renowned environmental scientist and writer and throw something like  cents from every pack goes to the australian wildlife as a procommunity sweetener instead of funding pammys own personal wildlifesadly this serious issue was immediately forgotten when i tasted them  dusty vaguely minty dry biscuit centres do not work  the chocolate as per all classic mms is great but the crunchy bird turd in the centre is worthy only of spitting out at clueless fortysomething porn starlets who now badly need to investigate polar necked sweaters and toning down their trannyenvy makeupuntil we gain victory i remain a sad seeker of peanut butter mms from specialty choccie shops who see me coming and increase the price of these nuggets to well the price of gold nuggetsim with you on this one  forking out  for peanut butter mms from david jones is ludicrous i also have a grudge against the evil henchmen from the mmpire for ditching the white chocolate varietyif thats what you call mediocre meaning of average quality down there id love to know what you call badi was in sydney last week and found peanut butter mms in the convenience store across the street from my hoteland i love the crispy mint ones  ive never had the original crispy mms but i think ill give them a try now  i love things like nestles crunch and buncha cruch  are those types of things not found there often  crispy chocolate with rice isnt unusual here in the usfound this on a random search to find out what the heck crispy mint mms are after a friend went to hk disneyland and tried some  we dont have crispy mint mms here in the us but the regular crispy ones are dry and kind of grosswe do however have the peanut butter mms and i agree they are fantastic  my absolute favorite  now they have a limited edition shrek pb mm that are  bigger than the regular according to package  can i also tell you that subbing a big bag of pb mms in place of choc chips will make the best cookies youve ever eatenlet me know if you ever want a batch sent over as a strangers act of kindness  i cant guarantee how well theyll ship but i can find them on sale at the local store for  for  most timeslolits really unfair of you to tell people to write to the mm company to tell people to get them to stop producing mint crisp mms just because they wont make peanut butter mms here in australia for you doesnt mean you have to encourage the demise of a product that many other people enjoy thats just mean you dont have to like it but many other people do   ok i have to ask does ausi land not have the childhood myth that green mms make you horny  why else would they have pammy there probably in something skimpy for the unvail of green mint mms personally they remind me of girl scouts thin mint cookies another highly addictive itemwhen i tried theseit tasted like eating toothpaste all i could taste was overpowering mint and no chocolate never againthe crispy mint mms are the best i always had ten bags at home any given timei loved them and im australian i guess you dont get it but its a rice crisp centre with mint like crunch not a biscuit centre i wish theyd bring them back its thanks to you we dont get nice things d
these days with all the wonderful dark chocolate on the market my tastes have changed whether bourneville has changed too i dont know but it just doesnt appeal to me in the way it used toi think the wrapper for this bar says it all cadbury call it plain chocolate rather than dark and the back is mostly taken up by a recipe  as well as an advert for stork margarine i dont know anyone who has bought stork since the s it appears cadbury see this more as a cooking chocolate than an eating chocolateive probably just grown out of bournville if you think of it as a kind of beginners dark chocolate then it works but if youre expecting a high quality bittersweet experience then this isnt iti bought some bourneville hot chocolate for the family and nobody liked it so i put it into my favourite chocolate cake recipe and it won the record for being the worst chocolate cake on the planet what happened it used to be nicecadbury everyone buys stork margerine  i bought some todayto be honest i hate chocolate but when it comes to white chocolate it is a different storyvery nice site thats it it tastes exactly like drinking chocolate powder not that i resort to eating this not in company anywaysi love bournville like anything  it gives me a pleasurebut i hardly find it in indiai live in mumbaiplease have them available hereor at my addresslet me know if you can via email i ll forward my addressyummyyyyyyyyyyyyyplease be sure that bournville again become available in the local stores of kolkata it will be more cool if with an added bitterness and less sweetnessi bought two bars of bourneville chocolate today and it is the best chocolate on earth the taste is perfect whereas cadburys milk chocolate is imperfecti have personally discovered that asda own smart price product is superior in every way cocoa solids min  and so it tastes great excellent for cooking too at the time of writing it was pgrm bournville is pgrmand no i dont have any connection with asda as pretty much the only thing i buy from them is this chocolatei can get you some lovely chocsnice ad plz can give me link to down loadi find green  blacks dark chocolate the  cocoa product gives the ultimate bitter taste i am a huge fan of dark chocolate and as you stated started off with bournville and immediatley catagorized this as dark now i have ventured into other brands bournville just doesnt appeal to me anymore i find either green  blacks  or lindt dark is very nicei love bourneville dark chocolate especially with a cup of coffee it is wonderful melted with strawberries and you can use a little cream with it if you like bourneville is wonderful as an ingrediant for baking good chocolate cakes my heart sinks when i think of cadburys being sold to an outsider like kraft so i now wont buy it ian slade i wouldnt know how nice lindts dark chocolate is since they didnt start producing it until after i called a boycott on their products over their financial support of a charity thats well known for its eugenicist researchjer maybe i need to make this nik at nites cake week my wedding cake was the best cake ever until i saw yours that was true awonemesess erin how to top that cake i suggest a lifesized desmond cake and then invite me  joshua send awayi was looking for cocoa content for bournville and came across this site my husband and i love bournville we eat four squares every day for dessert with our coffee we were given dark chocolate easter eggs and they are  cocoa and totally inedible we tried but they are so bitter give us bournville every timeso velvety smooth a real tongue cuddle and such a treatugh my wife bought me a small bar of this as a treat but oh how it has changed from what i remember as shiney bittertangy fine chocolate  i looked at the wrapper small black text on dark red hard to read but yes only  cocoa solids now  i note that your headline says  and i guess they are lowering it by degrees so that it tastes more like american candy  sorry but they have ruined what used to be a lovely taste ill stick to premium dark chocolate if i need a fix bye bourneville amul dark chocolate is better than bournville it is cheaper and has  dark chocolate with lesser sugar
i do however and thought it was high time to eat another in the name of explaining to those out there who have yet to do soa few of my friends find them extremely sickly because the inside caramel filling is gluggy and granular rather than flowing or chewy and has a strong taste of condensed milk about itthat may not sound attractive but it works  it must be something to do with the surrounding layer of rice crispies which is then coated in a thick sweet layer of milk chocolate  i recommend that this be tried with a cup of coffee hot tea or glass of iced cold milk to counteract or complement as is my view the tastebud tingling sugar rush  in fact so sweet are they that its one of the few bars i wouldnt be able to manage eating two of thats a sentence i never expected to writetheres a dark side to the chokito though and by that i dont mean the type of chocolate they are often used as joke props in acting circles  aussie champions of the chokito are also very quick to assert that the poo in the pool scene in the late s movie caddyshack starring bill murray and rodney dangerfield is a shameless copy of a much older aussie traditionrocky an actor friend who has appeared in various aussie movies advertisements and on stage tells me that its a tradition to float a chokito if there is a scene involving water  there i was trying to wash out the stains of murder on my hands as macbeth  out out damned spot  when lo and behold i find a naked chokito fetchingly resting at the bottom of the basin  it took all of my concentration to refrain from turning around and saying aw dennis i know it was you you mongrel and instead get on with the sceneperhaps thats why i never catch anybody eating onechokito is also made by nestle in brazil its my favourite chocolate bar i now live in canada but always ask my family to bring me some when they come visitwho is the man that stars in the current chokito tv commercial my husband and i recently discovered that we both favoured the chokito in our nz childhoods so we went searching online for them  the box arrived and we sat down with a flat white and half a chokito each  sadly it wasnt the heavenly bar we so fondly remembered  something has changed  is the chocolate coating thicker and now drowns out the crunch of the rice crispiesi just googled chokito to try and find out where it comes from originally since its produced by nestl only in switzerland australia and brazil i stumbled onto this cool post of yours and realized that i had just eaten two chokito bars in a row with no coffee or milkonly ever tried the australian nestle chokito but i thought it was great love the crunchy rice piecesany australians in the ukdoes anyone rember the chokito ad with the hush group chokito really gets you going how can i get a copyi remember the original chokitos with delicious fondness and although the new chokito is made using a new formula i love it they are so yummy i can scoff down  in one sitting i tell a lie i can eat chokitos were my  pregnancy craving loved these bars then and love them now
if youve never had one kinder surprise is a thin milk chocolate egg with a little yellow plastic capsule inside stuffed inside the capsule is the surprise  a random toy  usually complete with ikeastyle incomprehensible assembly instructionsbut you dont really buy kinder surprise for the chocolate you buy it for the little yellow capsule  and before you can get to the surprise inside you have to go through the ordeal of opening it for this you will probably need to enlist the help of a small child or you could be there all dayonce inside you find yourself either a little too excited or slightly disappointed by the contents and unfortunately i was disappointed by this egg i had been hoping for a fully functional selfassembly minature nuclear power station  the kind of kinder toy i

resonable price i know that they dont sell them in the us however i want some with the chocolate shellhi nancy where can i see and buy them please let me knowirene i sent you an email with the pictures please let me know when you get it they are about  inches tall when assembledhello from germany i love kinder surprise i collect more than  years great homepage thanks stefani have recently rediscovered kinder eggs and am eating about  a daythey rockas long as im not a kinder freak illl continuing this not so strage eating habitnot actually too fussed about the toyjust like the chocolate egghere is a kinder haiku this is my gift to you kinder analogy part ivpete i just sent you an email because i got such a laugh out of your messages im going to send you a picture of the toys i have si just returned from germany april nd and of course i brought back some surprise eggs for my grandaughter as i have done in the past for my children welli almost had to give them to the customs people in detroitthis is the most ridiciculous thing i have ever heardthey made me feel like some kind of irresponsible personmy adult children are still alivethey never choked on any of the surprise toys inside the egg the lady customs agent was flipping through her booklettrying to find the part about the eggswell she couldnt find the pageso she let me keep thembut told me that she would never give those eggs to her grandchildrenpoor kidsthey are really missing out on something funbut i guess she probably gives them a quarter or fifty cents and lets them buy a small toy to choke on out a machine in any kmart or walmartin the usa it is illegal to sell candy with a toy inside of it the toy itself is not illegal they state on them ages  and up you can sell a kinder egg in the usa if you first seperete the choclate egg from the toy it kind of ruins the thrill and they are a lot of money i never chewed on toys when i was a kid my daughter is  and smart enough to know a toy doesnt taste good i never seen a kinder toy until i was  years old and when i did i felt like i had found something new and exciting i was in awe i had never seen toys with such craftsmanship vivid attention to detail the blueprints that alone are like mini pieces of artwork and i felt like i wish i had these kinder eggs as a child i feel i would of been a more intelligent person today some of the mechanical toys really makes someone think i have a kinder toy that walk by itself on an angled platform i mean come on who besides a german could come up with something like that i am an antique toy collector for my personal gratification i do not sell my toys so i immediatley took a liking to kinder toys a little bird told me today a story about kinder toys he said that people can find kinder toys on ebay

however being a professional chocolate eater its my duty to buy and consume every bar i see in the shop its a tough jobthe good news is i was pleasantly surprised by this bar its really quite tastythe hazelnuts and currants pieces are small unlike the whole nuts you might find in something like cadbury fruit  nut but they work perfectly  the nuts give a slight crunch to the texture and the currants give a nice chewiness and have a rich full flavour and a natural sweetness that complements the chocolate perfectlyin the end i did end up eating most of this bar in one go  but i did it without noticing in fact this entire review is based on the one final chunk i had left when i realised what id donewhether the fact that you can eat a whole bar without noticing is a good thing or not is debatable but ill certainly be buying this again  although i suspect i may not notice ive bought it until i find the wrapper in the bini know the feeling about reviewing chocolate when youre on your last piece ive finished things a few times before realising i havent actually typed a review up about it yet dohalso being able to eat g of chocolate without really realising it is not a good thing my friend
going on the name and packaging alone i wasnt expecting a lot from this and my expectations were confirmed upon opening itcombined with the chocolate its not that bad but if you let the chocolate melt and then eat the shortcake biscuit its not very nice at all  it could be just about any cheap nobrand chocolate biscuiti imagine this is aimed at the kind of person that picks something up in the moring to to snack on at work during the day the small pack bitesized chocolate biscuit  format would seem ideal for that but unfortunately the product itself doesnt do anything for me i dont think ill be buying this one againbwahaha i beat you to this one i reviewed it about a week ago also nobrand chocoalte biscuit you need to spell check your work sonnyooops  well spotted terry typo corrected i love cadburys snack back the hell off and leave the snack alone  snack for presidentcadbury shortcake snack brings back memories of childhoodused to be quite common in the usa wonderful treatdecades later had it again in irelandreally miss this simple but wonderful snackalong with lindens brownies and chocolate chip cookiesdoes anyone know where i can bt some i live in the midwest usadoes anyone know where i can buy some i live in the midwest usalike gary this cookie candy brings back childhood memories  it was my favorite  they were called cadbury shortcake and had a nice pkg not like the one pictured but then everyone seems to be getting away from the over packaging  i loved them so much i hate to admit it but i often pinched them  next time i am in cost plus world market i will for sure buy a couple to try close my eyes and see if i can be  againfrom one rita to another you took the words write out of my mouth  i just had a twix and the first bite often makes me wish for my old childhood favorite so in vain i thought i did an internet search and found this lovely site  yes i too used to put them in my pocket at times at safeway  i loved the pkging too made it feel so much more special  there is a store near my office that sells lots of imported and old fashtioned candy  will be going there tomorrowlike gary and rita the snacks evoke a childhood memory  i used to walk two or more miles in the heat to the store just to get them for my mom  wish i could still find them  vaughnive been looking for this snack for   years  the last time i was in london i found some packages for sale at a local corner store  ive searched the world over and anytime someone is going abroad i put my request in for cadbury shortbread cholocate biscuiti have been thinking about the cadbury shortcake snacks for some time now and i decided to do a search to see if they still existed i would have never thought that anyone would have had the same love for that snack as i did  as a child in the early s they were my absolute favorite above cookies candy or any other treat  they were  cent  we were very poor so i considered them expensive  every time i could manage to earn save or otherwise scrounge out a dime i would buy a pack and then savor each and every bite  man they were wonderfuli agree   they were my favorite too and lasted longer and tasted so much longer than anything my friends picked plus they were from england which made them seem so exotic and fancy  and then when the beatles became popular that pushed them waaaay over the top funny for some reason i thought they were made with dark chocolate lasted longer tasted better
so why do they make this claim well according to the chart on the back g of this chocolate provides you with  of your rda of magnesium  of your rda of calcium   of your rda of phosphorus and  of your vitamin b unfortunately the bar only weighs g so it might be a somewhat expensive way of getting your vitaminsso why tranquility what else have they addedthe answer is  lavender and lime blossom  bar  three cups of lime blossom teanow i dont know about you but mention lavender and im thinking pot pourri and old ladies its one of those scents that one tends to encounter in large artificial doses certainly not something id have considered as suitable for adding to a high quality milk chocolate i was also wondering how they would manage to get vitamin b into chocolate  after all it has a fairly strong taste in itselfhaving read the packet carefully it was time to open the goods carefully ripping open the plasticfoil wrapper revealed a slim bar divided into  squares horizontally a deep inhalation confirmed the presence of lavender would it taste okay or would i be left gagging like a kid who tried to eat the pot pourria square was broken off and placed  with a degree of trepidation  on my tongue definitely lavender flowery with a slight tang of lime and a strangely bitty texture perhaps the calciumunlike a bar with bits the particles of calciumlavendervitamins actually melted away with the dissolving chocolate leaving a slightly citrus tang as the finishing noteno doubting the quality of the chocolate itself high cocoa content smooth and creamy  everything youd expect from the belgians the crucial matter rests with the added ingredients  do they work together or is this just the work of some crazed new age chocolatier who turned up for work a little the worse for wear after attending a summer festivalthe flavour falls somewhere between sweeties boiled sugar parma violets cream fillings and chocolate with extras its certainly not unpleasant and its definitely unusual but its also quite expensive as a gift idea for the curious chocoholic in your life i think it would work quite well but i dont see it becoming a staple treat in my household certainly not a bar i would spot and say oh yes lets treat ourselves to one of thesei should add that this chocolate bar is unique in that both thing and thing  absolutely hated it neither of them could finish a single square  both ended up spitting it out and making abundany ick urggh yak noisesyes thats right  kidsafe chocolate you can leave this one lying around and it wont be pilfered extra props to newtree for thatthe tranquility bar is fantastic  i have always loved real lavender as a scent and was also surprised to find that i like the flavor as well i discovered the newtree brand at iluvchocolatecom  try the rejoice bar if you can its like a nestles crunch but with orange and of course better chocolatetastes vile all style and no substance i threw most of it away nice idea but doesnt work dont be fooled by the fancy packaging and inflated price it tastes like soap
i was browsing the shelves when i spotted this addition to the excellence range now milk chocolate is not my usual cup of tea but as we all know lindt do make very good choccy and their milk chocolate is one of the better ie more cocoa varietiesi dont know if anyone else does this but i suspect you do but if im eating chocolate with bits in then at some point i will allow the chocolate to melt and then swallow it leaving me with a mouthful of whatever has been suspended in the bar i did this while tasting this bar and was amazed at just how many little nuggets of caramel there were there seemed to be far more than would allow the bar to retain its form although plainly that isnt the casethe caramel itself is very crunchy so crunchy that chewing this chocolate quietly would be almost impossible to do its also very sweet not sugary sweet but more honeysweet and so the mouthful of caramel bits experiment left me feeling a bit oversweetened and wishing id just eaten the bar as lindt intended me to the rich sweetness was a bit much for my palate on its ownthe overall verdict on this bar is that it is made of very high quality ingredients both the chocolate and the caramel are  as one might expect  excellent just dont extract the caramel from the chocolatei do that toothe melting thing i do it with ice cream toohehe i do that too i also umm like to melt mars bars in the microwave for  secs then eat it melted with a forkbut everyones different eh hehe pbest regards ladandoes anyone know if this is still sold in the uki cant find this lindt caramel bar in the supermarkets at allyou may have already had an answer as your post was way back jan   i recently bought some in a shop called boyes in york in the north of england  think ive seen it in tescos as well but cant be positive
i didnt expect much from the small squares of chocolate the point the gimmick as it were is the photographs with the silly captions to appeal to those with a taste of humour each chocolate has a different one all relating to chocolate in some way some witty most at least faintly amusing they are clearly a bit of a gag gift and i didnt expect quality chocolatei did expect it to be edible though the milk chocolate looked nice enough a creamy colour and decent width i broke off a corner and popped it into my mouth without even thinking about it i didnt expect a magical moment but this was just insipid it tasted like someone had bought the absolute cheapest cocoa powder mix they could find the type with lots of sugar and next to no real chocolate mixed it with water and skimmed milk and then found a way to solidify iti know i can be a bit of a chocolate snob so the sensible solution was to get a second opinion i got another square and handed it to my british boyfriend try that he ate it in one gulp and then made a face ew thats terrible he said is it americanall the other chocolates sold by the the house of dorchester look lovely and are clearly aimed upmarket heavens above are sold under license but i couldnt find any other reference to them perhaps house of dorchester felt decent chocolate would be wasted on pranksters more interested in the packaging than the contentits a mystery indeed regardless youve been warned the retro look is interesting and the captions are a giggle but dont expect the chocolate to be anything specialew thats terrible he said is it americanive been there before y helo thar hersheys disgustingwhat do you mean ewis it american okay the only american chocolate id get excited about is from local cholatiers good thing theyre plentiful around heretalking of heaven i got a box of nestle heaven perles for easter and they are absolutly gorrgeous i mean nothing can beat the kit kat peanut butter but omg mmmmmpp
whatever you want to call this egg i called mine kylie its a bit of an oddity its very small g and sits on the shelf in the shop looking a little sorry for itself when in actual fact it should be shouting and making a noiseyou see while it has a few flaws in its design its really rather nicewhen opened the egg splits in half lengthways with each half filled with a delicious creamy truffle except that its not quite filled to the top this is presumably so you can split it in half more easily but in reality it just leaves you feeling a little shortchangedwith a little bit of attention to detail this could easily give cadbury creme egg a run for its money  but in its current form it seems like a bit of a halfhearted effort from lindton the offchance that anyone from lindt is reading this i have some suggestions on how to improve this offering for next easteri look forward to tasting kylies sibling erm next easter until then i might pick up another one of these in passing but i wouldnt go out of my way to buy themwhy buy the egg when you can have a whole lindt lindor chocolate bar you can tell i dont really care much about whether its easter or not  my local tesco has them and they are certainly one of my favourite chocolate treatssylke i can only buy whats in my local shop and my nearest tesco isnt quite within walking distance unfortunately hey the easter eggs in germany are always only half filled i dont know what you want  and i have to say that lindt is the best chocolate brand everi think that this egg should have a real name as my friend asked me  get him a liqour egg from the shop  i had no idea wat this was  me  my other friend have been thinkin hes lost some screws and makin up names of chocolate but three days down the line we have found out thats its a lindor egg doesnt sound as funny as liqour but o well mayb they should call it liqour i myt try  nowas the woman said she named hers kylie but a friend of mine named it a liquor egg so it confused me and my other friend cuz we thought der was alcohol in it funnii story
the wafer and caramel did stick in my teeth but were tasty enough if a little too sweet and the chocolate was typical nestl steadfastly occupying the middle ground between ok and alrightdrifter is a pleasant little snack but the problem is theres just too many bars on the shelves that are too similar and it doesnt stand outim afraid this drifters brothers and sisters are going to be left on the shelves with its wafery caramel fingered friends next timeits clearly a failed attempt at faking a twixomg i love drifter shame i have only ever seen it in packs of  the caramel too me is very soft and is just the right amount of chewyness if that makes sense hahp it compliments the wafer to perfection mmmmsimon  yeah it was a bit chewy  and got stuck in my teeth although mine was quite warm you can tell its the kind of bar that would just shatter or shatter your teeth in cold weatheri want to buy my partner a drifter easter egg and i cant get on any where i cant even get to buy the bar at the minute can you helpi love them too but i havnt seen them any where ive been hunting high and low but no result my little sis said that the caramel part was made from bug poo lmaochocolatelover  how dare you insult the glorious drifteri have just eaten my drifter in about  seconds i blame the fact i was dunking it in my coffee so had to eat it quickly before it dropped in lol
naturally anything called lite as a deliberate misspelling is not legally bound to be lower fat lower sugar lower salt lower anything  it can be compared to labelling a bucket of nuclear waste sayfe enuff for u  also the bar is flatter and slimmer than the regular g dairy milk block so it is designed to make you think it is lighter healthier better  yeah right plus being triple the price per kilogram compared to the good old reliable alwaysthereforyou dairy milk might lure a few suckers in thinking that theyre paying for higher qualitywith this rather negative frame of mind i nervously snapped off a couple of squares and slowly chewed  it was pretty good actually  if it was a blindfold test id still be able to detect that it was cadbury something but know that it wasnt quite as creamy and meltinthe mouth as dairy milk  almost a kind of cheaper easter eggstyle chocolate or the stuff swept up from the floor and then remelted to cover over marshmallows or broken crunchie pieces also known cynically to me as chocettesthen it was time  after inhaling the rest of the g bar  to flip over the wrapper and look at the ingredientswhat on earth is isomalt and polydextrose and what were they doing being the two main ingredients  in addition having powdered milk coming in at number three on the list of ingredients would most certainly indicate that this recipe wouldnt have the standard glass and a half of full cream dairy milk in every g block quality weve all long come to expect from cadburythen it was on to the neversaydie yourfriendtilltheend perenniallyfaithful even though you may wander through the fields of unfaithfulness via lindt nestle baci and haighs  the stayer of them all  cadbury dairy milkalrighty then  so at least i could understand what i was eating  a good old honest serve of milk sugar and cocoa butter with only about g more of fat than the lite version  this had a much better taste but with more carbs and made me realise that the lite version wasnt a patch on the original  it was just being a pale imitation for the carbophobes still amongst uswhats wrong with carbs anyway  hasnt the anticarb coalitionofthewilling since admitted that there were no carbs of mass destruction in our dietary world and that it was fats and sugars that were the main threats to our lives as we knew it  well i hope so  id much rather eat cocoa butter and sugar than isomalt and polydextroseheh the carbs are from the milk those of us lowcarbing it stick to lindt  bars i love chocolateim sorry dairy milk is just too milky for meits a big no no i honestly could not eat another chocolate lump such as this i would rather smother my genitals in fishpaste and dangle them in a pool of pirahnas than eat another chocolate poop like thiswould someone tell me ho many grams of sugar is in a regular bar of dairy milkpweaseumm i thinks it like  or somethingheyy ii love chocolate so much its so umm  im so fat coz ii eat chocolate  anywaiiz im goin to eat  big blocks of chocolate baiiheyy its me again ii love this site it makes me crave for choclate  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxi used to buy cadburys but several years ago it began to taste a little different from the chocolate i had always loved perhaps sacrificing quality a bit to make more profit anyway i rarely buy plain cadbury now preferring the filled varieties and mostly i now go to haighs insteadi dont find cadburys as nice as it used to be it think there must be so much rubbish going into them now its crazy i now buy filled bars as there is less of the choclate in themof course in your review you havent taken any account that this sort of chocolate might have a purpose that being thos of us who are unfortunate to be diabetic not through any fault of our ownso chocolate that isnt carb loaded is essential to us unless you think we just shouldnt have it full stoproy  this kind of chocolate does have a purpose  a marketing purpose and im not convinced its suitable for diabetics anyway theres little point in producing a lite version of a product if it doesnt taste nice youd probably be better off finding a high quality very dark chocolate than filling your body with rubbishoh  and im editor of chocablog and spent six years on a highly restrictive diet while i was on dialysis where chocolate was completely forbiddenso i do have some experience of this kind of thingit is very tastybeing on the low carb diet i use your lite chocolate in alot of receipes for my husbanb and myselfhowever lately i havent been able to purchases it from the super markets could you please let me know if the product will return to the shelves and when and if not is there an alternativeregards margaret kingi love cadbury dairymilkgood writeup i enjoyed your sense of humour listen some people have health problems and they simply do not tolerate sugar well not only diabetics and those with hypoglycemia but people with fibromyalgia have been studied and they usually feel better on a lowcarbohydrate diet all of us in these categories appreciate that the food industry is trying to make good products that we can enjoy especially chocolate please read up on the latest news more and more studies are validating the lowcarbohydrate diet as the best for our health whether you have a health condition or not dr atkins was right good fats olive oil canola oil are not the enemy sugar is considering the weight and health problems that are running rampant all over the world even in poorer countries it is clear that people are eating too much and eating the wrong kind of food sugar and grainsthis review really is not that help full and poorly researched  if you want to tell us not to eat scary isomalt and polydextrosewhy not actually look them up and tell us what is so terrible about them rather than just advising that you like to eat foods you understand your carb rant is stupid while some people do take it to far the fact is that more carbs equal potentially over eating and turning those carbs into fat  im a chocoholic and while the light choc does not taste as good its not that much of a downgrade and compared to other light chocolates on the market its fantastic  polydextrose is soluble fiber  which is good for you and keeps you feeling fuller for longer than regular chocolate the whole report sounds entirely based on opinion if your only research consists of eating some chocolate and you have no knowledge of dieting and the medical conditions that require block of chocolate like this then dont even bother listing the ingredients as you clearly dont know what they actually mean for your body isomalt is an ingredient in artificial sweetener  the largest danger from it is diarrhea if you overeat  and this is not because its poisoning you its just because the body treats it as fiber which when combined with the polydextrose fiber in this chocolate means that you should not eat more than g in one day g for children  there is controversy over the danger of artificial sweeteners  causing headaches and a very long list of other symptoms but there is little conclusive research to back this up and if you try it a react poorly simply stop eating itis there egg in cadbury dairy milkno but there is added palm oil
nutrageous is a fairly long thin bar in a very orange wrapper it certainly stood out on the shelf even though i had no idea what it was but as i took my first bite i noticed three words on the wrapper that stopped me in my trackschocolate flavored coatingbut i neednt have worried this is nicewhich leads me to the filling its pretty much solid whole peanuts held together with caramel and a touch of peanut butter very simple but very very tasty the chocolate may not be real but the nuts certainly arecombined with the caramel they give exactly the right balance of salty and sweet its crunchy chewy and really quite satisfyinginterestingly the picture on the wrapper shows a much rounder bar but i dont think mine was particularly squashed  it just looks like hersheys hired an overoptimistic illustratori was quite prepared to hate this bar but its a really tasty little snack although it looks large its not overly filling  and just the thing to keep you going until lunch timeto anyone that wants to know these can also be found in woolworths and asdaps mars also released these revel type chocolates called mars planets so you should review them im too scared to try them myselfdoes anyone know the nutritional info on a g barthanksi found that site but its for a g bar not the g bar i can get hold of anyone got any infoi cant find any other info but someone else might be able tothanks for looking eating  right now yummy x
it has the perfect balance of minimalist style and a touch of the home made look that lets anyone who receives one know a lot of thought has gone into it its made from a thick matt black craft paper with the simple hotel chocolat logo in silver and a gold label that makes it look like some kind of chocolate trophywhen you do lift the egg out of the remains of the box the first thing you notice is the weight this is seriously heavy g and almost feels solid i guess they werent kidding when they said extra thick shellsinside each half of the egg is stuffed full of large eggshaped dark milk and white chocolate truffles none of the usual small bag of boring nondescript chocolates here no wonder if felt solidthe truffle eggs are simply delicious all different with according to the web site soft ganaches of kir royale marc de champagne bellini kirsch whisky calvados rum amaretto tiramisu and much more yup theyre all alcoholic  but theyre also incredibly soft and creamythe dark chocolate half is as nice as any dark chocolate ive had my only real issue with it is that its quite hard to eat being so thick you either have to smash it on the table or just nibble little bits off it as you cant really just break it in your handsbut the real stars here are definitely the little truffle eggs they look and taste amazing and entirely fill up the centre of the main egg the problem is that theyre so moreish you might just find yourself getting a little tipsyfinally in the interest of full disclosure id like to add that this was a free review sample sent by hotel chocolat but that in no way affects the content of this review it is quite simply one of the most delicious and beautiful things ive ever eaten and i have absolutely no hesitation in thoroughly recommending it if youre tempted to buy this for a loved one this easter i guarantee they will not be disappointedwords are insultingly too deficient to describe the sheer jealousy i feel not only after reading your glorious review but also after visiting hotel chocolats website and realising that theyre not available in australiamillymoo as far as i know theyll deliver to pretty much any countryhissnothing is too good for childrenwow and i thought an easter basket made entirely out of chocolate was somethingwow that looks amazingi am trying to fine this german candy called pralinees excellence with the j d gross name and crest on the box i have had no luck please help for it is really good
you see i like dark chocolate and i even quite like regular kitkats but  often large manufacturers mess up when they create new versions of their best sellers  particularly when upgrading to dark chocolatebut upon opening the wrapper first impressions are good it definitely looks and smells like dark chocolate and the standard slim kitkat fingers look so much better than the bricklike chunky varietiesbreaking a finger off and snapping it in two it somehow feels a little crunchier than a standard milk chocolate kitkat im not sure if thats just my imagination or if it really is crunchier but its certainly not a bad thingits not as smooth as some more expensive dark chocolates i could mention though to me it tastes a little like drinking chocolate  the bittersweet taste is there but it lacks a little of the full chocolateyness youd expect from something more expensivethe back of the packet suggests you dunk your kitkat in your coffee with a helpful picture to illustrate the procedure and while im not really a coffee drinker i could see how this would work you wouldnt want to dip it in too long though or or youd just end up with some kind of soggymochachino snackdrinkoverall this is a nice little snack its not a posh choc and probably wouldnt get this every day either but its a nice little treat for kitkat lovers and dark chocolate lovers alikecompared to a lot of kit kats this ones pretty decent ive been on a right kit kat bender recently and have more coming on the post cant say im looking forward much to melon flavourterry is that one of the japanese varietiesit is yeah i actually dislike melon so i dont know what i was thinking when i decided to buy a pack its not just money i sacrifice in my neverending chocolate adventure as im sure you have no doubt discovered yourselfkit kat chunky peanut butter is by far the best kit kat invention ever made does anyone like the cadburys boost and starbars mmmpboosts are good they were one of the first things i reviewed actuallyi want this in america all we have is regular kit kats and big kats  your chunky  no peanut butter no dark chocolate no cookie dough and its made by hersheys here not nestle  so weird  i must search the airport next time to see if theres any of these international kit kats aroundwhy did kitkat cry because the old makers were a wafer so longlooks like milk chocolate
according to the packet theyre chewy caramel with a milk chocolate centre but the caramel is actually more like toffee its very hard and only becomes chewy when it warms up in your mouthinterestingly to me eclairs started out as toffees they were manufactured by a company called pascalls which were purchased by cadbury in  and launched nationally in the uk in  id always assumed they were much older as i have many childhood memories of getting eclairs stuck in my teethso what are they like well for such a dull looking sweet theyre one of the most moreish things ive ever had the chocolate is bog standard dairy milk the caramel is average and very hard but its the way theyre made that makes them specialthen by the time you get to the chocolate centre its melted and flows out giving you a wonderful chocolate hit thats not quite enough to satisfy you and so you have to eat more and moreif theres one thing ive learned over the years its that you cant keep a big bag of eclairs on your desk and not eat them youll find yourself unwrapping the next one without realising and pretty soon the whole lot will be goneif you dont want to get fat the only solution is to hide the bag at the top of a cupboard and then smack yourself on the head with a frying pan to induce short term memory loss so you cant find themunfortunately i know exactly where the contents of this big bag of eclairs isin my tummy yumwow i feel the exact same way about these unremarkable and yet so bloody moreish they must have an additive in them that makes them like that i wouldnt mind it if they did them in small roll packets like cherry drops or something but in these big bags im not so happy about itthey make a version of these in argentina which they ship all over latin america but they are disappointingly different to the real thing namely the toffee is soft and the chocolate dry i bought a pack and now im craving the real thingoh thats just one of lifes mysteriesi would assume that the chocolate melts at a lower temperature so its somehow injected into the toffee as a liquid but thats just a guess mmmmmm they are soo damn moorishcadburys chocolate eclairs were much nicer when made in great britainwell said

when is posh chocolate not posh does good quality chocolate have to be expensive do you really only get what you pay foras part of my unstinting quest for the best chocolate i decided to visit lidlfor those who are unaware lidl is a pile it high flog it cheap no frills supermarket chain which sells what can only be described as a bizarre assortment of goods for example last week we had a lidl flyer advertising equestrian goods and accessoriesso what prompted me to consider this as a potential source of quality cocoabased goodies well lidl import a lot of their goods from germany and germany  being part of the european continent and neighbour to france and belgium has a good choccy pedigree this despite the fact that as a boy my polish grandmother would give me bars of the worst tasting ersatz chocolate ever created  stuff that doesnt even deserve to be called chcocolate and which probably had never seen a cocoa bean in its short and tragic lifeso in i went on a mission to seewould i come home with something gloriously tasty or would i find the victoria beckham of chocolate  posh in name onlywell i can report that theres an awful lot of confectionery to be had there and most of it consisted of bags of garishly coloured sugar based stuff the likes of which fuel the asbo accumulating hyperactive offspring of council estates across the uk there are also the usual twixalikes kinder bars and eurocopies of well known uk bars  not very appealing at allhowever  nestling in among the nastiness i espied a selection of tall packages embossed with gold writing what appeared to be ecuadorian single estate chocolate  cocoa bingoa quick look at the blurb on the back told me that it was indeed ecuadorian plantation chocolate made from the arriba bean and that the varying tropical climate together with a wealth of experience in the cultivating of this high class cocoa bean gathered over generations and not least the the excellent combining and perfecting of the best  wholesome ingredients are all factors which make up the secret hidden in the blissful depths of the fine j d gross plain chocolatephew  a big enough mouthful in itselfso lets get down to a handson analysis the packaging is very high quality rather than a standard box you get a book type package with a front flap that opens to reveal a gold foil covered bar which slips out to the left the bar itself is a very good looking product large thick squares embossed with the j d gross name and crestthe sniff test confirms the blurb  dark rich coca smells with a slightly bitter edge yumthe chocolate itself is quite simply delicious as good as any i have tasted recently  and that includes the stuff wrapped round the hotel chocolat selection i was given at xmas admittedly the hc fillings were what sets them aside from all other chocolates there is no denying that this is the good stuff proper cocoa rich dark bittersweet loveliness  and all for under presultmy advice  hit your local lidl as soon as possible there are some real treasures in there folksunder p does that mean that this was pive got a lidl down the road from my nans house where i am at the moment on my weekend break from uni i think i might pop down there and stock up on strange german chocolate not sure if i want to though i just got a box of chocolate from cybercandy that needs to be worked throughoh the life of a chocolate blogger isnt easy is itthats why the refrigerator was inventedand dentistsim living in a university dorm mate you put anything in the community fridge and its gone before you know itim there with you frank  lidl in littlehampton had a special offer of the san martin with cocoa nibs mmmmmmm this really does rival a  barwhy dont they always do themi love this chocolate but theres one thing troubles me about the peru equador brazil etc plantation chocolate are these plantations on land that was once amazonian rainforest cleared to plant cocoa trees if so i wouldnt touch it no matter how good it tastesi love chocolates as well and the most important im ecuadorian so i can answer that at least in ecuador the cacao plantations are in the coastal area closer to the pacific ocean and why we have good cocoa because those places were planted since a long time ago some more  years and continue with the tradition so no ecuadorian cacao is not produced in the amazoniaoddly enough i have the trinidad selection here teed up and ready to be publishedgreat minds  or great stomachsmiss charlottei have been buying this stuff for quite some time now  discovered it over a year ago i think the trinidad sticks are fantastic  i have recently picked ups some  mixed with chilli  it was fantastic but they have now sold out  anyone know where else sells this fantastic choc so i can pick up some more  get to lidl and pick up the selection packs they are currently doing btw  heavenin norway the lidl stores are much reviled their products they stock are supposed to be inferior to norwegian products just goes to show that the norwegians dont know what theyre talking about after spending a fortune on foreign chocolates norwegian chocolates are rubbish i cant tell you what a relief it was to a chocaholic like me to walk into a lidl shop and find these wonderful chocolates deutschland ber allesi bought a wonderful bar of dark chocolate in a minimarket in rural norway it had nibs of dried raspberry in it and was wonderful i cannot remember the brand and have been searching for it ever since i think the shop was a spar grocery but im not sure my norwegian relatives have failed to track down any more of this wonderful chocolate perhaps it was some of this rauschgross chocolate you are talking about it was in a gm bar similar to a lindt chocolate bar any suggestionswell i had a  dark chocolate and raspberry bar from marabou when i was in sweden the uk equivalent is made by cote dor and is available in many uk supermarkets give that a gocan anyone tell me if its possible to get jd gross items in the us  my friend brought some home from germany for us  and now im addicted  i cant find it anywhere  is there a store online i can buy it from  i tried the rausch site but couldnt see where i could actually purchase it  please helpthanksextra bitter harika bi tad war thanks jd gross hayatmda yediim en spper ikolata bu too tastes turkeylidl is considered to be the worst market chains in the czech republic i agree but i must say you can find there some outstanding goods like theese chocolates or camambert cheeseive been eating the j d gross lidl bought chocolate for a few month now and as a serious chocolate addict  i only ever like over  and single source chocolate when i can gt it i can heartliy reccomend this to other real chocc fans word of warning though buy in bulk when you find a favorite just not in my local lidl okay   because they only ever get a single box of each  in at a time single estate chocolate doesnt come in nestle style bulkmy hubby has been buying chocolate and lots of other equally yummy things at lidl for some years  i can also recommend the fin carre  edel bitter schokolade dark chocolate for those who prefer milk chocolate their fin carre range in the purple paper sleeve is also good particularly the fruit and nuti discovered jd gross chocolate a few months back in lidl currently im on the san martin peru bar which is really very nice and possibly my favourite of the lot i think it was about  gbp but still pretty good value at thatthe ecuador is also great and the  i found was fantastic for making hot chocolate a bit too intense to be eaten neat for my taste im really quite impressed with the whole range and will definitely keep stocking up when i go back now i just need a horse to take advantage of the equestrian goodswow i love this brand i moved to portugal from the uk with my mum and dad im not really into chocolate but when i found this i had to have it i watched a tv programe called willies wonky chocolate and ever since then was on the look for a high coca content bar and i also discovered this jd gross as i walked around the lidl my mum had draged me in i got the  chilly and wen i ate it i found myself looking it up on the internet sooo it must be good beause i now like chocolate and its good for you and the taste buds go get someeeehiit is a pity that the stor dont put an stickeron the box thanksfor the past few weeks i have been unable to find the  ecuador at my local lidl storehave they stopped selling it or where could i get it in bulk  it is the only chocolate i likelast saturday i found the jd gross ecuador chocolate bars with bits of raspberry and orange in a uk lidl both are good  far better in my view than the chilli and pepper they offered earlier in the year they also had the plain ecuador  hiding behind the much less nice  amazonas the price is p these daysi also am hooked on jd gross chocolate from lidl a couple of months ago i went to selfridges in london oxford street and to my amazement the had a counter selling jd gross chocolates but much much more expensive than in lidl so all you choc lovers enjoy your trip to lidli love jd gross chocolatesexpecially darkbut recently i bought collection superieur g for euro in ireland it contains  types of chocolates and it is realy delicioushey im from ecuador  vinces los rios ecuador  i bought a jd  gross chocolate defenitily is delicious  but i got one quire  suggest however u wanna take it  but the map showing as a publicity in the front is from peru intead of being there the map of ecuador pointing the city or province which is  called los rios and thus  if the history hasnt gone away from my mind los rios province is called the cradle of the cocoa you know the best cocoa in the world anyway  the only thing that is wrong in the chocolate bar  is the map  keep an eye on thatshould change ithave you tried this onehttpwwwflickrcomphotosnjust bought that today i went to hotel chocolat and tried a selection of dark chocolates ranging from  to  cocoa and this tastes just as goodthink ill have to buy a few more bars and also try the  onesmmmmmmmm yummmyi never usually shop in lidl or aldi but went into a local lidl store i was amazed with the selection of dark chocolate i wasnt expecting much in terms of quality but the one i liked the most was a jdgross  with bits of fruit and ground cocoa beans in it stunning chocolate will definately buy againyou can not fault the product jd gross chocolate it a very superior product the kul kul   arrabia  are just fantastic it just shows how we are ripped off by those that say they know better so just like mariliis i have never bought any other chocolate since i discovered the lidl factor esteciocolatadoar ca difera ca si calitate in tara mea nu am gasit ciocolata din astaam primit de la rude si am fost placut surprinsa de gust i agree with the others  nevertheless i thing that there is hardly anything that can beat arriba superieur  edelschocolade  a true connoisseur would never put in his mouth anything called supposedly chocolate that has bits of orange peel or raspeberry in int lidl is considered an inferior shop in slovenia too but right now im enjoying  trinidad and there is nothing inferior about it mmmm dark tasty melts in mouthi love the chocolates  special  ecuador   karamell  superb  delicioso  i am from ecuador guayaquil we do have good products congratulations  where do i get it in arlington texasthe finest and the best chocolate i know and i know a lot of these  all the specialities are interesting but my favorites are the darkest  barlovento and arriba superieur and the so nice kul kulmake the following experiment close your eyes put some of jd gross chocolat in your mouth and let it melt what do you taste after  mins nothing this chocloat is absolutely tasteless make the same experiement with any other known brand and the difference will become very clear i cant believe this is a website about chocolat franchement ca me fait bien rirecant say for the other countries but some of the biggest plantations of cocoa in brazil are around the coast line far from the amazon forest if this is your concern of course it is not  failproof and you might find here and there farms that will use pieces of forestbut i assume that you are european and i would like to ask what is the problem for us to plant what we want where we want you guys dont even have any forest yet but somehow come to lecture us what we should do with ours talk is cheap if you are so concerned you should pressure your government to do more to improve life in poorer countries like brazilindiachinaetci am currently enjoying the ecuador equateur  with caramel bits its my absolute favourite the ecuador  with raspberry bits is also great but i prefer the contrast in texture you experience when slowly degusting the one with the caramel bits enjoyhelp  help  i live in france south ovest cost near la rochelle and in my lidl i dont find my best choice   the kulkul chocolate  from papua new guinea  for me its the bestwhy they dont have that one  the manager said to me that they depend of bordeaux and perhaps i can find it in paris i dont find also barlovento  which is perfect to make a delicious cup of hot chocolate with milkcan you help me thanksthe san martin  cacoa mit kakao nibs is great just googled j d gross to find out about their chocolates available from lidl and came across your website personally i find the ecuador  a little too bitter for my taste but for me the amazonas  not  as colin says is absolutely perfect  neck and neck with cote dor seemingly available only from waitrose now in my viewshhh  as a chocolatier for one of the worlds leading brands i really must applaud lidl on this exceptional product  possibly could do with a tad more vanilla but you would be hard pressed to find a chocolate bar of comparable flavour for under   so as it is only  or so in most european states if you are a bitter chocolate fan just go get you somemy neighbourbt got back from a med holiday brought me back a bar of j d gross  never heard of him i thought as good as any dark chocolate i can recall in my  years tried searching and much to my surprise found all you young things with something to teach this old dogit is the best chocolate i ever eatenthe  percent amazonas is probably the nicest chocolate i have ever hadi just found this blog post and enjoyed reading thru all the chocolate comments i buy this chocolate too at lidl here on canary islands  spain i hope i will also be able to buy the chocolate with beans and chili that sounds interesting since some people americans were asking about an online shop they do have an english webshop and website now its not perfect but i guess it works i would love to know how to get this chocolate in canada  i was recently in portugal and discovered it at lidl and it is the best chocolate i have had  i need  to find it in canada or online so it can be shippedcan anybody tell me plz is it halal or notamei este chocolate tudo de bom quem no provou esta perdendooooooooi love your chocolatein the uk as well as lidil  gross dark chocolatealdi sell a similar chocolate though in my opinion not quite as good similar price sainsbury own brand preferable in taste though unless on special more costly unless on specialrecently at  a barukpopped in to lidl with a pal who shops there on a regular basis not the most eyecatching of displays but thats not the point of lidlits there to provide a no drills service anyways i had a good look around and noticed the  and  jd gross chocolate bars bought a few as i remember having some a couple of years ago at a pals party and never knew that lidl sold them the arriba  is absolutely yummy and i believe the entire range is suitable for veggiesbrilliant and best value chocolate on market had some posh stuff from another source and i can tell you that this lidl brand can hold its own against some of the finest chocolates in the worldwell done lidl ps they had official world cup t shirts on for a fiver brillianti love how the writer of this article feels they have to be disparaging about people who live on council estates as an aside to waffling on about chocolate   how very superior of them
it was not without a sneaking feeling of trepidation that i approached this bar  it has been on the aussie scene for a few months now but with little fanfare  apart from a poster featuring an annanicole smith clone dressed in a tight white nurses uniform above the bar at my local bus shelter it hadnt registered on my oh wow that sounds delicious  i must try it now radar  nor had i heard any rapturous recommendations from any of my fellow chocoholics but that could have been because of the recent christmas bonanzas that were generously thrown our way most especially the special flavours of lindt balls that are often only released during the silly seasonto counteract the disappointment provided by the cookie dough layer the kit kat kreators have added a thin layer of caramel on top of the dough as a kind of consolation prize  the overall effect is that of biting into a chunky kit kat with some kind of indistinguishable sweetish stodgy filling insidei wouldnt trouble myself to buy this again  id prefer to go for the kit kat caramel bar for a fix of extra sweet sticky stuff with extra thick chocolate  at least then id enjoy the fullon flavour of the caramel in a more generous amount than just a thin layer on top of old doughwhat i would rather nestl australia do is forget about these nonappealing flavour combinations and instead try a chunky in dark chocolate  nestle do a beautiful range of familysized dark chocolate blocks so surely they could fling some kit kat chunkys way  if so ill be the first in linewhat a shame when i first saw this on cybercandy i thought it looked really good certainly not worth the crazy prices they charge though ill stick to my peanut butter kit kat chunkys then those things are da bombbut but the peanut butter variety is truly awful im just relieved the cookie dough flavour doesnt appear to be available here in the uki dont know how you can dislike the pb flavour almost everyone i know loves it i know it doesnt taste like real pb but i dont like that stuff much anyway so its an improvement i dont think well be seeing too many new kitkats here in the near future anyway not after the whole temptations product failure the dark chocolate one is good though might have to dedicate a few days to banging out some kitkat reviewsamerican herethe only cookie dough ive ever liked was the bits that came in ben and jerrys ice cream back in the day that was good and really did taste like cookie doughi do concur on eating the cake batter yummy and now that eggs are pasteurized i can give it to my kids do you know where these can be bought in bathi love kitkat cookie doughs sayerah and amyomgwe want to try this we live in the ukwhere can we get one of these will it be avilable in the uk soonplease let us know cookie dough lovers xi loved these so much and completely and utterly disagree with your review the cookie dough was a nice thick gooey consistency with just the right amount of sweetness absolutely loved it and miss it dearly i liked the pb version a lot too but in my opinion this one was betterlet it be an illinformed generalisation so be it  but i am american and ive been eating cookie dough since before eating cookie dough was coolmmmmmmmmpyoure completely correct with this blog post
on the surface this bar looks exactly like the chocolate cream a flattened d shape bar of dark chocolate divided into chunks with the word fry on each piece and as with its sibling the chunks are purely decorative  the filling runs through the length of the bar and you cant really split it along the lines anywaybut this is a good thing you see the problem with a chocolate bar divided into chunks is that it implies you should be sharing it and you really dont want to be sharing thisthe overall effect is delicious and refreshing chocolate bar that leaves you wanting just one more bitestill i do think we should be grateful that the late five centre left behind three wonderful siblings orange chocolate and peppermint cream which are still every bit as good as i remember from my childhoodi just recently discovered frys creams  the orange cream is my favorite  in canada the only place i can find them is in a specialty shopnice to see these bars are still around after all these years the mint and orange cream varieties are available in canada i would like to know what happened to the peppermint and five fruits varietieslove all frys creams you cant beat them but why arent there any frys five centres anymore they should make a big comebackin the uk we get the original chocolate cream the peppermint cream and my fav the orange cream and as before want a five centre they rock can still taste the flavours i used to savour stoo greenockscotlandim a chocahollic and my biggest dissapointment was the discontinuation of the frys five fruits in the early s in my opion the best chocolate ever made i have recently discovered the orange cream which only makes me crave the other four flavours to this day i still wonder why frys stopped producing my five fruits chocolate barapparently the machinery used in the production of five fruits wore out and was too costly to replace but ive never understood that reasoning myself lolthey are available at bulk barn in canadai live in essex in the england and have been in tesco asda co op and cannot find any frys orange or any frys cream bars pls tell me were to buy
green  blacks organic ginger vs waitrose swiss plain with gingeras an interesting diversion and an exercise in selfindulgence naturally i thought id have a little headtohead competition between two similar sounding barsin the red corner we have green  blacks ginger barwaitrose have a reputation for producing very good foodstuffs under their own brand label and although i was not familiar with their chocs i expected it to be a worthy adversary for the might gb the swiss plain chocolate is higher in cocoa content and the ginger pieces arent as sugaredround one appearancegreen  blacks bars are pretty standardised what you get is the stock gb package design colour coded to reflect the contentswaitrose on the other hand offer a tantalising glimpse of a block of their choccy sandwiched between a surgicallyprecisely cut piece of root ginger very tastefully donegreen  blacks chocolate is organic whereas the waitrose bar is not could have a bearing on tastei had to choose one to go first and the privilege went to the newcomer i figured id let the new boy have a go at dazzling me with first impressions the dark swiss chocolate has a good cocoa content and starts to melt almost as soon as it hits the tongue the ginger pieces are a good size  not so large that they overpower the chocolate but not so small that you feel as though the sweepings from a ginger processing plant have been shovelled into the waitrose choccy vatsafter the initial good first impression though i have to say that i closed my eyes popped another square in and went into serious taste mode  and was a little disappointed the chocolate seemed to be lacking that crucial burst of dark cocoa richness that characterises a good quality dark choccy bartime to let the opponent have a go thenluckily the squares of chocolate are roughly similar in size so i repeated the process i popped the first square of green  blacks into my mouth and had a good old chew the first impression i got was that there is an awful lot more sugar in this one the chocolate is sweeter and so is the ginger the fact that its crystallised adds to the sugary hit the second square went in for the gentle melt test and again i was overwhelmed by the sugarinessthis bar was disappointingly sugary  almost to the point of resembling some cheap confection beloved of small hyperactive childrenthe verdicti would say that in an ideal world i would take the ginger pieces from the waitrose bar and mix them with the green  blacks chocolate the gb bar suffers from slightly sweet choccy with added sugary ginger which sent it way off my sweetness scale whereas the waitrose bar lacks chocolatey flavour but has good gingerpersonally i wont be buying either of them again the quest continues for a truly excellent ginger chocolateim just envious that you have blocks of dark chocolate with ginger  all we get down here in oz are candied ginger chunks slathered in godawful compounded chocolate  as such eating a wombat poop is a more attractive optionive never been too fond of ginger or dark chocolate for that matter what were the prices of these  barsi believe the gb bar was  or so and the waitrose bar was a little cheapertry tescos finest with ginger ive tried all of them and i mean all and its by far the best yum yumbelieve it or not i have had one in the queue for a while now watch this blogi believe thorntons do a very good chocolate with ginger but it may be a truffle bar rather than a dark chocolate with ginger pieces  do try it
luckily for us aussies the two words cherry and ripe dont have quite the unsavoury sexual connotations they do in the us ala the porkys videos i remember seeing as an impressionable teenager in  or thereaboutscherry ripes are best enjoyed in winter on the sofa after dinner in front of a good movie  nibbled with alternating slurps of hot herbal tea coffee or  strangely enough  an ice cold shot glass of baileys irish cream  actually theyre pretty good in summer too especially straight from the fridge and go down a treat with the unofficial nonalcoholic beverage of choice in south australia the farmers union iced coffee or fuic for shortmy older brother rob who is as thin as a whippet with legs a flamingo would envy adores cherry ripes  so much so that my father bought a cornershop box of  for his birthday one year  he managed to make them last until his next birthday  a feat of selfrestraint never experienced by this writerhis sisteroowww ur torturin us i totally adore ur blog ud gonna see alot of me around here lol i just realized its cadbury yummy i must say  but i dont think they sale it in uae  not fairhmm cherry covered in dark chocolate eh i know green and blacks do a version of that i think i might buy it i have no doubt itll put this cherry ripe to shameapparently theres something thats not allowed to be in food  in cherry ripes that prevents them being sold in the ukanyone know if this is truewhen we going to see cadburys making and selling cherry ripes in the uk i mean for once its a chocolate that is not full of rubbish its a propper dark chocolate and based on coconuts and cherrysgot to be better than some other snack treats available in the ukfor the uk its time for something different cherry ripeplus i just eaten my last bar now got to wait till my parcel from oz arrives with fresh supplies my roomate from australia gave me one of these and i cant get enough it i wanted them so badly i asked cadburys to sell them in the states but cant be done sighi had a baby cherryripe for the first time in months the other day still as good as the first one i ate about  years agomass commercial stuff but still yummyhahah you right these cherryripes are heaven  haha i was an itern in australi and all my friend told me to taste a cherryripe  i was hooked right away p and by the way it realy was a good breakfast hahah lazy student i dint like to make breakfast  i love uhm p ddyou can buy them at australian shops or from the australian catalog company in the us  be prepared to pay thoughcan anyone please send me some cherry ripes here to norway i am suffering because i have not had one since theyre similar but not the same although jamesons were owned by a subsidiary of cadbury for a whilei guess if you like ruffle youd like cherry ripe too thoughorderedit feels weird to read these comments im from oz and have grown up eating cherry ripes i love them but am sick of all the australian chocolates i wish we could have the same ones as the us and uk lol id give my aussie chocolates up for awhile just to have peanut butter cups and pop tarts etc you can get them at speciality lolly shops but theyre so expensive double the price of the aussie sweetsand the cherry ripe biscuits they had out a few years ago oh my god soooo good biscuit base topped with cherry ripe filling and coated in dark chocolate they were divinei came to this fun post looking for info on this aussie specialty as its a prominent character in a book im reading stranger house by reginald hill dying to try one now and suggest anyone who loves them should get hold of the booktry this site out they seem to be out of stock at the moment but they are located in cincinnati oh and are fairly inexpensive  there is also a way to notify the purveyor that they are out of an item you would likehttpwwwsimplyozcomproductsaustralianfoodssweetslollieschocolatebarsi just found a really good site selling cadbury cherry ripe in the uklunares rojos encapuchado largo por la chaqueta la versin de espesor del tipo clido atractiva linda chica modelo juguetn relleno sabor muy atractivo oh en el interior del vestido de suter paseo con medias y botas era invencible delgadai think behr paint behrcom has something like that but i beivele there is a  fee  ive not used it but i have looked at colors on the website before  also you can pick up the paint bookletschips at home depot from behr and the booklets has complimentary colors and shows the paint in different roomsi personally like the behr paint semi gloss because its wonderful for being able to clean it  especially with kids and crayons markers finger paints etc  it is a little costlier than most paints but it covers great and last great  also if you use the behr paint and there is something wrong with the paint itself a behr representative will come out and paint your walls for you there has to be something
anyway the basic design of the mars bar hasnt changed much over the years malt nougat topped with caramel and coated in milk chocolate and there really isnt any need to change it because frankly its perfect for what it isa mars bar is what you buy when you want a quick snack on the move or an energy boost for those long afternoons in the office sure there are hundreds of similar chocolate bars in the shops but none do the trick quite like a mars bar its chewy filling and very sweetwhich brings me on to the advertising or more precisely the old advertising slogan a mars a day helps you work rest and play genius thats exactly what mars does and you have to wonder why they changed it for a series of wishywashy meaningless slogans i couldnt even tell you what the current slogandujour is and i dont really care mars commercialand there was that french translation  une barre mars par jour au travail au repos et dans les loisirs  i can even remember the way i used to hold it as in your you tube ad video  quite sexythanks for clearing that upits not as confusing as it used to be they discontinued the mars bar the nutty one about seven years ago so soon americans will forget all about it personally i think milky way is a better name for the bar because of the fluffy malted milk nougat and milk chocolate coating i prefer them in the mini sizes something about there being more chocolateah good old slough  actually wernham hogg the paper merchants in ricky gervais brilliant comedy were based in slough  damn shame it was fictionala mars a day keeps the dentist in pay as i used to say when i lived in the ukpersonally i think milky way is a better name for the bar because of the fluffy malted milk nougat and milk chocolate coatingbut our milky ways are fluffy and coated in milk chocolate theyre like mars bars only with a white fluff and no caramel and theyre smallerlol have you tried a deep fried mars barmmm i love mars bars there like the twix always on the shelf and you dont think of them until you eat one and think how did i forget this barpphas anyone tried mars planets if so what are they likewhat are mars planets like  my friends all say theyre not that nice cos theyre just like split up mars bars and only taste as good if you stuff them all in together so ive been trying to avoid themthey sound like a less interesting version of revels too but far less fun trying to work out whether the one youve picked out is one of the ones you like mmmm coffee flavour  personally ill stick to the mars bar itselffreakyfriend that is essentially what mars planets are one has nougat one has crispy stuff mars delight and i forget the other but theyre all pretty poor on their ownmmm strange enough as i am i would love to try a white chocolate mars bar mmm pbut to be honest i think im standing alone on this one lol pme love marsbut milkyway is sooooo much better these are only good when they are frozen solidi love mars bars and if you eat one with a bag of peanuts you get a marathonmmmmmmmmmi used to love mars bars until i found out it was them that caused my migranes what can u do for people like me who would love a mars but cant because they give very bad migranes email back to me asap thanks look forward to your commentshi trevor i started eating mars bars in the last  weeks because all the supermarkets had them on a very good deali ate  per day sometimes for an energy boosti started getting really bad head aches and sore eyesi looked into it and it is caused by the sugar in them   a g mars bar contains g of sugar  no wonder mars bars

love mars chocolatesi never in my life have tried a mars barbut it sounds goodpsawesome websitecan i have mars bar is it ok as i cant have gluten please helpawesome thanks mate author may want to check his facts to say the design of the mars bar hasnt changed is not true  back in the s and possibly into the s the mars bar was a flat bar with the almonds running along the top usually about five or six of them  i liked it better because it had less nougat and was more chocolate and almonds it wasnt the narrow fat bar such as the current milky way but it was wider and flatter  it was so much better back then  when they changed the shape it changed the taste  i wish they would bring the old mars bar backyeah the mars bar is back i bought two at walmart yesterday as did the guy in line in front of mei just purchased a box of mars chocolate almond bars in the tan wrapper while visiting a walmart in katy texas houston creamy chocolate whole almonds soft nugget like in milky way not like snickersand caramel snickers are not the same even when they say with almonds they are still snickers  the orginal mars bar is better  i used to get one occassionally when i rode the entire school bus route with my dad as a child  they were the  wide bars with almonds on top  the wrapper was a translucent pale green wax paper material  mars bar was in yellow letters and cost  cents  snickers and milky ways were  cents  same wrapping but with snickers in blue and milky way in greeni am so glad that they brought back the real mars bar tan wrapper i almost suffered a heart attack in walmart yesterday when i saw themi bought three and stored them in my freezer i will go back and get more since this i believe are in limited supply plus theyre only  its been years since i had one and was heartbroke when the website said the the snickers almond was the replacementi posted my comment prior to reading the posts above mine sorry about that but why contract with only walmart walmart is one of the worst businesses out there i only shop there because it is so cheap if i made more money i would boycott walmart except of course for having to go there to purchase mars barslike the poster

that they have always been my favorite candy bar i now have my girlfriend addicted lol hope these are here to staymy wife got back from being out shopping  she asked me to close my eyes and open my mouth  she put a candy bar into my mouth and omg it was a mars bar  i nearly fainted out of pleasure  we live in thousand oaks ca but the nearest walmart is neighboring simi valley  they sell a

no i havent just banged my head on the keyboard or typed random letters in no particular order thats what this chocolate is calledone of the benefits of this is that you can buy polish food just about anywhere this little bar came from my local sweet shop and although i had no idea what it was when i bought it i swear it jumped up and down saying buy me when it saw me lookinglittle did i know i was buying one of the nicest chocolates ive tasted all yearas far as i can make out a rough translation of the name is classic bitter caramel and thats exactly what this is a wonderful dark chocolate with a heavenly fillingbut the real surprise is the filling its a soft creamy caramel made with condensed milk and its absolutely packed with flavour it has a slightly smokey slightly custardy flavour  the closest taste comparison i can think of is to something like a crme caramel its smooth to the point of being silky and its utterly utterly divine nothing like the slightly heated corn syrup that often passes for caramel these daysbeing imported from eastern europe the price was great too at p for a g bar this is absolutely something ill be buying againrotfl  these chocolate names really are so hard to pronounce its just means its classic bitter with caramel from goplana great blog anyway i wish i was a few years younger and few hundreds chocolates lighter to have my ownwhere can i find gorzka candy bars in chicagolandmatt you can buy goplana bars at the butera market in algonquinprobably at the others too in their polish sectionthis sounds beautiful dom where did you purchase this i would love to trythis review was  years ago but i found them in my local newsagent at the time you might be able to find them online somewhere google the name or you might just have to find a polish friend
as with the peppermint patties these are substantial chocolates sanders obviously like to make em bigbut i find myself in two minds about these on one level theyre quite tasty filling chocs but on another level im not convinced they belong is a box with premiere chocolatier written on itthats not necessarily a bad thing  i buy mars bars out of choice quite regularly and it certainly didnt stop me polishing off the whole box in a few days but this isnt really aimed at the everydaycandybar marketi think maybe youd get these to share with the family or casual visitors rather than buy them as a gift theyre nice enough just a touch ordinaryhi domlove the idea the chocolate is an indulgeance of no esteem blog on
this is a difficult delicacy to describe  kind of the chocolate version of our iconic deep fried chicoroll and about as old in origin not manufacture or useby date  it is a long tube of marshmallow encased in an icecreamcone crunchy waffle which is then dipped in a generously thick layer of chocolatewhere the polly part of the name comes from is steeped mystery  ive spent hours wondering about it  no not really just the second or two it takes me to rip open the end of the wrapped and and stuff pw into my mouth to crack through the coating and into the hidden white pillowy depths inside  maybe polly was the chocolatemakers daughter or wife or dog or it just sounded kind of quirky in front of waffle  anyhow the phrase polly waffle has been used in tacky aussie rules football commentating circles to describe time wasting by players  hes busy pollywaffling with the ball because none of his team mates are able to lead out in frontat grams in weight it is slightly on the bigger side of the standard chocolate bar and is considerably longer than average due to the lightness of its main ingredient the mallow from the marshes on a side note it reminds me of the infamous nude fight scene in borat this bar is the size of borats optimistically censored out  errmmm love truncheonputting borat completely out of our minds now and back to the original subject i have tried to use the polly waffle has been used to fool myself psychologically  for example if i am truly ravenous am dying to eat chocolate yet still want to be able to view my own belly button i go for a big bad boy like this in an attempt to convince my stomach and eyes that they have imbibed the equivalent of a tree trunk  size does matter in the case of polly waffleif that doesnt work i just inhale another  after all it is mostly marshmallow and theyve got less fat in them than the average chocolate bari really cant get the borat image from my mind now  and i really am trying this was going so well too  i like the sound of this pollywaffle and what a great name i think i might get a budge or a rabbit just so that i can call it pollywaffle reading your post i feel like homer simpson drooling over a duff beer commercial  i got hooked on polly waffles during a trip down under in   ever since i returned ive tried to find a source for these delicacies here in canada  but no luck  a polly waffle  a polly waffle  my kingdom for a polly waffle  okay i dont actually have a kingdom but i would kill for a polly wafflepolly waffle is being discontinued  no more are being madei agree with you i just emailed them the another day and told them i have had a craving for the for quite sometime and its not fair so i tried to make something similar but not as goodive noticed since its been announced that they will be discontinued all the stores i used to buy them at in the melbourne cbd have sold out there werent many anyway as no where seemed to stock themcome on nestl you have a great product that is an australian icon of chocolate just advertise it buy some decent shelf space in all the s and watch sales skyrocket
you americans are so funny you have a word for everythingpatties for instance thats not really a word we use here in the uk and for some reason it just makes me laugh when i read it if these were marketed in the uk theyd simply be dark chocolate peppermints or maybe after dinner mintsthe chocolate is smooth and rich  the box doesnt give the cocoa content but it has a nice bittersweet taste its also nice and thick as after dinner mints go these are quite substantialnow all i need to do is get myself invited to a dinner party  anyonepattie makes me think of spongebob squarepants and his krabby patties i can do all the voices from spongebob squarepants by the way old proverb beans on toast doth not a dinner party make  id love to share but i appear to have accidentally eaten them all oopsim originally from detroit mi and sanders was and i think still is made there they used to have free standing shops that served ladies lunches and hand dipped milkshakes midwest definition but they were most famous for their ice cream filled cream puffs topped with their awesome chocolate fudge sauce  the company went out of business for a while so all the soda fountains were closed but someone but the name and the recipes and started making their products again much to the everlasting delight of a generation of michiganians
when i think of topic i always think of the line a hazelnut in every bite admittedly my mind then connects to the playground joke that followed this advertising line q what has a hazelnut in every bite a squirrel poo strangely this never put me off topics as a kid and doesnt now although i think maybe it shouldwith the promise of a hazelnut actually being in every bite i put it to the test when i daintily devoured my topic first bite no hazelnut second bite hmm maybe there was tiny piece in that one third fourth and fifth definitely tiny pieces in these bites rather disappointing that i hadnt so far actually munched on a whole hazelnut but to be fair by now the hazelnut flavour was so clearly present and mixed with the tastes of milk chocolate soft nougat and smooth caramel this was now a bar to savour what a shame there was only one biteful remaining the last bite at last at least  decent sized hazelnut piecesive just discovered on wikipediea that in  there were a series of advertisements for topic with the strapline a joy to eat but a bitch to make i wish id heard these adverts worryingly im not aware of any advertising campaign sincethe packing used to be made from paper which tore ahhhh and in a much darker redsepatu adidas f adizero adalah inovasi terbaru dari adidas yang diklaim merupakan sepatu sepakbola paling ringan di dunia sepatu futsal yang didesign oleh perusahaan terkenal di dunia ini hanya memiliki berat  gr versi kulit sintetik teknologi bahan sprintskin terbaru digunakan pada adidas f adizero teknologi dengan lapisan sintetis microfibre polyurethane digunakan untuk mengurangi berat sepatu dan memberikan kenyamanan yang maksimal di kaki para pemain  ketika anda bermain bola dengan menggunakan sepatu ini anda seakan bermain bola tanpa menggunaka sepatu karena design sepatu yang tipis tapi memberikan kekuatan dan perlindungan yang maksimal hal ini disebabkan penggunaan teknologi poliuretana thermo tpu band di dinding dalam yang memberikan kekuatan tetapi tidak membuat pemakai merasa terbebani oleh sepatu tersebut  teknologi lain yang digunakan dalam f adizero adalah teknologi parallel lacing asimetris yang akan memberikan surface menendang yang luas agar bisa mempermudah para pemain dalam mengolah bola secara optimal selain itu pada sepatu futsal adidas f adizero ini terdapat lubanglubang ultra light insole untuk mengoptimalkan kecepatan dan pengurangan bobot sepatu tersebut  design outsole membuat tumit akan terkunci sehingga gesekan antara sepatu dengan tumit tidak akan terjadi dan menghasilkan kecepatan lari yang maksimal penggabungan teknologi outsole sprint frame dengan threedimensional bridges dalam sepatu futsal f adizero menciptakan stabilitas yang maksimal  sepatu ini tidak hanya mengutamakan tentang teknologi dalam hal bobot sepatu kekuatan stabilitas dan kecepatan tetapi juga memberikan tampilan style yang sangat bagus orang hanya butuh waktu sekilas saja untuk menyadari bahwa anda sedang memakai produk adidas penggabungan antara teknologi dan gaya dilakukan dengan begitu sempurna menghasilkan produk yang berkualitas tinggi  sepatu sepakbola paling ringan di dunia saat ini diwujudkan melalui suatu kerjasama dengan beberapa pemain sepakbola top dunia yaitu lionel messi dan david villa serta beberapa pemain lainnya seperti kita ketahui bahwa david villa menggunakan sepatu f adizero ini ketika memenangkan pialan dunia  di afrika selatan  toko sepatu online jual sepatu dengan bermacammacam jenis dan merk dapatkan sepatu berkualitas tinggi dengan harga murah di toko sepatu onlineafter the hype that surrounded nightcall featured in the incredibly and justifiably popular film drive kavinskys follow up was always going to be a tough task but the french boy done good and with a carthemed lp out in feb as well outrun exciting times beats outlet
the fact is we simply cant resist good quality every day chocolate with interesting fillings but for those of you who do think were a little ritter mad ill try and keep this one shortthe raisins are plump and juicy and taste like theyve been soaked in the rum for a month they have so much flavour the hazelnuts add a little crunch and texture and the chocolate  as youd expect  is deliciousso there you have it ritter sport rum raisins hazelnuts the perfect gift for that special chocaholicalchohic person in your life yumi told you they were awesomerum raisins and hazelnuts now youre talkinghic a friend brought me one from germany  one that has real rum in it there are two versions sold here in the states depending on where you live because of our puritan alcohol laws most are only rum flavored the real rum though whooo thats sassydoes anyone know why the rum raisin bar has disappeared from the stores  i was so addicted to it and now its gone  ive emailed the ritter chocolate company three times and they have yet to respondis there a version of rum raisin chocolate bar with dark chocolatei dont care about the hazelnuts even though theyre nicewhat i want is rum raisin with dark chocolateespecially if i can buy it in nyc or by mail

yeah yeah i know the old joke about aussies  whats the difference between an australia and a tub of yoghurt  after three days the yoghurt develops culture  hah hardy hahin the case of tim tam biscuits however us aussies seemed to have embraced them in a far more exuberant way than you great british folk have  in your neck of the woods theyre known as penguin bars individually wrapped and likely to be mostly found in kids play lunches or at the back of the pantry cupboard  after all what adult could be bothered unwrapping the blasted thingssomehow good old arnotts biscuits now owned by a us company but for all intents and purposes are as australian as vegemite  also now in us hands have got the formula just right  high quality greaseless milk chocolate covering two perfectly crunchy biscuits with a lighter chocolate moussestyle cream filling in the middle  one bite and youll be as hooked as the rest of us  clive james sucks out the middle and drinks his cuppa tea through them  germaine greer inserts them between her ears and elle mcpherson has her body to thank for them and the freakish gift of good genes and the body of a preying mantis  interestingly all three of them now live in london  perhaps it is so they can seek some refuge from the siren song of the tim tam  after all if clive got any larger his eyes would permanently be hidden under flesh folds germaine wouldnt be able to spout off her regular rounds of demented verbal diarrhoea and elle might be tempted to try her hand at acting again and release another workout videoyour own kind the poms who are out here love them nonfamous aussies over there or up there if you insist on being hemispherecentric get them posted over by their parents because the poncy little penguins just dont measure up  when i lived in the uk for a couple of years it always reminded me of teenage sex when that aussie post softpak arrived by the door  it was attractive complete with brightlydesigned aussie stamps on it  the anticipation was there the ogling the stroking the grappling the unwrapping the final revealing moments only to discover that theyd been sat on and melted in transit and the brown pillows of ecstasy had been welded together to resemble a solid brick turd  oh wellover here folks theyre everywhere and always at their best kind of like hugh jackman but easier cheaper and much more available  at least one of the three local supermarkets within walking distance of my workplace has them on special at any given time  usually for less than two bucks a packet which i think is about a sixpence for you folks based on historical currency comparisonspush those greedy guzzlers aside and inhale of the tim tams all by yourself  as loreal is always fond of telling us do it because youre worth ittimtamand not only because youre worth it theres another reason for scoffing the lot which has stumped the best brains down under for many a year the bloody biscuit maker has seen fit to put eleven of gods own culinary creations into each packet  eleven is a prime number which for the mathematicallyretarded amongst us means that it is not divisible by any other number this more importantly means that if you dare share them with your loved one whilst slumped watching telly on the couch or in a trio or group of four over morning coffee there will always be a lone tim tam waitingwaiting to be noticed  waiting for the sly sidewards looks and waiting for the most desperate person to actually come out and say you dont really want the last one do you before pandemonium violence tears and recriminations break out  marriages friendships and families have broken up over it and im hoping to convince the sociology professor i work for to start researching the tim tam chaos theory of social breakdown in contemporary australiashe said shed think about it but only if i bought a packet in each and every morning to help her write the funding grant applicationoooohh ive only recently acquired them from a relative in perth amazingly good for something so simple i found myself reaching for the next piece n the next  without even even realizing itbut some might find it a tad bit too sweeta few years ago natalie imbruglia was on so graham norton and she shared the whole timtam and tea tricki found some and now thats one of my favorite treatswe do have these in the uk  at least we used to they were reviewed on nicecupofteaandasitdowncom a couple of years agoi like chocolate as much as anybody eating the yummy stuff on a daily basis but oddly enough i dont like timtams i find them an overload of sweethi im a big fan of chocoblog i live in australia and i love tim tams they are fantastic i miss them so much as i have been diagnosed with celiac disease and now some things will have to be mere memories but i think i could almost take a stomach ache for a tim tam once in a while yummytim tams are amazing i love the original tim tams so much however think that they need more chocolate i love my chocolate thick but dont worry as arnotts have sorted that for any chocoholics with their double coatthey also stock a wide variety of tim tam flavours
here clutched in my overworked hands is one finger of twix one individual chocolate covered caramel and biscuit finger a single bar of pleasure a solitary slab of delight restricted in its own individual wrapper it is separated from the rest of the chocaworld it is secluded and lonelyso why did i buy individual fingers of twix instead of the usual twin bar because the packet said  chocolate biscuit bars plus  extra free free in the same sentence as chocolate the sweetest words do delighti like twix you know where you are with twix if twix were a man id probably settle down with him unless the twin bar thing meant he had a split personality then id have to dump him but if it meant he had a twin brother who i quite legitimately kept confusing him for then where was i twix nice chocolate smooth caramel and just the right amount of biscuit you cant go wrongnow you have to bear in mind that im talking about the twix in my life sure there is now a dark chocolate version but i shall remain faithful to my milk chocolate twix thank you very much no doubt there will be a peanutbutter version in the states and if any of our friends across the pond would like to report on this i would be ever so gratefultwix hides quietly in the corner of the chocolatedisplay in the sweet shop it doesnt shout out at you like some of its sparkly foiled chocafriends it waits until you remember it exists and then you wonder why you left it so longtwix is chocolatey caramely biscuity and it fills you up until your next bar of chocolateerm i mean until your next substantial meal job donehey i just wanted to tell you that i really enjoy your blog particularly how you talk to the candy in your reviews  i find it quite amusing  its nice to see what candies are available across the pondkeep up the good workweve had a peanut butter version in the states for a few years i prefer it actually the peanut butter is similar to that in a reeses cup sweet salt and somewhat grainy definitely try to get your hands on some if you can i would like to ask a question about your twix product please can you tell me if twix has got animal rennet in it as i have heard this on bbc news your response would be greatly appreciated thankyoummm twix my favourite chocolate bar how about lobbying for the twix meant to be commercial that features the song happy together to be shown in the statesi am the actor in the commercial and could really use the residual money from a us national commerciali must go get a twix now and a cup of teaplease can you let me know if twix is suitable for vegetariansi absolutely love twix for many years it was my favourite chocolate bar something about the biscuit flavour and the way it blends with the smooth sweet caramel the mix is just perfect yumhappy new year twix is very good here in the united states you can get twix pb in pc or pc i dont know if yall in britain can get a pc normal twix but atleast we and you have twix ice creami used to love twix until i found out it is made of palm oil  palm oil is made from oil palms which are planted plantation style in indonesia  where shelter and life for orangutans and the sumatran tiger once existed there are now kilometres of  palm oil plantations  i am boycotting kitkat mars snickers twix and turtles because they contain palm oilah the twix i still love twixs but their popularity seems to be lessening with the return of wispa and aero caramelthey are simple yet lovely the caramel is simply the best parti love twix so much  it is so freaking goodtwix is my best chocolate 
yes packaginguntil recently smarties came in a thick cylindrical cardboard tube with a popoff plastic lid the lids came in different colours and each had a letter of the alphabet embossed on it collect the lids and make rude words  what more could a kid ask forthen in  everything changed nestl announced they were replacing the packaging with thin hexagonal tubes and no plastic lid we were told this was to keep the brand fresh but the real reason was cost these lighter plasticfree packages are cheaper to produce and can be stacked more efficiently in boxes saving space and transportation costs pahso is the new packaging really that bad well no but theyre just not smarties any more nestl messed with a british institution and completely destroyed it will they ever return to the cylindrical tubes frankly i doubt it but only smarties have the answerend of rantoh my god what have they donei use to spend hours putting the lid on and seeing how i could make it fly by squeezing the tube i feel your pain someone get me a paper bagthese days smarties have to be hidden at the top of my cupboard only to be eaten by me once my son is safely out of the way ever since that day  years ago when son was  yrs old and someone gave him  smarties oh what fun we had that day have you ever seen a four yr old climb the walls literally the curtains and track crashed to the floor the sofa cushions landed on the cat who left home for a few days as a resultlego landed amidst the shoes that ended up strewn across the hallway the elderly neighbours came out to help and between us we restrained and walked the  yr old smartie additive junky up and down the street until the smartie drugs were out of his system oh yes  what a day that wasthe new packaging is a travesty  and i say that as an exemployee okay i worked in food  beverage and not confectionary but heyim quite gutted that my kids will never know the joys of collecting smartie lidshmmm not sure i agree that smarties taste better than mms  perhaps they do in the the uk but here in oz the chocolate they have inside the shell would equate to a compressed bird turdsadly though we never got ours in tubes just boring little rectangular boxes  ironically the same size as toothpaste cartonswow i have to say that until i read this post i never knew that smarties could be had anywhere other than canada  and in a tube  you brits get all the fun  mind you i still remember the flat card boxes that would squeak and squawk when we exhaled forcefully through them after the smarties were gone  until some angry parentschoolteacher convinced the smartypeople to make the boxes without the squeak  shame thatwhen you eat your smarties do you eat the red ones lastoh the tubes the tubes we had them here in portugal too and the plastic lids theres no fun in the hexagonal boxwe just bought some of your smarties from a dollar store we bought them because we thought there was a contest for a smart car to be won but when we went to the website to enter our pin the contest was long over i am complaining to tell u to put an expiry date in big letters on the front of ur containers so that we don waste our money on contests we can not win thank you for having read this letter please take it into consideration for next time also you should have an expiry date on ur smartie boxs and a comment board on ur main website i enjoy smarties but may just stop buying them if this continuesi remember the tubes with the little laetters on the lid d they were much better when i was a ickle kid i used to collect them hahawe still have the round tubes in sweden however long that will lasthow sad am i looking for a website so i can have a moan at the new smarties  but low and behold i am not the only one i totally miss the pop off lids my children will never experience the hours of fun they brought but then again gone are the days of kids finding fun in small mundane thingsi used to buy them in the box that way i could eat more for my money but you dont get them any more either i dont know how i ended up only  stone and not  but my problem is the new no artificial colours ok i must be silly or thick because how do they make them the same colour and secondly they taste rank man i love smarties but they dont even taste very nice now bring back the artificial ones even if it does make the kids go nuts let us have the choice of one or the other i used to suck the shell off then eat the chocolate but now the shell tastes really nasty no i mean it really nasty lastly who else used to put them on the radiator so when you squeezed one between your tongue and the roof of your mouth it popped melted chocolatei too agree with that comment about the smart car contest being over at my work we just opened up a huge box of smarties to be put on the shelves and they were the smart car contest boxes of course comsumers will be upset when they find out that the contest ended six months ago i can completely understand trying to get rid of the abundance of product but six months later still an expiry date would help a whole lot on principle it is wise not to consume or purchase any nestle products whatsoever   is the th anniversary of the nestle boycott  nestle and other baby formula manufacturers continue to irresponsibly market baby formula products in developing countries which they deny consequently this leads to serious illness suffering and death for many infants due to unsanitary conditions in which feeds are prepared  for futher information visit ibfan international baby food action network and babymilkaction websites  charities which monitor and report violations of the world health organisations international code of marketing of breastmilk substitutes eat cadburys instead far yummier chocolate anyway cadburys bubbles beat aero hands downi agree even though they are now owned by mondelez international cadbury chocolate beats nestl chocolate hands down specifically crunchieshow lond does is take to make a damn smartiehow long does is take to make a damn smartiehow long does it take to make a freakin smartiehow long does it take to make a smartiei have a question i am from canada and noticed that our smarties come in a rectangle box but how come the packages within the uk are tube shapes or even hexigonal shape why is canada the only place in the world that doesnt get those unique packagesi got my pink smarties and their colours were all different if you buy pink smarties you expect pink smarties not ordinary smarties godi hate  the new taste box and really understand that hat you dont know what you have till its gone i didnt think i would miss smarties so muchbring back the lids  i havent bought a pack since they stopped the lidsi love jessica and kaylin they r so cute and smarties r so awsome dudes ayayyayayayayaya doy hahahah lolololololololololo oopsidasysmarties r koole and like totly awsom but chips t beterishhow sad am i looking for a website so i can have a moan at the new smarties but low and behold i am not the only one i totally miss the pop off lids my children will never experience the hours of fun they brought but then again gone are the days of kids finding fun in small mundane thingsi used to buy them in the box that way i could eat more for my money but you dont get them any more either i dont know how i

but they dont even taste very nice now bring back the artificial ones even if it does make the kids go nuts let us have the choice of one or the other i used to suck the shell off then eat the chocolate but now the shell tastes really nasty no i mean it really nasty lastly who else used to put them on the radiator so when you squeezed one between your tongue and the roof of your mouth it popped melted chocolateim eating some right now from a stupid hexagonal box eating light blue smarties that used to be dark blue and realising that the chocolate inside them is now actually disgusting  all i remember was that different coloured smarties had different chocolate inside dark brown and yellow had dark choc and the lighter colours had milk may kave been a medium one too but too long ago to remember ps the plastic top clicked onto my school blazer buttons in  memoriesthe chocolate tastes disgusting nowor is it the shellsthe chocolate is vile in smarties now nestle chocolate as a whole is beyond nasty and has been for years as they changed the ingredients to cut costsextend shelf life oil instead of butter and so on only regular kitkats seems to still taste ok out of all of nestles productsthe new no artificial colours smarties taste like chemicals and death horrible flavours now  i cant stand them anymore the brown ones are the worst  one of the first times in my life that ive spit food out of my mouth nestles faq states the taste is the same  thats a bald faced lie nestle is eviljust got back from visit in canada and brought back our usual stash of canadian candy  my kids and i eagerly tore into the box only to discover that our beloved smarties taste different and not in a good way  how sadi used to eat  tubes of smarties a day before nestle bought out  rowntree the original manufactures of smarties and many other well known products nestle chocolate always had a slighly stronger cocoa taste than british chocolate which was a mainly european tastei recently purchased a tube of smarties in their new hexogan tube and apart from changing the packaging i am positive that they have also swopped the chocolate recipe in favour of nestle recipe which tastes stronger than rowntrees original chocolateif nestle have done this after buying the rowntree company then that is the same as buying harry ramsdens fish and chip franchise and changing the batter recipe to which ramsdens are famous forif so i do not think his was a smartie move by nestleare mms okayive had  packets of smarties in the last few months like bobyjoejoe above mentioned i used to suck the shell off them as well this was nice it left the middle all melted and delicious i tried this with the new ones and at first i thought the shell tasted a little bit like honey until i realised about half a pack in it was a lot closer to sea water all salty and horrible my childhood died in that momentactually the idea that they could come in a hexagonal or circular tube or tube at all is pretty coolin canada weve only ever had them come in rectangular prismshow can i buy smarties wo paying for the  shipping fee from the uk  i want to buy them for my canadian bf for christmaswait smarties were a good brand before cadbury sold it to nestl in  remember the slogans they were a handful of smarties everyday will keep the blues away and they dont melt in your hand they melt in your mouth they also did not have blue smarties nor the orange flavoring in orange smarties the full name was cadburys smarties chocolate beans there were  smarties per color and they were very popularcadbury sold kitkat smarties aero and caramac to nestl in july of  due to bankruptcy nestl was of course inferiornone of what you have said here is true in any way it doesnt take that much effort to do a bit of researchi understand but i seem to have fallen for my grandads lieswhat is you favourite chocolate
 pardon me boys is that a crunchie in your knapsackif so then gimme gimme gimme it is friday afterall and i do have that feelingyouve got to love the advert from the s although you wont love me in a few hours when you are still singing itthe thing about the advert is when adverts are on the tv we use the time to unwrap chocolates or rearrange our supply of choccy nibbles making sure they are in easy reach when the tv show starts again so when you dont realise the correct context of these words it can be quite alarming swing baby swing the men sing well if you think i will be swapping my chocolate bar with some strange couple you can think again it is quiet a relief to realise they are actually referring to golf now thats not a line i ever thought i would saytypecadbury crunchie milk chocolate with a golden honeycombed centre it is indeed what it says on the wrapper nothing more nothing less for once i can say that i dont believe it has shrunk in size over the years unlike my jeans maybe it has shrunk and ive reached that stage of life where i annoy people with my selective memory no no cant be thati reckon there is just the right amount of chocolate covering on this bar maybe a little more wouldnt go amiss but if cadbury were to reduce the amount then take it from me i will be starting the petition leafleting and tshirt campaigncrunchie is one of those bars that must be eaten at the right temperature ie room temp dont mess with storage temperature with these bars or the honeycomb stops crunching and starts breaking fillings or even worsebecomes chewy buy the crunchie fresh choose your chocolate shop wisely the shops needs to have a fast turnover of confectionary if the shop is located near a school and the shelves are emptied each lunch break then you are onto a winner dont be afraid to request an inspection of the shops storage facilities you cant take it for granted that they have blacked out all sunlight and adjusted the airconcrunchie is a nice alternative to a simple bar of chocolate you might not realise you are in the mood for honeycombuntil you take the first bite the bar will be gone in seconds trust methank crunchie its friday ive got that crunchie feeling im frisky as a lambcruchie is by far the best chocolate bar everi love choclate but this is  of the besthi i would like to know where in south africacape town i can buy the white chocolate crunchieomg i love crunches i love ur description of them i agree sooooo much u r so awesome to write that 
the one thing this does have in common with every other flake ive tried is that its crumbly very crumblyinterestingly the flake tag line the crumbliest flakiest milk chocolate in the world has been changed to the crumbliest flakiest dark chocolate which leads me to believe that somewhere in the world there may be a chocolate even crumblier i intend to make it my lifes work to track this mystery chocolate downer where was i oh yesi have tried this and love it to help with the crumbling i tend to keep the wrapper under the flake whilst eating it this does not solve the whole problem but it helps a little i agree that this dark chocolate isnt exactly luxurious but more of a smooth taste on the tongue and i prefer this to the praline also
galaxy minstrels are another of my childhood favourites that i havent had in years of course back in my day they were just minstrels sans galaxyunusually these are even better than i remember them as a kid im not sure if its just my imagination but they seem bigger  and the galaxy chocolate is certainly creamieroh and they do look quite nice when served in a large wine glasswhile i like galaxy chocolate its not normally my favourite  simply because it is so sweet  but the size of minstrels makes all the difference you get just the right amount of chocolatey creaminess and crispy shell in each onedefinitely a thumbs up but go buy your own okthey remind me of a chocolate we had here in new zealand when i was a child  i just cannot recall the name  i will probably be thinking about it for days nowmmmmmmmm minstrels r amasin they r sooooooooooo gooooooooood i would like to find out from yourselves if this is true please can you tell me if galaxy minstrels have animal rennet in it as it has come across on bbc news your reply would be greatly appreciated thankyoucertainly the ministrels were creamier and dairier than any chocolate you would have ever tasted it was the kind of chocolate which was addictive yet each packet was more than satisfying for ones appetite i truly miss galaxy it is nowhere to be found in north america well it might bei dont think minstrels have rennet in it i am pretty certain of that even though rennet contains the enzymes that help solidify the milk the ingredients are as followssugar cocoa butter skimmed milk powder cocoa mass vegetable vat lactose milk fat e soya dextritin starch glazing agent e colors e e e e vegetable oilwow nicee but i dont think theyre sold here in malaysia i love ministrels too d you described them exactly the way i feel about them ahhhhh craving for some now d d dyummie in the tummiewhat where the milk and white mixed minstrels called vice vercers but were made by cadburys i thinkdo glaxy make anything that is white chocohi could any tell me where can i get it in malaysia else then airports pls tq i got to get it for my girlfriend coming bday plsthanks a bunch
as you may already know im a huge fan of ritter sport they make simple great quality chocolate in decent sized bars its unpretentious and deliciousyes i know this big square of chocolate doesnt look much like a sea shell but look beyond the shape and youll see theyre both good quality chocolates with a soft praline fillingso how does this compare well the chocolate itself is very nice although its not quite as creamy as the guylian thats partly because the guylian shells have white chocolate in them but i think the overall quality is slightly better too but then you expect belgian chocolate to be the best anywaythe ritters filling is slightly softer slightly creamier and slightly nuttier there isnt an awful lot in it but i think the ritter wins here if theres one thing ritter sport is good at its making delicious fillings for their bars this is no exceptionappearance wise i prefer the square slab of chocolate to the fancy sea shell shapes i like chocolate i can eat on the bus without looking like a total idiot and shells are for girlsoverall its close but ritter is much more of an every day chocolate if youre buying chocolate as a gift the guylian is sure to go down better but if you just want a tasty good quality bar go for the rittermakes the best hot chocolate   cups of whole milk to one bar  just heat up the milk drop in the chocolate squares and mix  so simple  so goodthanks rembrandt i will be trying a ritter sport hot chocolate ive used nutella before but i think yours will taste betterha the ritter sport noisette would also work great review chocablog
this small box of guylian seashells is g and contains six guylian belgian chocolates with soft praline centresthe chocolate is a marbled mixture of milk and white chocolate its creamy velvety and delicious the centres are creamy and soft with a slight nutty taste but they dont overpower the chocolate flavourthe overall effect is a rather delicious creamy belgian chocolate that said theyre still not really the kind of chocolates i would buy for myself theyre the kind of chocolate you give as a gift rather than eat every day in fact i think ive only ever had these at christmas and even then theyre usually someone elses that ive er borrowedi get gifts of these chocolates very often they are niceive only ever seen these in weird stores here in the us stores which do not specialize in selling food but instead sell discount things  mostly clothes and things to decorate the house they usually have a gourmet food section but im always afraid that this stuff is like  years oldon another topic i want to be eastcoastlife who gets gifts of chocolate yurmm nobody loves mecan u tell me the praline percentage in thesechocgal i dont think they tell you the percentage of praline  and as i ate these a long time ago i cant check the box for you  sorryoh right thanks anywaysthey do on the big bar but i cant get hold of the chocolates d thanks anyways ddi too have had these as a gift and although delicious they are far too creamy for me being a dark choc fanatic in fact they are so creamy that after say four or five i end up sharing them a lot with my friends and family which is almost unheard of when i have dark chocciesi cant believe you said youd prefer to eat some cheap chocolate bar instead of these exquisite sea shell creations when satisfying your sweet tooth just because theyre molded in a beautiful sea shell shape does not mean it is only acceptable to buy these as a gift i am a chocolate connoisseur and i would much rather spend my money on these than some cheap chocolate bari can agree tracythey are very deliciousand there appears a bar form of the same see shell mixturei saw in their siteshould be less pricey
nothing says christmas quite like a terrys chocolate orange stuffed into your stocking well not if youre my dad at least either me or my sister have bought him one every year since about  it started off as a serious gift but now its more of a joke my dad hates chocolate orangesif youve never had one before terrys chocolate orange is a g ball of solid chocolate flavoured with orange oil and divided into segments the segments are attached to each other in the centre and traditionally you tap it on the table to separate themthe chocolate itself is actually quite nice although at  cocoa solids its not what id call dark the chocolate is quite glossy in appearance and the orange flavour is quite subtle and not too overpoweringthe chocolate orange does have a slightly artificial quality to it but i cant quite put my finger on why i think its a combination of the low cocoa content and the glossy texture but it probably also has something to do with having given them away as joke christmas gifts for most of my lifestill i likecan anyone tell me where i can buy these dark choc oranges in the us google has not found me a sellerim not sure about the us but here in canada we can get them at london drugs or safeway grocery store  hopefully you can find a similar store in your areawe can get them here in nz  i agree with the slightly artificial comment  but love them anywaywhere can i buy them in nz i need about  please helpcan you buy it in france  i would like to taste it ive seen chocolate and raspberry oranges also  which weirded me out but was quite goodin the us you can get their chocolates at world marketi have purchased these dark chocolate oranges every year here in the us for the past  years or so now this year i can not find them anywhere why are they no longer available and where can i purchase them from online i am a very upset customer because these are no longer for purchase in the united states this was a tradition for me every year to purchase these at christmas time now i can no longer pursue my tradition there were dark chocolate orange and raspberry and milk chocolate orange and raspberry i am desperatei have not seen the terrys chocolate oranges yet this year but ralphs groceries in southern california has the light  dark chocolate oranges that at first glance appear to be terrys  same packaging same colors  the brand is ps ralphs store brand  i bought one but have not tried it yet  the ingredients looked goodamazon has themhttpwwwamazoncomterryschocolateorangeounceboxesdpbxqyrefsrieutfmatvpdkikxdersgroceryqidsrdo these count towards your five a day nothing better than a terrys chocolate orange and a bottle of valpolicella wine and cheese maybe but wine and dark orange chocolate booyanow if we could only revive the mandarin orange dark chocolate turtlestry walgreens they have them in north texas usually not too much of an inventoryanuta try your local supermarket  although this dark chocolate version is harder to find than the milk chocolate onewhere can i buy these in nz i need  of them please helpwere is that chocolate in the injectionwhere have the dark chocolate orange  it is the best one and i have been looking for one everywhere please as this will make my christmas 
i probably wouldnt go out and buy these myself but i suppose the kids might like the colourpersonally after eating the whole tube im a little worried i my skin may start glowing in the darksome of the most delious candy i have ever tasted
after eights are thin after dinner chocolates with a mint flavour fondant centre each mint comes in a little black waxpaper envelope to make it look a bit more posh and presumably to stop the chocolate melting and making the whole lot stick togetherbut as after dinner mints go theyre not bad theyre quite refreshing and minty  although the peppermint flavour does somewhat overwhelm any chocolateynesstheyre just not posh chocs any more im quite sure that in this day and age nobody would serve after eights at a serious dinner party any more than theyd serve ferrero rocher to an ambassadorluckily im not planning any dinner parties so i can quite happily scoff the whole box in private without fear of ruining my social statushave you tried the new after eight sticks they taste good if you like after eights but the design has a serious flaw once youve opened them most people will try to pick them up from the top of the tube which then generally falls away from the bottom scattering them all over the placethose who eat afterdinner mints late at night should not be surprised if they wake up after eightcant decide if i like it or notwhat do people think would you think this was a good party theme or not    wow i stocked up on ater eights and fererro rocher at my costco for my christmas party no ambassadors there so no worries ive been thinking about why they are called after eight through logical reasoning and experimentation ive discovered that after eight of them youve had enough
christmas is traditionally a time of year for giving chocolate and more importantly eating it so when a large shoe box packed full of chocolate arrived from the chocstress my first thought was best present ever followed swiftly by oh god im going to have to review all thisto be honest i dont often buy maltesers theyre always there in the shop but they always seem just a little bit dull compared to the vast array of new and exciting chocolates on offerbut when presented with a box this big you cant fail to be impressed theres just so much if you ask me all chocolate should come in this size box as standardand having managed to scoff my way through the majority of the box single handedly i found i quite like them theyre chocolately malty and crunchy just the way they should beand now im exceedingly fathi there would you please review twix one of my favourite thanksi love chocolates and you have so many here some of them i have not seen in singaporeholy cow my father buys it by the buckets at the dutyfree airport whenever he comes back from overseas too bad this happens only once a yearexactly those hersheys whoppers are awefull i live in la rightnow im from the netherlands i miss my maltesers is there any chance i can find them in the us i tried those whoppers immediatly but they are terriblehi im a big maltesers fan actulaly im sating them as i type yum yum keep making them make the biggest box in the worldmaltesers real chocolate ehe e e e eforget chemicals they are brill try living on the edge for once rob get real ladhey there is was wondering where i could buy this because my friend is obsessed with them and what would be the cost thx so much
finding this bar was something of a dja vu experience for me as i had bought a dark chocolate and raspberry bar in sweden this spring and had been unable to find it in the uk that was made by marabou manufacturers of dime  or daim and i suspect that marabou and cte dor may actually be owned by the same companyanyway enough about my international piggery  what about the choccysuffice to say that having tasted this bar in sweden all that time ago i was rather pleased to find cote dor framboise on sale in tesco of all places i immediately snapped up two bars and went home like a kid with a new toy to present them to my wife who is also partial to the occasional nibble of a chocolate barso what does the packet blurb promisenoir framboise smooth  cocoa dark chocolate complimented with a thin layer of raspberries enveloped in chocolateit then goes on to state that by expertly sourcing cocoa beans from west africa and noble beans from south america cote dor delivers an intense full bodied chocolate with rich indulgent flavours seductive aromas and smooth refined textures to provide a uniquely mysterious and exotic tastenow im the sort of person who wouldnt normally think fruit and chocolate  yum show me a chocolate orange or anything strawberry flavoured and ill almost certainly politely decline but the fact that this bar uses real fruit and not oils or artificial flavourings made me think that it was definitely worth trying and i was rightwell i wouldnt go so far as to say it tasted mysterious and exotic but it certainly is intense and full bodied to my mind dark chocolate should be  cocoa or more in order for it to deliver that dark bittersweet cocoa flavour and this one does just that but once the chocolate starts to melt you encounter the waferthin layer of candied raspberry which cuts through the chocolate providing a unique hit of fruit flavour the choice of raspberry was inspired possibly the only fruit that would sit so well with the dark chocolate  not too sweet and definitely not overpowering this bar is a shining example of a well thought out and well made productwell done the belgians a top buy
christmas a time for giving if youre reading this youd probably agree that its a time for giving chocolate and a great opportunity to splash out a bitas you can see from the first photo this is a single estate bar the beans were all grown in ecuador on the hacienda iaraa  dark chocolate bar with pink peppercorns and peri peri chillinot to everyones tastes im sure and certainly not something youd wolf down while watching xmas tellyurther evidence of poshness came when the bar was unwrapped it is just that  a bar no lines no creases nothing but a neatly inscribed hotel chcoclat logo a look at the other side was a bit of a surprise  they certainly werent joking about the pink peppercorns the whole back side of the bar is studded with the little fellersi bet youre now wondering what on earth this thing tasted of well i decide that the best approach was to get the chocolate melted and moving around my palate as quick as possible so a small chunk was placed choccy side down on my tongue and allowed to meltthe chocolate itself is wonderful stuff it melts quickly and delivers a rich bittersweet taste the way a good chocolate ought to then the peppercorns and chilli kick in especially if you start nibbling the peppercorns to finish the taste sensation with their heat and bitterness lovely stuffso whats the overall verdict i wouldnt buy this for just anyone whilst the chocolate itself is of the highest quality and absolutely delicious the chilli and peppercorns put it in the realm of the slightly odd although as we know the aztecs were doing this sort of thing centuries ago this is a bar for delicate nibbling not scarfing down in a few mouthfuls it tastes fantastic  provided you like a little fire in your chocolatei daresay the price makes it a special treat as well i wouldnt know it was a present and as such youd have to pick your recipient carefully or gauge your dinner guests tastes pretty well certainly worth trying and definitely a classy number recommendedcomments are closed
so i didnt take a lot of persuasion to buy these when i saw them on the supermarket shelf in fact the box actively jumped into my shopping basket without any human intervention honest kinder chocolate demands to be eatenthis g box contains  small individually wrapped bars each bar consists of delicious kinder chocolate with a soft white milk chocolate fillingas is usually the case with kinder the chocolate itself is quite thin  but it more than makes up for that in taste its smooth and creamy and simply delicious the white chocolate filling is even creamier and even delicouser yes thats a wordthe only slight disappointment with this is that you dont get quite as much as it might seem from the size of the box each bar is divided into chunks with rather too much space between them that said at p its still fairly good value and the  mini bars lasted more than a day  something of a rarity in my houselove your website but more love to those cute chocasyummy these are real fast to finish by the boxes love kinder bueno so creamy inside but shit websitei love youlol yeah i used to finish everything in less than one hour ogh i love these mmmthe chocolate is good but it is about the toy the chocolate compliments the toys the toy is supreme superior all other toys besides kinder are inferiori looooooveeeed your web siteand chocolate kindeeer i love this chocolate but it just seams to disapear its so addicting and my friends love it and i need to hide it from them and myself at timesi do not understand why any company will put such trash as a gift for young children dont they realise that little pieces of toys like that are a hazzard and dangerousi love kinder surprise chocolate its far more superior then nestle or cadbury the only annoying this is why they dont sell it as a big gm block i have bought the gm but the individually wrapped bars are always gone by end of day why dont they make large rectangular sizes for adultsmy friend introduced kinder bueno to me when we had a slumber party at my cribthe first time i took a bit of it i was so eager to take another bite but unfortunately she was munching on it and finished it by herself the next morning we rushed in the grocery and bought  packs of it i suuuupeeeerrr love iti love kinder surprise great  chocolate
green  blacks caramel bar is in a class above most of its competitors thoughopening the thick paper wrapper reveals a second gold foil wrapper inside which only serves to increase the expectancy of the chocolate insidewhen you do finally get down to the chocolate youre not disappointed either its obvious a lot of attention has gone into the look of the bar  from the design of the chunks right down the piece of card the chocolate sits on to stop it breaking before you get it homebut the really interesting thing about this bar is the taste it contains both sea salt and alcohol and you can taste both the wrapper claims the sea salt helps cut through the sweetness of the caramel and i would have to agree some caramel bars just taste sickly sweet but this has real depthi tried this one a couple of months ago it wasnt bad but it just didnt thrill me enough to even finish it let alone write up a review i did like the salty kick as a change from the caramello barglad i found this review i saw it and then passed it up i love just about anything caramelwow i just went onto this site to see what it was about and there featured was the queen of all chocolate caramel bars  after having bought a box of these quite heftilypriced but wellworththemoney chocolate bars in anticipation of using them in various recipes which called for both chocolate and caramel i would buy them again the sea salt lends a surprise and cuts through the sweet taste yet i wonder if green  blacks would ever consider making this bar with dark rather than milk chocolatei had some green  blacks dark chocolate about  years ago i felt that it was very nicely packaged and they had obviously invested in marketing but the actual chocolate quality did not match the price maybe it was just their dark chocolate or perhaps they have improvedall i can say is aarrrgghh mmmm c h o c h o l a t e gooeyi havent had one of these for so long dont even know if i can get these in canadadisaster  i went to watrose budgens and planet organic in london and all of them have an evil imposter posing as caramel with the same yellow strip across the top but actually sporting the label butterscotch or something instead  i bought it once as i was fooled by the label and was disappointed the butterscotch is gross  but now they seem to have actually stopped selling the caramel and started just loading up all the caramel slots with the disgusting butterscotch as if they are trying to trick people into buying it because they think its caramelhas it been taken off because they discovered green  blacks were putting plutonium in it or somethingif theres no good reason for this and i find the partys responsiblei am booking a therapist right now i cant believe there is no more green  blacks caramel in the worlddear all who are in morning for green  blacks caramel  i have had confirmation from gbs that they are no longer making it  not selling enough they said but what i still havent had an answer to is why it was hardly ever available most of the bigger supermarket chains sold ever flavour but caramel  i had to hunt around to the odd local store that would get it in i warned the owners of gbs that they were making a huge mistake selling out to cadburys yes for anyone who didnt know they have owned gbs for a while now  blah please join me in writing to gbs go to their website and email them to complain about no caramel  we dont want the imposter butterscotch in the caramel wrapping  what a cheek theyve goti found this blog because i was bemoaning the fact that you cant get this fabulous bar in the shops anymore bizarrely though you can buy it as a limited edition bar direct from green  blacks website what are they playing at come on gb  get this back in the shops nowhttpwwwgreenandblacksdirectcomjust to let people know gb have started selling caramel again on their websitehttpwwwgreenandblacksdirectcompageschocolatebarcollectiondefaultaspxyou are dealing with the devil youre  screwed
what is cadbury highlightssmooth milk chocolate with no added sugaryes you read that right this is chocolate with no added sugarexcessive consumption may produce laxative effectgastric distress eeepluckily i only have a small bar of this to try out and im willing to take a risk for chocablogbut the taste is definitely different the flavour is similar to the kind of cheap chocolate you get in nobrand easter eggs artificial slightly plasticy chocolatebutnotquitechocolateits not an offensive taste but its certainly not as nice as dairy milk i happily ate the whole thing but i dont think i would have wanted a bigger bar the whole gastric distress thing put me off a bit anywayi tried this last night  i also picked up the tesco own brand version  to my surprise the tesco version has a taste of belgian chocolate about it  cadbury version  calories g fat g weight miserly  tesco version  calories ouch g fat fairly low g weight  choices choicesoh hang on  i just looked at a regular dairy milk  calories  but fat   lower than the tesco bar  confusingcan you please let me know when i can purchase cabury highlights tescos have stopped stocking this item in aylesburythankshi did you find out where to buy the highlights no added sugar chocolate as i would like to buy some pleasemichael given how big tesco in aylesbury is i would think its quite likely its been discontinued if you cant find it therehi im  not english  so i hope you would take that into concideration when i make some spelling and grammar mistakes i apologize for my english i love chocolate i came across this blog by accident and i thought  now thats something i love i saw the post about sweet truffels and i do belive they are unbelivably unike i also once had somthing similar but instead of vodka the truffels were filled with greek ouzo the hart of the truffel was so soft and tender they were fantastic on the outside the truffels were covered with powdered bitter  cocoai really like this highlights bar o i only have a couple of chunks at a time anyway so the laxative effect probaby wont be an issue and i expect youd have to eat several bars to experience any gastric distress its yummy tastes like cadburys choc should do  didnt find it plasticy or artificial at all o noguiltchoccy fab
i was in edinburgh  in woolies of all places  when these intriguing little chocolate straws waved to me from the shelf i thought theyd make an interesting gift for my wife who is also partial to the odd bit of chocolate now and then so i grabbed a tube the next week or so was an exercise in self control there they were every time i opened my case teasing meso what do you get obviously an interesting package definitely going for the upmarket look however a quick read of he label and alarm bells start ringingingredients  plain chocolatewhen the packet was opened a twist of the base and the upper part slides off the straws present themselves in a neat fan very attractive somebody has obviously thought this through imagine mine hostess delivering them to the centre of the table after dinner very sophisticatednow comes the crucial part  how do they taste well to be perfectly honest theyre very average the chocolate feels as though its cheap it has that grainy texture one often finds with lowcocoa plain chocolate and the filling is overly sweet for my palate at leastfar from being the sophisticated well made rich tasting treats id expected they came across as being more like kid sweets  overly sugared made from cheap ingredients and ultimately disappointingwell thats dissapointing given the package presentation i also would have expected something finer more gourmet down with cheap chocolatethe body also gets some important antioxidants from these powerful fruits
theyre squarer and less pronounced than the dairy milk with creme egg variety i doubt this affects the taste but it does make it more difficult to break the chunks off making them more of a bite it than a break it eating experienceboth bars taste pretty much how youd expect the orange variety tastes of chocolate orange and the mint variety tastes just like any other mint flavoured chocolateafter several minutes of experimentation i found the best way to eat these is to bite off a chunk and let it slowly melt in your mouth if you chew they have a slightly gritty texture but allowing it to melt away releases the flavour slowly mmmmfor dairy milk addicts these are a great little addition to the range giving you the full cadbury experience with a twistcomments are closed
time out has been around since  but i dont think ive ever been tempted by it before so i didnt really know what to expectmore precisely its two thin bars consisting of a very thin layer of folded chocolate reminiscent of twirl or flake sandwiched between two equally thin wafers and covered in an even thinner layer of milk chocolateso its thin thenim guessing this is aimed at the busy working woman who doesnt want to get fat by eating a heavy chocolate bar but just wants a quick snack between typing up reports for her evil slave driving misogynistic boss but thats just a guess and im often wrong about these thingsneedless to say i wasnt entirely satisfied by time out but i didnt really want more either although it was nice enough i just found myself wanting something a little more substantialim also slightly peeved at the profusion of similar bars on the market at the moment im getting a little bored of the old two fingers of milk chocolate with some wafer formulathere yooo i rate the flake in the middle i find that if you eat them in the bath you get a rush of blood to the headme love time out pit taste like coffee but i luv it xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxi personally really enjoy these it has less biscuit than a kitkat which i think it was designed to compete with at break times so its more chocolatey and yet much more exciting than a flake or twirl because of the crispy factori  time outps im not sad enough to be writing that at  am  i live in melbourne and yes im at workthose chocolate eggs are my dnfwoall i must get them out of my househow have i never heard that song before i thought i knew every s song ever written good music does make a workout so much bettergood luck this week and thanks for your sweet commentsxoxojen
i was slightly at a loss when trying to come up with an angle for this cadbury caramel review so i decided to ask pewari for her opinion and sent an instant message a few seconds later a flurry of messages arrived backso there you have it cadbury dairy milk with caramel reviewed in full thank you for readingcadburys caramel as it used to be known is another of my childhood favourites but i always saw this as a little more of a treat than the standard mars bar or milky way i think that was partly down to the advertisingi cant quite put my finger on why i was so tempted by a sexy bunny with gooey chocolate as a young teenage boy oh wait a minuteahemsadly these ads disappeared in the s and caramel became part of the dairy milk superbrand in  this policy of branding just about all their chocolate bars as dairy milk with something just doesnt have the same appeal and means theres little room for advertising the individual dairy milk varieties so i doubt cute gooey bunny girl will be returning any time soonahhh the cute and fluffy caramel bunny  voiced by miriam margolyes  who while certainly cute and fluffy in her own delectable way doesnt always put me in mind of the cahdbayrees cahrahmael bunnyhey does anyone know where i can buy cadburys chocolate and caramel fingers online from the uki love those karemello koalas too id loive to see a reviewi love that bunny on the old advert i would shag the filthy bunnyandy likes to lick cadbury creme eggs out andrew robertsonthats the best chocolate ive ever tried i bought it when i went to london but it isnt for sale in spain not even in gibraltar they got another dairy ones what a pittywrong the caramel bunny with slightly different looks returned  years after you posted this why dont you try reveiwing the uk version of cadbury dairy milk caramello nextcadbury eggs lying around the house but if we do were deentiifly using them to make this milkshake from spiced thanks easter bunny pick up a new blender while youre at
i came across this little beauty while browsing for belgian choccy in sainsburys a while back intrigued by the concept and in the interests of all chocablog readers i took a leap of faith and bagged a barthe packaging certainly looked the part  the slimboxaswrapper discreet gold foiling well photographed squares of chocolate teasing the potential buyer with a saucy flash of their creamy interior who could resist not me at any rate my inner fat bloke was definitely up for sampling this oneonly one way to find out kidslike our common hero little charlie bucket i like to have a smell of a freshly opened bar of chocolate it gives one a pretty good idea of whats in store so i split the seal slid out the surprisingly thick slab of choccy ran a nail along the first horizontal seam and cracked the barnow theres a good reason for my liking of posh chocolate its generally very well made and as a rule it does what it says on the wrapperboxtin well my friends this was no exception first sniff said choccy cream and caramel and so it was to beeach square contained a lovely soft rich creamy layer of crme brle which in turn contained little chips of the caramelised topping one would expect the thing was these bits werent like the nougaty bits in a toblerone destined to clump together and find the nearest dental recess or cavity to adhere to nono these were wisps of flavour adding that slight extra bittersweetness to the flavour without overpowering it the milk chocolate is a lovely fullflavoured blend and theres enough there to remind you youre eating a choccy bar first and foremostas you may have gathered i thoroughly enjoyed this one and managed to keep the bar alive for a good few days before i revealed it to my wifemy only disappointment has been that to date i havent seen any more on sale please dont tell me it was a limited editiondelicioussssssssssssoh my godi came over from poppys because once the idea of creme brulee chocolates had entered my mind i could think of nothing else wow droolingman i know and eat these since years in france and believe me they are not discontinued you can still buy em at least in france you have to try the other ones especially the lemon pie its just fantastici bought a bar of this tonight and it was absolutely wonderful they still sell them because i bought one at walmart suprise huhi must be lucky then as here in finland they sell these bars and the lemon pie ones eg in a big supermarket chain the price is a bit on the nasty side but the chocolate is heavenly even considering its lindtomg best chocolates ver dont worry they still sell them ive bought them in el corte ingles in spain galleries lafayette in france supermarkets in ch and walgreens in the states i hate they dont have them in mexico yeti agree this bar has heavenly taste i bought it at target us and paid about  dollars it was thicker than i expected so much creamier sweet and perfectly enjoyable bar it is one of my favorite milk chocolate bars ive ever tasted and i liked the tramisu one as well i just bought this bar on the weekend  i also bought the lemon tart one  it is so yummy  i got it at the fashion outlets lindt store in niagara falls  i regret just buying one of each bari am from canada and fell in love with this bar whilst traveling through france in   for some time i was able to get them here during the christmas season when lindt suppliers here typically carry a wider selection of products  naturally i stocked up for what i thought id consume throughout the year  i got a nasty surprise when i when to canadian lindt supplier in december  and they informed me its been discontinued  interestingly enough on a trip to the us earlier this year i found them in a lindt store  apparently it depends on what country youre in as to whether or not its availablethis is outstanding delicious magnificent lindt is the best g can be eaten for a few seconds does anyone know where i can find these bars in germany i looked on the lindt website and could not order do they have them discontinued love this lindt product best one in my opinion the crunchy carmalized sugar in the filling is amazing and it doesnt get stuck to your teeth
heres another variation on the chocolate  caramel theme that seems to be popular these daysaero caramel consists of layer of bubbly aero chocolate topped with a layer of caramel and all wrapped in smooth milk chocolate the top of the bar gives the impression it can be divided into chunks but the dividing lines and aero logos are really just there for showthe bubbles are much smaller than they are in a normal aero  almost the same consistency as the old cadbury wispa i think i actually prefer this as it gives the impression of lighter whipped texture without feeling youve been cheated into buying something thats mainly fresh air makes a nice change from solid chocolatehaving said that the chocolate here is decidedly average its not offensive by any means but its certainly nothing special eitheri didnt even bother with the instant win promotion annoyingly the web site wants all kinds of personal information before it will let enter the promotional codeyes normally i like aero varieties but his caramel version is a touch too sickly for me and v messy with the runny filling id eat it if it was given to me but i probably wouldnt buy one for myselfi thought i had seen aero filled chocolate rabbits advertised on television  is this correct and if so where can i buy them   i live in tn ll  thank you
actually thats not entirely true  im an experienced chocolate eater and knew exactly where to put this but the fact remains its still a marvel of chocolateering and the rather plain foil wrapper doesnt do justice to whats insideguylian dark orange is divided into four large chunks each of which has the guylian trademark sea shell related design embossed on it the bar is generously filled with a tangy orange cremeive always loved the look of guylian chocolates the surface is dark and glossy with the shells themselves having a white chocolate effect the designs are intricate and almost look as though theyve been carved out of some chocolatey marblethe filling is deliciously tangy and orangey and theres lots of it ive always loved soft centres and this is just like the orange cremes in an expensive box of chocolates in a convenient baroverall this is g of chocolate heaven not that youd know it from the wrapperim trying to get my hands on this one and was wondering if you can remember how much it costs
so my reaction on finding this new addition to the range was mixture of excitement and trepidation it sounds delicious but could it possibly live up to the standards set by its siblingsi neednt have worriedritter sport chocolate crme is another g square of delicious milk chocolate divided into chunks each chunk is filled with a thick cocoa cremejust like the cappuccino variety the first thing you notice when you open this is the aroma or smell as we common folk say it smells like a delicious hot chocolate and it screams eat me now not literally obviously although i think the whole talking chocolate idea has distinct possibilitiesthe chocolate creme is thicker than i had expected but it tastes wonderful for some reason it took me back to my childhood but i cant put my finger on exactly why as far as im away i wasnt attacked by a chocolate monster when i was a childlooking at the ingredients the filling appears to be made of a hazelnut paste although i cant really detect any nuttiness it has that comforting hot chocolate taste and  melts in the mouth satisfyingly perfect comfort food for cold winter nightsgo get somemmmm this sound sumptuous i love ritter too but not that many shops sell it around my way our local tesco sells the marzipan bar but nothing elselovewendysadly it looks like ritter sport stopped making this particular variety  this cocoa creme bar was the best chocolate on the planet imo  ive been searching for it for over a year without luck and now i know whyby the way the back to your childhood for some reason thing is that there was some kind of candy or ice cream that i havent tasted since the s and sadly i cant remember what it was either
whatever you call it this bar is quite simple a white chocolate flake dipped in milk chocolatefor me the most interesting thing about this is that cadbury dont often do white chocolate in fact the only other products i can think of offhand are dream bar and white chocolate buttonsthe white chocolate is very sweet but thats slightly offset by the thick milk chocolate coating apart from that the taste is nothing to write home about but its the texture that makes it stand out the flakes of white chocolate melt away in the mouth and all too quickly you wonder where your snowflake wentoverall this is vastly superior to flake praline but i still cant see myself buying it regularly maybe as a treat for those days where i cant decide between white or milk chocolatei love snow flakes i remember trying one when they first came out and they were actually called snow flake and got hooked on the first bite fantastic blog keep the chocolate comingmmmm in new zealand we have the new mint flake its so goodthe snowflake is the most amazing chocolate ever  i keep them in the freezer which keeps them fresh longer and also makes it fantastically crumbly when eating  when one takes a bit it first crubles and as it heats up in your mouth it gets sweeter and finally it almost takes like hot chocolate just as your swallowing it  i love these things and eat one half of one if i can control myself with black coffee every morning  it is a lovely way to start the day  problem is they are very very very hard to find problem is they are very very very hard to findcan they be found at all any morei cant seem to find them either and i do wish they would make more because the milk chocolate goes so well with the white chocolate it almost tastes like kinder egg chocolate and that is the best combination  i have searched everywhere and the only one i can find is the originalgutted can they be found at all any moreit must be a good few years now since i last had one im suprised at how recent the date on the original blog post iswhy do they always seem to discontinue the best products  i just dont understand and without warning too  first wispa just disappeared and now snowflake  theyre bringing wispa back soon though yeywhy do they always seem to discontinue the best products i just dont understand and without warning too first wispa just disappeared and now snowflake theyre bringing wispa back soon though yeysnow flakes are or were the best they were lovely can you still buy them are they just very very very very very hard to find or have they been discontinuedi believe that they have actually been discontinued i have contacted cadbury just to ask if they will be relaunching them  i know sad but heyif we all get in contact with cadbury they may bring it back it worked with wispai recon we should tell cadburys to relaunchi have also contacted cadburys i wud buy at least a case a wk of them am a snowflake freakany response from cadburys yet  i would  for them to bring them back i can buy them in covent garden in the aussie shop in london but they should be relaunched d i agree they discontinue all of the great stuff wispas snowflakes what will be nextomg can you buy them in covent garden thats sly im seaham county durham north east london is a million miles away lol but  im going to london in febuary  gonna buy  full crates of them lolhidoes anyone know if the aussie shop still stocks snowflakes or if there is any place in london that you can buy themthanksellehi asre you still looking for snow flake there some here in bundaberg australia in colesyou can find them at the local british shopscould you please tell me where can i buy a snowflake from in the uk if not within the uk i dont mind buiying it outside of uk many thankswe get these chocolates in south africa ive had at least  in the last week lolbut how does one from uk get hold of them   please helpinstruct oh and btw are they good quality and not some cheap version very importanti dont think they makesell them in the uk any moreoh ok ty for letting me know any chance of knowing where else i could get my hands on themi cannot find them in the shops in midhertsi emailed cadbury asking if theyll be bringing these back and they said although this product has been discontinued we do listen to consumers comments so there is a chance you may see it again in the future so in other words everyone email them asking them to bring them back d the more demand there is for it the more chance of them bringing it backmust depend on where you are as theyve not been discontinued here i still see them for sale in the shop down from where i livechm where do you live  if you tell me the area i can pop down and pick some up  i have  a  bet going on with a frienddo any of you have any recipes fro creating this candy
the wrapper describes this as crumbly milk chocolate flake nestled in a rich hazelnut praline i beg to differi would describe it as cadbury flake half dragged through a shallow bath of chocolate that happened to have some bits of nondescript nut in it but i guess that wouldnt have looked quite so appealing on the labeltexture wise this is pretty much like a normal flake  meaning it crumbled all over my keyboard upon biting into it the only real difference is the small pieces of nut which give the bar a slightly gritty feelthe taste is pleasant enough  the overall effect being just like a normal flake with a hint of nuttiness but im not convinced its different enough  to make it worthwhile unless youre an absolute hazelnut nutnice enough but i prefer the originali like dipped flakes snowflake isnt bad but praline is just wrongregardsrobmmmm i love praline flakes theyre rather messy but delicious best eaten when alone holaquiero decirles que hoy recibi tres barras de chocolate flake y me parecieron de lo mas delicioso nunca habia probado algo tan delicioso en chocolate como estos aca en chihuahua mexico los trajeros segun me dicen desde inglaterra y lo agradezco aun masi have been trying to buy the flakes praline cant find them anywhere  any tips
well it has to be said mixed berry crunch white chocolate lolly truffle and i got on quite well although i do wish it had a catchier name the artificial flavourings are quite obvious leaving you with a hint of chemical aftertaste there are a few fruit pieces but i didnt notice any flavour actually coming from them they were just chewythe crisp cereal and crunchy shortcake biscuits are so few as to be almost incidentalunlike cookies  cream belgian milk chocolate lolly truffle the chocolate shell works well with this lolly there is a good thick coating of smooth white chocolate and the sweetness of it compliments the tangy filling if you are in the mood for a good ol sugar fix then this will be for youleaves you buzzing for hoursnow that one looks nice ill take two pleasethat looks so yummy  thank you so much for the postwhat i love most about it is that it looks like an ice cream bar instead of a choc bar it makes me want to have an ice cream later
ah dairy milk where do you start a review on the mother of all chocolateswell how about a little history lesson firstfor the purpose of this review i chose a large duh g bar of unadulterated dairy milk solid milk chocolate heavenone quick point to note  this is not the same as the us version of cadbury dairy milk which is a reformulated version made under license by hersheys i believe this has something to do with fda rules on labeling chocolate that has vegetable fat in place of cocoa butterso whats so special about dairy milk why is it so popularthe chocolate itself is sweet without being sickly its creamy but not so much that you cant taste the chocolate its filling but simultaneously moreish and importantly for a poor blogger its inexpensive without being cheaphaving spent some time considering this ive come to the conclusion that the primary reason for its popularity is simply that its completely inoffensive and totally middle of the roadis that a bad thing i dont think soin one form or another its the chocolate i buy more than any other and i dont plan on giving it uphas anyone tried the new dairymilk double chocyes its very nice and a great addition to the cadburys rangecherylhttpwwwclicksouvenirscomi thought it kinda just tasted like the caramel dairymilk but chocolate caramel lmao oh my god love the newadvert with the gorilla wanna see more off it fantastic marleting campaignei love chhocollate x i eat it its ytummuthis is one of my fave types of chocolate great site by the way dhmmhey can u guys giv me few factors taht draws u towards this yummm chocneed  write a reportplzumm well its moreish makes you want another one straight after for me its not too sicklyits soft depending how you eat itits simple you know what you are gettin and there isnt too many flavours packed it too one barsometime thats a good thingsometimes it isnt hope this helps also you know its going to satisfy those chocolate cravings yumguess what im off to buy nowpcadbury is the one of the most tasty choclate i have eat i love this choclate till my last breathdis is a cool sitee i lurvv chocolate  th core and derry melk is my favee     xx yuma bit bland for me but tasty chocolateits a veeeeryyyyyyyyy nice and useful product review for methaaaanxxxxx alotthis is helping me prepare for my examare you in beaconhouse school what about an expose on the apparent differences between ukireland and au dairy milk cause of big debates between expats in both countriesi put melted chocolate into a condom freeze it and use it as a dildo yummy xxxxx
id already passed the chocolate aisle in the coop when i came across a small display of chocolate standing pitifully alone being a big softie and feeling its my duty to care for any stranded chocolate bar i adopted twotoday i shall be reporting on the cookies and cream lolly truffle the first appeal was the promises cookies and cream yum belgian chocolate yes please lolly okwrapper description  delicious layers of vanilla flavour and milk chocolate truffle with crunchy cocoa biscuits and cocoa nibs in smooth belgian milk chocolatethe first bite is good a well balanced mix of textures and tastes you can taste each and every ingredient and all work well together by the second bite i found myself doubting the milk chocolate covering there is a lot of milk chocolate and so you cant escape it so by the third bite i was wishing i could escape it by the end of the lolly i was still cheering the filling especially the crunchy biscuits it just wouldnt work without these but as for the belgian chocolatei couldnt help but think of that cheap and nasty chocolate kiddies get in advent calendarsthis product would probably work best as a bite size chocolate in a box id be happy having eaten one but would certainly select a different chocolate afterwards to counterbalance the sicklinesswaiting patiently is the mixed berry crunch white chocolate lolly truffle ill let you know how we get on lateryum yum yum
however being somewhat more restrained i managed to limit myself to a single packet rather than her er  packsprior to  mint munchies were known as mintola apparently  ive never had them they look just like regular munchies but consist of dark chocolate with a mint fondant centre  and no crunchie bitjudging by chocstresss review i suspect these are a little better than regular munchies but im still not overly fond of themthe second problem is the fondant is just too thin its almost but not quite liquid because of this its gone almost as soon as you put it into your mouth theres no real satisfaction to eating themwhile mint munchies arent completely offensive theres nothing really to recommend them eitherand i wont be buying another six packs just to check no crunchie it cant be munchieim with cybele on this  what do you mean there is no crunchie in the munchie just wrong i tell yanow then who mentioned a six pack hmmm mint munches appear to have become after eight  when did that happen
i decided to do a little experiment when i bought myself a cadbury double decker i bought three of them and having a little wager with myself that i knew what the response would be i gave a bar to each of two friends of mine both duly responding by announcing ohh i havent had one of these in agesi won the betdouble deckers are one of those bars we kind of ignore them when we choose our chocolate but when it actually occurs to us to buy one we cant understand why we left it so long we binge on them for a couple of weeks and then leave them once again to be ignored on the sweet shop shelfi guess the name is so apt in more ways than one just like the proverbial double decker bus you wait for ages and none appear then numerous ones arrive all at oncethe lower deck of this bar is crispy crunchy cereal and the upper deck is a chewy nougatine all wrapped in milk chocolateits a mighty filling bar and not one you could eat if you are trying to have a conversation at the same time if the phone rings while you have a mouthful of double decker there is little chance that the caller will still be there by the time you have finished chewing a return call usually prompts a friend informing you that they just called a wrong number and heard nothing but muffled yumming noisesthe two things that make this bar so scrummy are  the cereal is indeed very crispy and  the nougatine has the perfect level of chewyness added with the smoothness of the chocolate this bar has it alli wouldnt recommend chilling a double decker it would just become too chewyoh your comment about not chilling it has made me ponder on the idea of what it would be like if slightly heated so that the nougat melts goes softyou are so so so so so so so so cooloooh i sense another deep fried experiment coming onohh i havent had one of these in agesand dom  noi gave in and bought one yesterday but no melting or deep frying took place youll be glad to knowcan you provide the chocolate smell too please i am trying to lose weight and your photos are keeping me going on my chocolate highs but i need that heady perfume toomiss l  the smell of chocolatemmmmm for some reason muffled yumming noises sent me into a fit of helpless giggles i should probably go to bed nowi wonder if theres any chance of a crunchie bar review continues skimming the archivesbut what ever happened to the raisins  shock horroroh my i really havent had one of these in ages yes they removed the rasins in thank yougi was trying to work out why i find these so goddam addictivethen i found out the truththey are flavoured with a hint of coffeei have to disagree with the chilled comment left in the fridge for a couple of hours a double decker becomes a delightful indulgence to be slowly savoureddom  you are the main man

of a double decker well done sirwow just had one of these after reading this forgotten how great they arei agree jo theyre great particularly combined with a coke for full sugar goodness vending

tend to leave i have moved on to kinder buenos and yorkie raisin and biscuit the double deckers just like the moro you leave it after a whilei really cant stand these since they took the raisins outtheyre somehow too sickly now where the raisins used to break up the sweetness a bitcadbury  sort yourselves out and give us our raisins back exdoubledecker loveri dont miss the raisins as i never had a double decker before  but i can sense nowsitting here with one beside methat it would be good with a fewas a yank i first discovered double decker during a studyabroad session in my university days ive missed them ever since but recently found a few import shops that carry them most of the time has cadbury ever sold double decker here as a locally produced item i dont think so buteveryone ive shared a double decker with ends up loving it its just the perfect combinationand no it wouldnt be better frieddid they used to be bigger  i have a colleague who is trying to tell me that they shrunk them for a while but have since returned them to there former glory like they did with monster munch  can anyone confirm of deny this rumour  i need to knowi love double deckers its my favorate choccy bar on the marked  i like to pet them in the freezer and eat them frozen with a hot cuppa lovely well you guys have an interesting lifehi guysbilly your a legendoh man dis is safe init i jus

munch munch that it was divine chomp chompwould anyone agree that its heartless and cruel that amazoncouk wont deliver cadburys overseas i live in japan and cadburys in japan are imported from australia or thereabouts and the fact that they taste totally different leaves me gutless and disheartened my theory is the milk in it this means i dont think ill be able to eat another double decker for a very long time yay  double decker  
the frys chocolate cream was the first chocolate confectionery ever to be made on a factory scale so as such is the granddaddy of all chocolate bars  the tagline is dark chocolate with fondant centre which to be honest ive always considered to be fairly poor and unenticing description  not that i could tell you a better oneon unwrapping you are confronted with a long d shaped bar of dark chocolate about cm long cm wide and just under cm at the thickest part of the d  the word fry appears at intervals separated with an indented line on the surface implying you could break it into chunks but in practice is just decorative  far better just to chomp straight into itbiting into the bar you get a decent mouthful of rich and bitter chocolate  the fondant centre is moist and i swear that its a mint taste not an overpowering one but mint all the same yet according to the ingredients and the product description there is no mint  perhaps a trick played on the mind with the contrasts of bitter and sweetall in all this is still my favourite bitter chocolate by far i wasnt disappointed  one bar is enough though its rich and leaves you feeling like you had a decent chocofix  the second bar does leave you feeling a bit sick well i had to try in the interests of a proper review after all  this is a classic chocolate bar that still holds its own well in a saturated marketbring back frys  fruit centre or tell me where i can get iti too am at a loss as to why the frys five fruits are no longer available i travelled to the uk from australia as part of a culinary excursion on a best of uk foodie trip we have thus far managed to track down deepfried pizza pork scratchings and then like but i am inconsolable at the dearth of frys five fruits ive heard many and varied stories about these fondly nicknamed triple fs and was promised something bordering on a religious experience upon their milky chocolate coat giving way to a deliciously smooth fruity centre ive sought counselling to try to get over this whole in my life which i doubt will ever be filled with any fruity fabulousness let alone five someone get me somei visited a frys exhibition at the castleon a visit to york a few years ago  inundated with free chocolates heavenother than our wonderful haighs chocs the  fruits arewere the bestis there anywhere in the world that still has thembring back the five fruitsthey were covered in dark chocolate not milk chocolateit is worth it thoughwhy not go to covent garden and cybercandy at  garrick street and have a feastwhat is the history of frys coconut from late s early s noone else seems to remenberi too have very fond memories of the delicious frys coconut from the early to mid sixties i remember it as a rather firm and chewy pink possibly raspberry flavoured coconut covered in luscious frys dark chocolatethe whole was wrapped in a smart dark blue wrapper with white writing i too am rather surprised that it is not more widely rememberedi have just finished eating my chocolate fix frys  cream it has to be simply the best chocolate in the world there is nothing to compare with it many years ago i worked with a lady who used to squash a bar of frys cream on her rollugh just been reading the comments and yes what happened to the frys five centre bar i had forgotton about that onethe five centre was just mentioned on our local radio station which brought back happy memories and all of a sudden i want one nowok ok ok we all know there was a five flavour frys chocolate bar but what were the  flavours in it andyi cant have you out there in cyberspace wondering what were the five flavours ive had sleepless nights myself and i dont want to leave any other living soul in something which i can only compare to purgatory from what ive heard so im here to put you out of your unquestionable miserythe five flavours were orange the colour of valencias national fruit mmmm juicy lemon like the morning sun peeking over dewy mountains lime fresh cut grass smells soooo good strawberry pale pink sweet goopiness and raspberry the most exciting flavour of allnow back to workyes indeed bring back this bar it was chocolate heaven they dont make them like this any more  i would love to see this back out they dont make them like this any more please bring this back out out lol but u no they wont cadbury will say its the future now we have to make modern bars but i like to be stuck in  a timewarp when chocolate was chocolate please bring this back cadburyi have just learned that my dear sister who i lost last monday had the same favourite taste in chocolate as me  the wonderful frys five centre  yummy  as children we also loved the orange peppermint  cream but not as much as the milk chocolate five flavours lemon lime orange strawberry  raspberry x   lets get a petition up to cadbury for the return of this much loved chocolate bar  i will write to them immediatelyi love the orange creami remember the  centre bar with a drooling desirenothing quite makes the grade so delicious so lovely  why oh why cant cadburys see the light and bring back the fruity chocolatey gorgeousnessmaybe in we inundate them with requests for the five centre bar they will bring it backfrys five centre as i recall was milk chocolate and the flavours were  x raspberry  x strawberry  x orange  x lime and  x pineapple as opposed to lemonyes cadburys bring it backmarsh in appletoni too have been searching for some time i told my grandson about them and now he wants  too  unfortunately i have just picked up on another blog that the machinery wore out and sales did not warrant replacement machinerythat i cannot believei had one of the orange bars yesterday  yumo  the shop had the peppermint and the vanilla cream as well  now it seems to me that if they have the machinery to make one whole flavour per bar then all they have to do is make all the original flavours in five different bars  you would of course have to buy all five and take a bit out of all of them  problem solved   its called thinking laterallyi love frys  i love frysi am in  adelaide where do i buy themwe have a chocolate nuts and coffee chain here in victoria called nutshack and they sell the three bars peppermint orange and original  i dont know if this store is in other states but thats the only place ive seen them  any supermarket has the turkish delightthank you ms carterthe flavours were definety orange raspberry lemon lime and strawberryplease bring the premier of chocolate backwe all want it more than wispalol xoh my god me and my mum used to love the  fruit cream fry bar i cant believe theyve stopped making it and doogal youre right definately want it more than wispa although they are lush as well does anyone remember poppet fruit creams as well why do they always get ridchange the good stuff raisins in revels anyone yack xi have just eaten a frys peppermint bar chocolate is same as the old frys but i miss the white fondant centre peppermint frys bar was purchased in traralgon victoria imported from uk am going to ask if they can import the white and  flavours will updatecyber candy in covent garden still sell them but they imported from australiai wish cadburys uk made themaccording to wikipedia the  flavour centre is no longer made  i always tasted lemon in the classic fondant though obviously the peppermint version tastes of minti just purchased  frys chocolate cream barsdisgusting is all i can say to describe themwhy were they disgustingdid frys have a mazipan flavour chocolate creamas a vegan its great to know the longest running chocolate bar it was launched in  is cruelty free no cows have to suffer for this delicious delightwhy did they stop making them did they sell the frys businessfrys chocolate cream is still being made if youre on about frys five fruit centres i read above that it was mentioned in a blog that the machinery wore out and sales figures made it nonviable to buy new equipment to continue its production i think if cadburys introduced something even better it would maybe be successful enough perhaps a bar called frys chocolate  cream each segment could have a different flavour fondant centre the original peppermint orange strawberry raspberry lemon and lime are good options it could even be the best selling product in the rangefrys chocolate cream has been my favourite since childhood and you can get it in canada but i tink that they are few and far between of late i have been lusting after the bar that had coffee flavoured cream or to be honest any coffee flavoured chocolateam i hallucinating did frys have the coffee flavoured cream bari just saw on ebay an original tuppeny bar of frys coffee cream that sold for  pounds unbelievable so i guess i have answered my own questionhaha i do remember the original frys chocolate cream being so much larger and covered with a thin silver foil so decadentoh yeh frys  centre  hmmmmm was undoubtedly the best choc bar around was gutted when i couldnt find it anymore xi have been eating frys chocolate cream since i was a child and it never dissapoints  i would like to see more of the mint and orange cream on the shelves of supermarkets and more importantly they used to do a fruit cream  each segament could be either orange pink or lime green  would be great to see that back in circulation again  the chocolate is still excellent slightly spicy and i would highly recommend to all those virgin frys eatersi too love frys chocolate creams i neevr got to try the  fruits discontinued in  the size of the bar was originally smaller but was increased sometime in the s or s and has stayed the same since they still use the original moulds apparently which is cool the chocolate is differnt to most mass produced dark chocolate today very nice i think i wish we saw more orange and peppermint ones too theryre quite rare the only similar thing about today is in australia called cadburys snack which does indeed have five centres they should release it here dwe have the orange and the peppermint here  a bit more expensive but oh so nice  orange is my favi loved the  fruits as a child i had to endure piano lessons from an old nasty piano teacher and the only highlight was buying a frys five fruits from a milk bar on the way therei bet she hated the chocolate on my fingers eating away at her piano keys please bring them backat last i am not going madi even rang them up and they said they have never made a five centre bar beforei thought my childhood was just a dream and we never owned the sweet shop on county road in liverpool called county candywell thank god i was feeling like a five centres and i thought go on see again and check your not off your headso i did and there are people like me toowho are mad and beleive that five centres made their childhood wonderfulplease please please bring it backi will buy it forvevr and my childrens childrens childrenlet me know soon as i am craving it soooooooo muchandrea your customer for lifederek  the frys five boys bar was just chocolate without the creme centre it did indeed have the faces on including looks such as anticipation desperation etc lol i think it was discontinued in the s sadlythanks alan you have just saved a marriage and unfortunatly proved me wrong and the wife right yet again ive since found out that the five faces were desperation pacification expectation anticipation and realisationits frysthanksderek youre welcome lol  interetingly the bar was actually originally just called frys milk chocolate but already had the five faces on then they renamed it very cleverly it seems five boys did you know they had to give the boy ammonia to smell to make him pull some of the faces lol frys chocolate is my fathers favourite chocolate sadly now you can only buy the turkish delight and the cream bars all of which he likes luckily lolif the  fruits was discontinued in  when do cadbury claim the machine broke because when i was at uni our little campus sweet shop sold a version of the  fruits that was cocktail based  strawberry daiquiri etc it was gorgeous that would have been  so the machine must have been working then as each bar had  different flavours in itand to the person who asked about poppets yes i remember them too they were another childhood favourite of mine you can still get them but again the most interesting flavour is mint honestly who decides these things bring back the fruit flavourshave you seen the newest flavour  strawberry milkshake its very nice they also have the cookie one but im not fussed with that one lolooh no i havent seen the strawberry milkshake one but it sounds lovely ill have to keep my eyes peeled in the local newsagents and off licenseslindsay  i know the ones you mean not through eating them but by seeing the cocktail frys chocolate cream wrappers online lol i think they would have been a brief limited edition type of thing probably ive never seen them make anything like it since and were probably not all that successful i dont think they were really related to the original five centres but i see your point in the fact that they could still make them frys chocolate cream are the best ever made how dare someone say they are disgusting you have no taste you can get them at the hahndorf sweets in south australia please start making them again in australiai tried frys dark chocolate yesterday having seen it in local shop having tried bar when small remember enjoing soft centre i was so disappointed were was it look at packaging shows big soft centre its rubbish everything you make has changed including price you shouldnt keep name cadburys you should change to contrys were not stupid your just to busy filling pockets of share holders and fat cats just do us all a favour stop telling us your craft but rearly all you do is shaft the centres are still soft its partly the temperature theyre stored at when theyre cold the centre solidifies somewhat  the orange centre tends to be softer for some reason though i wouldnt say it was ruibbish though i think youre exagerating somewhat loli absolutely love the frys chocolate cream and to my horror have just lost a  bet  my friend said you could now buy this bar orange flavour and i said there is no way i would have known  do you know what he delivered me a bar today  it was delicious even though it cost me   does anyone know where and if the four flavour bar is available pleasethe orange flavour has been around for many decades theres also a peppermint one aswell which too has been around many decades im amazed youve not come across them before although you see them less than the original flavour to be fair  the other bar you refer too was the five centres unfortunately it was discontinued in  but you can get a similar bar sadly youll have to get it all the way from australia called cadbury snack not to be confused with our own cadbury snack their version has sx blocks of dairy milk each with a different filling and the relevant pattern etched onto each segment they include caramel coconut ice turkish delight ornage and pineapple well worth seeking outi adore this slim elegant little bar i agree with the reviewer that the plain version does have a distinctive scent that seems almost minty  but i think that it is testament to the quality of the bitter chocolate and its contrast with the sweet fondanti have in fact just this minute finished a frys mint chocolate bar delicious too but not quite as grown up as the chocolate cream simpleromg those were my nannys favorite chocolate bar id love it if they made a frys double chocolate cream and now i also want a dime bar was it a rowntrees brand bar that my dad mentioned he used to love those along with caramac bars maybe dimes suffered a demise when rowntrees were brought out by nestl was it kraft that brought them back as daim bars kraft and nestl are evilsaw a link to a page that says if  people like their page they gonna make my favourite again  frys  fruits  pineapple lime strawberry orange and raspberry mmmmmmmm nice to know im not the only onepost a link to the page  oif you hanker after a chocolate bar in a similar format and taste flavours as the old frys bars you could try chocolate cookie here in the uk as i know they are testing a range of similar confectionery ive even tasted some samplesdo you have a weblink for them i tried a search but came up with nothing i know theyve been selling their own fondant filled bars at the food fairs they attend in south east england  theyve got more flavours available now along with other similar treats like chocolate covered turkish delight  honeycomb their bars are very similar to the old frys ones but they use a better quality chocolate real flavours  a lot less sugar you should be able to find them on free index or try chocycooky on twitter or chocolate cookie on facebook i know they do export as ive friends in seattle who buy regularly from themwe live in small town nova scotia canada and there is a bulk barn here where they are trying to get quite a few british productscandies cookies etci was chatting with the manager as she was looking at her list of things to come they are definitely trying to bring in more british foodstheir latest being rowntrees pastilles well on her list she said out loud frys chocolate cream and i did a happy dance right there and then the last time i had a bar was  years ago when hubby went back to the uk and brought home my favourite stuffwalnut whirl not the same as original battenburg cake bakewell tarts and of course my frys bars i know that they will be small and overpriced but i will just have the savour it one bite at a timeplease please bring back this very yummy bar of fruit flavour  cream fondant chocolate  l dont enjoy any other bar of chocolate so do us all a favour and get this back on the sweet shop shelves thanksfrys cream bar and the peppermint version were two of my childhood favourites im watching what i eat these days and i had resisted buying them until this weekend  i bought an orange one and a peppermint one they always used to have a really rich dark chocolate which was quite bitter the orange one was incredibly sweet and the fondant was slightly grainy the chocolate was nothing like the original frys confection but what can you expect when cadburys get their hands on it  its not even made by cadburys but made under licence for cadbury so youve no idea whos making it and where i mentioned the sweetness there are g of sugar in a bar weighing only g so the damn thing is nearly all sugar yuk  ill stick to my memories of the real thing and i doubt ill even open the mint onewhile you make some interesting points i must point out cadburys and frys merged in   nearly a  years ago also by then frys had become known for producing poor quality chocolate and being financially poor hence the merger so the chocolates you remember eating as a youngster unless youre exceptionally elderly were produced by cadburys  also its a fondant bar  of course its mostly sugar thats what fondant is lol
the cadbury flake bar was originally launched in  the concept of the flake was discoved by a cadbury employee who filled the chocolate moulds once the moulds were full the excess chocolate used to spill over the edge and fold down in a stream of chocolate once this stream cooled the flake product was created as the texture had many thin layers of chocolate and was very crumbly and flakeygod bless that employeenow i must mention the wrapper it is a foil wrapper with a thin line of glue holding it together along the length it is then twisted xmas cracker style at each end it wasnt always like this for one there never used to be the glue and it it was easier to unwrap it needs to be easier to unwrap because you dont want to break the flake cadbury flake is a delicate little bar of scrumminess and should be worshipped in its completeness prior to the devourthe other thing that has changed is the wrapper material itself it wasnt always foil ill be honest i say i cant quite describe it can anyone help me on this but it was a plasticypaper that you could fold to enjoy your flakey moments you need to be able to fold the wrapper the climax of the flake experience is gathering all the flake crumbs and allowing them to slide down the folded wrapper onto your tongue i was left with no option but to gather up the crumbs by sticking my tongue out in order to pick them up most unbecoming of a sophisticated chocabloggertalking of sophisticated chocabloggers im hoping that simon will be kind enough to give us his opinion on flake dark when it is launched i have to admit that the idea of a flake made from dark chocolate just doesnt appeal to me and i really cant imagine sticking it in my icecream  stylequestions  is dark chocolate posher than milk chocolate will you switch to dark because of the health benifits does the higher quality of dark chocolate affect our treat time choicei love the way you make it so nice i have to go out of school to get one now because you made it so irresistible ps you ruined my dietmmmmmmmmmm that flake was soooo good          get one nowquestion for youis the flake less crumbly then it used to be or is it just meandy difficult to say how crumbly did you used to belolveryhi there i am currently doing a project about the sexualisation of cadburys flake at uni does anyone know of any books articles or sites where i could get some resourceful information on i am currently getting just nutrition sites and general overviews of cadburys flake any help would be wonderfulmany thanksi love flakes but the dark one is a no no  no noi just love cadburys flake its yummyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyybut it is not available in south east asian region such as malaysia i did eat it i love itim kates usa friend it looks good but dark chocolate would be better for my husband who is lactose intolerantflake is the best chocolate bar on the face of the planet how it melts in your mouth after each bit oh the warm chocolatiness that i lived for my life has been a barren wasteland for the past  years even the laughter of a baby or the cuteness of a puppy couldnt even shed a tiny ray of light on my abysmal dark world that i called my life i miss them so much where did you go and why did you leave me aloneall alone aaahhhhhhhh kidding but i have found a site to order them yahooo life is good again the sun is shining and the birds are singing  yes they are the best chocolate bar on the face of the planetbtw your blog is wonderful i am absolutely recommending it to my friendsbyenataliahi natalia i am from bangalore and have been looking for this ive had a few friends in mumbai look around but they havent been able to find it anywhere so could please tell me the name of these shops or a landmark near which to look for these shops thank younice review im eating a flake now pgaaaahhhh  i cant find flake dark anywhere now  i even checked ebay  nothing  it seems to be out of stock everywherei hope they fix that soonim on my last and for me milk chocolate just doesnt do it sorry milk chocolate lovershello everyoneim from dominican republic and a friend of mine gave me one bar of flake that she brought from the uk and now im crazy for this chocolate they are delicious but we dont find them here in dr where can i buy in malaysiawhere can i buy cadbury flake in malayasiayou can answer my questioni love cadbury flake it is the besti was just eating some flakey goodness at am free of guilt and got the urge to google i had no idea thats how flake came about i feel so enlightened  if youre in north america and have never had flake go to world market they sell the single bars and the multipacks and frys turkish makes homer simpsons donut noises but yeah where was i going with this thinks for a few seconds cant remember now but ill have to hunt down the dark chocolate version not really my thing but im curiousjust a quick question if i put a flake bar in the post will it reach its destination intactcrumble depends on how you pack it a few times ive managed to break them just getting them from the store to my apartment the structure is pretty fragile if you nudge it the wrong way just as tasty all crumbled up though and youll want to pay attention to whether your origin andor the destination are summery ive received melted chocolate in the post before not so yummyi studied in the uk and flake absolutely became my most favouriteest of chocolates ever never missed an opportunity to buy them now back in malaysia and  years later and still no flake i love the way it dissolves in our mouthmuuuhhhhomg how i wish i had a flake bar right now  youre right this review does not give this chocolate justice  just crumble them on top of ice cream and youll have a marvelous treat  i had such a hard time finding these chocolates in the states but i found a website wwwtheindianfoodstorecom that sells them for less than a buck  i bought  the second i saw it but now ive run outperhaps during christmas timeoh my those cadbury flakes seemed irresistible too bad for me im on fasting hmmn but a while after my break ill definitely have one
before i proceed a little history when i was  my parents bought me a sweet shop well they thought they were buying a business opportunity but i was  i lived in the shop for three years and consumed many times my body weight in cadbury mars and nestlethese days my tastes tend towards high cocoa content choccies  or more for milk  or more for plain belgium and switzerland ought to give me a medalearlier this year we went on the london eye and there was a competition to win a holiday in america all you had to do was to spot a giant golden egg that had been concealed on a rooftop and then say how high it was in millimetres well my wife did some fairly serious calculations but only managed the runner up prize  a gold plated bar of chocolatethe bar lay there gleaming too nice to eat nah course notwe started with an ungilded piece the chocolate is   about the limit for eating chocs really  and smelled fantastic it wasnt too sweet and as it melted you could catch a hint of the roast cocoa beans smooth as silk and deliciously rich this is definitely one of the best dark chocolate bars i have tasted its certainly enough for me to be very interested in other xocoa productsof course we didnt monster it all immediately  the advantage of such dark chocolate is that its actually quite hard to eat a large quantity in one sitting the gold leaf is almost unnoticeable i thought it would play havoc with fillings rather like foil but was pleasantly surprisedthere may be some minor health benefit to ingesting gold but i think it was just there for showwithout doubt the poshest chocolate i have eaten to date and well worth a taste although youd have to do without the goldi knew id seen the gold leaf chocolate before and i found out where from firebox but they are sold out now dohive been looking for some gold leaf chocolate for ages now just thought id let you know that its for sale on amazon uk ive just ordered some  will keep you posted
its ritter time againthis one however is a little different being solid dark chocolate  from the word fondente on the wrapper i had half expected it to have soft centre and found myself slightly miffed that it didntnow i was starting to worry about what exactly was in the bar and checked the ingredients no mention of ducks or any other avarian posteriasits also very moreish id polished off the whole bar in five minutes  and i wanted more and thats my only real complaint about this bar theres just not enough of itso if anyone from ritter happens to be reading this i have a suggestion instead of making your chocolate bars in g squares you should make them in g cubes and then send them all to methis is a very intersting site abt chocolateim trying to find where i could purchece a chochlate i was givin one of these ritter sports chocolate by an old stranger he stated something sweet for someone sweet the packaging says ritter sport dark chocolate  cocoa net wt  oz g now i cant find this label on any of the chocolate bars advertize on the internet from ritter sports so can some one help me find where this chocolate is fromthanksim from germany and i only want to say that there are g bars here are there the big bars at you toolulu ive not seen g bars here in the uk but ritter isnt that widely available anyway ill look out for them thoughi tried my first ritter two days ago im in west africa and i had never seen or heard about ritter till i ran into in the sweets section of of a large store the packaging was cutealthough nothing was written in english and there was no nutrition information i knew i was about downing  calories though anyway i did the edel bitter  cacao cause i hear dark chocolate is good i daresay i couldnt stop till i was done with the entire grams i look forward to trying out other flavours cool discovery for mecan u tell me where u bought tat dark chcooi recommend this chocolate very strongly ritter sport halbbitter is the finest tasting chocolate in the world  target used to carry it and then they dropped it  i think americans seeing the term bitter in the title are put off by that  ritter should adopt the english term semisweet instead  of course if they did not even target could keep the shelves stocked  its heaven
i chose to wait for the right moment to enjoy my nestle munchies a soak in an aromatic bubble bath a candle lit room a nice glass of wine a good filmthen open the munchies yes munchies deserve that dont theyso what did you think of the munchies i asked my son sometime later oh they were okay i guess he replied but i dont think ill get them againwhat a child of mine doesnt like munchies i immediately pulled out the family album to compare family features surely he must have been swapped at birthlater that evening my time had come i opened up the munchies popped one in my mouth just waiting for that delicious munchie moment i remember from all those years agothenmy mouth went motionless as i quickly checked that i had actually put a chocolate in my mouth and not some cardboard packaging i tasted another and looked closely at my old favourites to say i was disappointed is an understatement heck i hadnt felt this gutted since the interflora van pulled up outside my house on my last birthday and the delivery guy walked down the next door neighbours patha pack of munchies contains  individual chocolates milk chocolate with soft caramel and crisp biscuit centre is the description on the packet my argument  milk chocolate since when has milk chocolate tasted like dried out cardboard soft caramel ok so you dont loose a filling with the caramel but i doubt it would slowly drip the way only a good caramel can crisp biscuit fair enough i wont argue with thismaybe i had been unlucky enough to buy from a bad batch with this possibility in mind i went out and bought six more packs from different shops i did this because i am committed to my chocablogging dutiespsst  while dom isnt lookingbetween you and me its because i wasnt ready to accept that my yes my munchies had changedi accept the deal about wagon wheels and curly wurlies yeah yeah its me that has grown and not the confectionary that has shrunk well maybe i accept this but this isnt merely about size although size does matter sorry guys this is about the whole chocolate the whole taste the whole choccing thingthe result of the whole nine yards erm packs of munchies is that i hadnt bought a dud pack in the first place munchies are no longer the delicious little chocolates that made you wonder why they came in tubes and not in a fancy box they are no longer the scrummy delight that would sway you into accepting a second date should your beau present you with a pack to munch during the film they are now little more than a dry bland imitation of my dear sweet chocamemoriesyou can buy nestl munchies online using the links belowi too was sad when i tasted them the idea of them is so solidly good  but they were just bland grainy and sweetwhen i saw the title for this i thought ooo munchies that cow chocstress got their first damn but having read your review im rather glad that it was you that got to be bitterly disappointed and not me their  there  dohsometimes it is better to let childhood memories stay where they are  in childhood  syou made me want munchies and spoiled the dream oh well i have fond memories of my dad having them in the glove compartment in the car and wed be allowed one on a long trip somewheremmmmmm still tempted to buy some to confirm that they are not what i rememberhave munchies always been called munchies or were they known under a different name years agothere are some mint munchies which are plain chocolates with a mint flavoured fondant cream centre they were originally called mintola but the name was changed to mint munchies in june as far as im aware the name has never changed since the product was launchedthis munchies look all delicious ummm im already gettin hungry  well i wish i could eat some rite now mmm ive got the munchies they are gorge i could eat and eat them which isnt really a good thing i would like to contact nestle coz in my country they dnt get munchies and i love them so much they are my fav chocolate and i would like to ask maybe i can buy them online or they import them to maltai did a doubletake when i saw munchies for sale in a local shop about a month ago  i hadnt had munchies for about  yearsso i bought two packs one for me one for the missusi decided i must have a defective memory i was sure i used to like munchies but these were not very nice at allmy wifes reaction dont bother buying them againnestle are ever and must be shunned they destroyed munchies have you tasted a yorkie recently  also ruinedthe first time i had munchies was at the age of  years old after moving to america for the past  years im back in good old ireland and i saw my old love munchies n the corner shop by my old house and i practically came when i saw the pack of munchies so i shelled out the over the top  cent for the single pack of munchies and opened the wrapping and dropped  into my mouth at once and i honest to god almost cried i completely agree with you chocstress nestle have taken unreal chocolates and destroyed themi couldnt agree morenestle must and shall be shunnedi admit that i carry a cross and garlic in preparation should a nestle product come to within three feet of me but having been given a sack of mini kitkats i thought id give one a whirl the flavour was a violation is there any cocoa in that brown stuff around the edgesmy four year old girl turned to me and said poori couldnt agree morenow i carry an emergency folding travel stakeno i disagree i like themim sorry those pictures dont look like chocolates they look like wax creations of chocolates i live in the us so ive never had munchies although i have a friend from uk who said theyre her favorite but id be disappointed too if chocolate i bought looked that awfulwe as chocolate lovers have enjoyed your products over a combined  years and we have grown to love and respect the very brand that you portray your products and services have always been found of the upmost quality and we have no question in referring your brand to any other person whatsoeverduring one monster session we had the sudden urge to raid the fridge and chocolate draw and we had previously bought a tube of munchies we were suffering from an incredible bout of the munchies that we simply had to eat them our eyes lit up at the size of the tube of munchies and the veritable feast we were about to endure chocolate indulgence at its best so we sat down in our comfortable home our mouths salivating at the thought of them munchies sorting my munchies rrright out so we opened the packet inside the tube and pored the munchies from the bag into the tube we found there must have been some error in the packaging as the chocolates inside the tube were not even  deep of the cardboard container we are sorry we couldnt send you the packaging and the chocolates we were so hammered that the small amount of chocolates that was there were done rrright in within seconds and we were still majorly needing more chocolate to clench our major munchie attack so in the end we had to drive to kfc to do a bargain bucket in because we were pure starving after the measly portion of munchies that we had to fight over i felt the need to tell you our story because of the amount of tension that it caused within our household we would like to make a suggestion that it may have been the packaging machine at fault or the severe nature of our ravenous hunger for chocolate if you know what i mean you know what i mean lol many thanks for taking your time to read our thoughts any correspondence if not too much trouble would be greatly appreciated may i take this time to wish everyone at nestle a very happy new year for  kind regards just off for a bifta d
its a good thing that cadbury time out  come in multi packs because quite simply one is not enoughok so these multi packs contain smaller twin bars but stillcertain foods leave you wanting more when you have eaten what can be considered the correct portion and time out is one such food item moreish is the word to describe this chocolate is it just we brits who use the word moreishthe multi packs are found in the biscuit section of the supermarket so are they biscuits i think not im sure they are displayed alongside the other chocolate bars in smaller shops but having never looked for them in a smaller shop i couldnt say for certain  buy a single bar of chocolate not meif time out was a wafer covered in chocolate then id say yes its a biscuit but these fingers contain two thin light and crispy wafers which sandwich a slice of what appears to be flake or twirl this is all then covered in milk chocolate so you see more chocolate  less wafer  even dom may approve of thesethe pack states  two milk chocolate covered wafer fingers with milk chocolate centres i personally think that cadbury arent doing themselves any favours by describing it as a milk chocolate centre because this description tends to imply a solid centre the fact that the centre isnt solid but crumbly and soft is what makes time out so delicious so trust me on this dont be fooled by the wrapperare biscuits less guilt laden than chocolate bars do you suffer from chocaguilt if you answered yes to both these questions then time out is for you they were on the biscuit shelf mlud  we wont tell wow just swinging by but you have something quite nice going on here most food sites make me want to puke but yours is quite nicely done im not sure if you can keep the chocolate posts going but best of luck either wayi eat like  of these a day and now youve made me start craving kitkat and timeout are in no way identicalkitkat and timeout are not identical and who ever thinks that doesnt have a cluehey i like time out and its not as kit kat at all time out is the best but somehow i cant find it in canada and us at all its only in the uk whytime out  kit kat  i mean please i wish theyd sell them in the states too  as it is i have to rely on import and specialty stores and infrequent trips across the pond  i know of one each in denver salt lake provo and i think maybe billings montana  look around theres bound to be one somewhere nearish to where you liveoh and btw friends of mine who have tried them say they remind them of cookies and cream  its kinda truethey are sold here in australia too and have been since   years after the uki am eating one right now and was trying to describe it to someone which is why i found this sitekitkats dont have the same centre at all and though both are delicious and made by seperate companies i prefer timeoutscadburys time out just got even smaller yes again  the new singlefinger bar is  grams down from  grams  guess whether it costs lessi really love time outdear allwhere can i buy chocolate time outin kljust had onehi i cant seem to find timeout in the uk anymore
lion bar is another of those childhood favourites that brings back all sorts of good memories every time i buy it it was introduced in the s by rowntrees makers of kitkat smarties and aero amongst other things who were taken over by nestl in lion bar is not a sophisticated chocolate bar and has no pretentions of being so its just a good oldfashioned chocolate bar with loads of stuff crammed insidethe bar consists of a wafer filled with creamy stuff covered in caramel topped with crisped rice and coated in milk chocolatethe result is a chewy crispy chocolate bar thats really quite satisfying the ratio of crispyness to chewyness is just right the caramel is tasty and the chocolate is nice enough if nothing special but the overall effect is just right and a midmorning lion bar will fill you up just enough to keep you going until lunch timeall in all an unpretentious and yummy chocolate bar one word of advice though  dont keep this one in the fridge overnight if you do the caramel becomes rock hard and you lose all the chewynessi find this is best served at c with a nice cup of tea but then im british so i wouldmmmm feeling hungry now dont you find that the more choice that is available in a shop the harder it is to choose my husband went to albania for a year over there he had a choice of  decent bars to buy occasionally in england the choice gets to him and he has no idea what to gethellocould someone tell me where i can get lion bar pleasedear ddddddddd ihave summe some to my homewell i love lion bar and i would please u to tell me where i could find it im from canadaif you are in san francisco ca they have lion bars at this place called roxie market  deli on the corner of th ave and kirkham stthat bar looks like the australian version of cadburys picnic bar except the peanuts are missing also i cant believe your picnic has raisins in it eeeewits a decent and cheap chocolate bar still i think mars delight is betteror bountyor crispy snickers dyup you are right this chocolate brings back a lot of my childhood daysi am looking for this chocolate here in the philippines but cant find it do you know if they manufacture it in our country thanks this really is my favorite chocolate ever degrees centigrade thats pure insanity its much much better at  degrees  anyways this is another fantastic british candy bar that joins the ranks of such legends as coffee crisp and aero oh and the douchey temperature comment im just an american pointing out the ridiculousness of the the metric system di remember i used to eat this chocolate back when i was like  years old that was the midlate s back then the lion bar was half the size and had a beige plastic cover i still remember it after all those years because my brother and i used to be so obsessed about lion bar over any other chocolatei remember my mum used to get so upset coz we kept finishing whole boxes in like  daysshe always found new places to hide it from us  the ones that are sold these days taste a lot different and a lot worsei love lion candy bars  i discovered them in oslo norway and ate them like crazy when i was in europe  in the usa you can find lion candy bars in the store world market cheersum im eating a box of lion cereal at the momenti believe lion bars according to my grandad of course were launched in c by cadburys co ltd inc and were originally chewy caramel in milk chocolate they were taken over by nestl its too bad cadburys were the bestive had a lion bar and they are what you get if you took a kitkat and shoved it up the ass of a  grand bar tastygreat article  its fun to see how its changed over the years  we just tried the lion bar for the first time and posted a review on our international snack blog  take a lookhttpwwwworldofsnackscompostnestlelionbarhtml
chocolate is a complicated and confusing thing take these peanut mms for instance mms are quintessentially american of course in fact they were only introduced into the uk in the s yet theyre a thoroughly british inventionto complicate things further in the uk these peanut mms were known as peanut treets until  we also had toffee treets but im fairly sure there have never been toffee mms anywherefast forward to the present day and dom goes into his local shop and buys a small bag of peanut mms the main reason for this is that he has reviewed everything else in the shop already dom also enjoys talking about himself in the third person but this has little to do with mms  peanut or otherwiseah yes nearly forgot this was meant to be a review wasnt itto be honest theres very little to say about peanut mms theyre chocolate coated peanuts with a brightly coloured sugar shell simplei found the peanuts to be decidedly average in quality they werent bad but they didnt have a great deal of flavour and were a little dry ive definitely tasted better nutsthe chocolate was ok but theres so little of it its difficult to make a judgement either way the sugar coating was crispy and the colouring came off in my hand somewhat annoyinglyi got me hersheys drops with mms coating droolthe peanuts are definitely substandardthis is the yummiest blog ive surfed too all daycheers from toronto  okay  peanut mms arent a favorite of mine  but have you tried the peanutbutter mms  i knowamericans and their pb  but youve got to try theseim really not a peanut and chocolate fan i think peanuts in chocolate is just ruining nice chocolate i much prefer the taste of smarties chocolate than mm doesnt have the after taste tang found smarties in czech republic but named lentilky and taste pretty much the same as smartiesi bet youve tasted better nutsherlo the website is so delicious hahathis was very useful for me i will be using it for my project in history classpeanuts mmschocolate covered death for mei like the good ol fashioned mms which have no death traps lurking underneath the misleading surfacei want to buy chocolates of different variety in wholesale please replyi prefer the almond mms but there are only like  in the whole package phello good evening i please ask of me to report on the positioning of their products particularly chocolate peanut thanks for your attentioni pefer less shell and more chocolate and thats mmsthis was so helpful for my computers class and they are so good
this recent uk heatwave is not only melting my chocolate but its forcing me to look at alternative ways to get my chocafix dont get me wrong even on the hottest days when my choc du jour has melted beyond anything vaguely resembling a bar i still can never be persuaded from my chocaholic waysi took a left turn in the supermarket from the chocolate aisle and entered the frozen food section quickly bypassing the the oven chips and chicken nuggets my eyes soon fell upon the shiny cabinet of all things chocolateice cream blisswhen it comes to turning your traditional chocolate bar into an icecream version i reckon galaxy already have an advantage galaxy is softer meltier than other chocolate which is perfect for accompanying ice cream the vanilla ice cream is indeed as the wrapper states creamy and all in all i can not fault this bar in any wayi recommend leaving the bar for maybe a minute after taking from the freezer  just enough the allow the initial chill to subside this way the melt in your mouth chocolate and icecream  ratio works perfectly this said should you leave it too long the chocolate is thick enough to hold the icecream although the creaminess turns more to runniness still good but not the perfection we chocabloggers insist uponmmmm this looks yum are they sold in uk never seen them before  really must look betteryes they are in the uk i think most large supermarkets sell them in boxes of  they may be available individually from smaller shops  i must lookit is really yummy it is very favorite in ukgreate tastethanksu need picturesawh this ice cream bar is just like a little taste of heaven best eaten when left for a minute or two out of the freezer to melt a wee bit then the chocolate is soft nd the ice cream just plaays with your taste buds awh nicest ice cream ever pity i cant buy them in more shops in irelandwhy do none of the supermarkets no longer stock gakaxy vanilla heaven ice cream bars any stockists out there
just open the the chocolate cupboard in her kitchen if you dare and allow the multipacks to fall on your head then you will know what i mean luckily for the sake of any unsuspecting heads kitkats are quite light so ive never suffered more than a few minor grazes also its worth mentioning that mum now  is still rather trim which goes to prove that chocolate isnt to blame for weight gain personally i blame lettuce i can hear the dieticians shouting at me alreadyi guess it was the feeling of guilt i had with regard to doms terrible experience with the kitkat chunky peanut butter that i felt compelled to purchase a chunky kitkat that and the fact that woolworths were selling them for p  so i bought twothe wrapper is rather misleading a lovely picture of tiramisu leads you believe that that is what you going to get but you have to remember as dom said kitkats are rather bland no matter what they add to them but if you ignor the wrapper and disregard any tiramisu expectations then this chocolate bar is good it is what it says in the small print  flavoured accept that and you will enjoyanother plus point with this chunky bar is my  year took one look and said yuk saves me hiding them in the secret cupboardthis is very wrong who came up with this
a bit of a mouthful thats the best way to describe this both in terms of the name and the  contents of the barkitkat may be one of the best selling chocolate bars in the world but im quite sure that this particular bar isnt contributing a great deal to the sales figuresive never been a particular fan of kitkat finding them a little bland but this takes blandness to new levelsthe bar consists of a single very large finger of chocolate which is more like a brick than a finger with a thick wafer and a layer of peanut flavoured stuff im not sure what the stuff is but its certainly not like any peanut butter i know it has a vague  peanutty flavour but its really just a thick slightly dry artificial tasting pastethe chocolate is bland the wafer is dry and the peanut stuff is icky and all this is made worse by the design of the bar you cant just take a small chunk and when you bite it bits of wafer go everywherei really dont understand how or why they came up with this but they did  and i feel it my duty to warn you away from itthis is the first time i can remember that ive actually thrown a halfeaten chocolate bar away ickhere for click and comment monday from its about dawnhave a great day but i have to leave before i eat somethingwow it must be awful you actually threw out chocolatewow  a chocolate blog  i must be in heavena chocoloholics dream or nightmare come true  i will be back  and i will be looking for that chocolatepeppermint thingydo they have them in the us  i will find outi could not disagree with you more on this one i adore kit kat chunky peanut butter yeah i do agree that it is a lot to say in one go  i love peanut butter and i do like kit kats so this was a definate yes for me  i did not feel the same way about their bitter orange flavourhmmmm where can i get a one of these at pm on new years daybest wishesi think you are so wrong about kitkat chunky peanut butter bars theyre deliciousyoull be pleased to know that the same kind of nutbrick bar version was released in australia a couple of years ago and died an ignominous death  the last i saw of them was in a not quite right store trying to give them away at the cost of three for one dollar and they were well past their useby datejust wondering does the peanut butter taste like praline or is it really nutty i like peanuts and i like praline but i dont know whether i would like this any thoughtschocaholic neither really  it was just a dry artificial tasting paste i found the whole thing dry and franky rather disgusting but that is just my personal opinionsorry but could you tell me do you know the nutritional info on this barok i found this bar at my lucky esso and i had to try omg its absoluty gorgeous mmmmp im off to buy another onehii read this and i wonder if your description of the filling is really ojective if so  you have my sympathy here in poland kitkat peanut is produced locally by nestle polska and perhaps this is the whole difference our waffer is light the peanut filling is more like lightsoft peanut butter and the chocolate is an actually nice but perhaps not to be eaten separately milk chocolateim of this awful kind of people who eat bars by first skinning them of chocolate and then eating the parts by layers if possible and in case of kitkat peanut i did this more than once and i tell you  it is really really goodi hope someday you meet the right kitkat peanut srebrna i think you may well be right on all counts at some point in the future i may see if i can try another one of these from a different sourceand the only polishmade chocolate ive tried goplana i absolutely loved  so maybe you just have higher standards over there hithe difference may be  dont laugh  that when a new company nestle whatever comes they install new machines with wellknown procedures and ways of working totally new machines and new crew who sticks to the rules  because they were just taught them  the product may be a totally new quality in old factories where crew think they know absolutely everything by heart this may be not so wellif you were to try this kitkat again do check if it comes from poland or any other country where it has actually been introduced recently not the peanut one but all kitkats this may be the change of course the new owner may overdo and actually spoil the product this  allegedly  happened when cadbury bought wedel they put their new procedures in use on old machines and  wow surprise  the chocolate went bad totally so they fell back to the old procedures and they were back to good chocolatemy personal suspicion is that they cleaned the vats after somanyyears they were accumulating the chocolate layer ahh kit kat peanut is soooo yummy mmmmp i have to have one everyday yum yum yum lolyay someone who agrees with me they are sooo moreish mmmm  i am no longer alone haha my husband loves these keeps him quiet every time i buy him one the kitkat chunky peanut butter from switzerland is actually very nice comment from malaysiathe peanut taste is made from creamed peanuts by the way lolema xmmmmmmmmmmmmmm i love kit kat peanut and reeses peanut butter cupsthe best choc in the land d dif you shorten its name to pnunky it becomes less of a mouthfull it is also very nicewho allows such rubbish about one of the best chocolate bars around to be published a paerfect combination of chocolate goo and crispy stuff mmmhmmstrange i found it to be really nice the wafer isnt dry at all and when you bite it it doesnt go everywheremaybe you just had a shit bar hehechrish  thats certainly possible ill look out for another bar and if necessary do another reviewi love this kit kat but i once picked up a bad one laughs the wafer cracked and was hard and the chocolate tasted like cheap chocolate doesyou know the stuff and the peanut was hard and chewylucky for me it was just the oncethe rest have been fine phew d chucklesi admit i really wasnt a fan of peanut butter but this kitkat bar changed my mind  honestly its that good too bad your first peanut kitkat was a bad one i havent encountered a bad one yet though im simply addicted to them xd i wish they sell them back home i only get to buy them in these  in  kitkat chunk set packs original chunk white chocolate chunk and peanut butter at the hongkong airport  sadunbelievable how can anyone not like these just nicked one from my other half and its chilling in the fridge as we speakkitkat is greati love them and would gladly eat them instead of any other choc barmy idea of choccie heaven indeed ci want to try it but if you want to try one that really is badtry the caffeine snickers bar  its really bad  the first bite is okay but after the second or third bite the aftertaste kicks in and it takes like the syrup of ipecac you know the stuff to make you vomit very bad stuffchrisim another kit kat peanut butter fani had da duo one today eat it many ways yum i hate kitttttttt kattttttttttttmmmm they are so good selling out every day at the local supermarket i believe they are actually addictive was sceptical at first but after the first one was hooked im gna go take four chunkees and melt the ends slightly and stick them together to make a giant kitkat if only they sold the peanut butter in the small finger versionsi bought a peanut butter kitkat chunky to try today first i thought its gonna taste weird but infact its really nice i mean if you like peanut butter definately give this a try di definately have to agree with you that this kit kat bar is one of the most awful choccie bars out thereand those horrible cadbury boost with peanut bars too yuckyi tried them twice so far and am afraid i only had not nice ones myself but reading over this i have to go and try another one because technically this should be the most awesome stuff ever as far as chocolatepeanut goes of course not comparable to pure chocolate but thats a different story will get me one later today am totally intrigued now and hope its going to be niceohmy i love kitkat chunky with peanut butter its like heaventhis was my favourite kitkat  in fact my favourite lowsolids chocolate bar along with the elousive cote dor milk chocolate with pecans if you visit belgium seek one out eg in brussels train stations  they are stunning anyway they were a great temptation absolutely wonderful eaten cold from the fridge now theyre gone replaced by the caramel abomination as if an imitation kinder bueno senses wasnt dull enough now kitkat has come up with yet another caramel bar now theres an original throught  how clever of them to spot this unoccupied market niche it will serve them right when it tanks ok perhaps the margin was a bit thin on the pbc chunky  but i know lots of people who would have paid a bit more someone should send the nestle marketing department a copy of the long tailjakc  ill be reviewing the chunky caramel next week actually its odd because its fudge rather than carameldom  thanks for reply  il look forweard to the review though im still disinclined to knowingly buy any nestle products for the next little whilecheers ji actually quite enjoyed it its not something you could eat all in one sitting because it is very rich its a bit of a treat and i have to say kitkat has to be one of my favourite chocolate barsthese are one of he lushest chocolate bars ive ever tasted but i cant find them anywhere anymore have they been replaced by those new caramel onesim not too keen on caramel so i sincerely hope not please help im not capable of functioning properly with my peanutbutterkitkatchunkyfix back when they were still being made tos had packs for around  but if you can still find them send me an email and lets make a deal  ill take all you can findtheyre gone ive been looking around for these peanut butter bars of gold and have only managed to find old stock if you know where to get some let me know jakc ill fight ya for em ppeanut butter kitkat chunkies are the best chocolate ever i am so gutted they are gone especially after the kitkat chunky duos came out  of them in one wrapper amazingi just received a very welcome supply from my sister the globetrotter who found them in frankfurt she is currently in tirana albania where she has acquired some hazelnut cream ones  though she reports they are definitely not as goodits relevant that youve never been a fan of kitkati wonder what i would think of this peanut butter version given that i am a huge fan of kitkat chunky hallelujah  was in a village shop in wolverton warwickshire and they are back not quite the same as before more crunch less pb but still marvellous ok its not valhrona or pierre marcolini but it is unsurpassed in doing what it doesrejoice i saw the ads for the new kitkats on a bus in manchester yesterday  peanut butter kk is back now i just hope enough ppl vote for it dim having trouble with the concept of throwing a halfeaten chocolate bar away  its like not finishing a beer  all beer is good  some is great  same with chocolate imhoi agree i think its a bit too sweet i tend to pefer time outs maybe its because of the flakey chocolate centre between the wafers
the size and shape of this are exactly the same as the cappuccino bar  a thick g square slab divided into bitesize chunks unlike the cappuccino verson though this one is dark chocolatethe filling is a peppermint fondant giving an effect not dissimilar to frys peppermint cream except this is a whole lot nicerthe peppermint is strong and tangy without being overpowering and perfectly compliments the dark chocolate the overall effect is simply delicious and when chilled on a hot day like today c here in london today is deliciously refreshinggo out and find some of this nowi just found your site its a little hard to read at work as i am now drooling on my keyboardfizzlepopsparkthanks for the chocoinfodomage que je ne s est pas lire anglais car sa doit etre imteressantyou should try other ritter sport chocolates my favorite is ritter sport marzipan
whats the first thing that comes into your head when you hear thorntons for me its last minute christmas prezzie for gran or ive been having an affair but my wife will never notice if i bring her some nice chocolatesbasically the kind of gift you give if you have no imagination youre feeling guilty or youve left your christmas shopping until pm on christmas eveis it just me or do thorntons have an image problemat  for a g bag theyre quite expensive but then people dont usually buy thorntons chocolates for themselves do they  is a snip for a little guiltrelief after cheating on the wife i expectpersonally i think theyve overdone the coffee here i had a serious caffeine rush after eating just a couple annoyingly the ground coffee sprinkles are also more granular than ground giving them a slightly gritty texture almost like the chocs have been dipped into a jar of nescafe i think they would have been a whole lot nicer if theyd just dusted them with cocoa powderthe centres double cream and coffee are ok but not especially creamy i would have liked a little more cream and a little less coffee i think as it is its almost impossible to taste the chocolate because the coffee is so strong if im buying expensive white chocolate id quite like to be able to taste the chocolatethis is also the first time ive not been able to eat more than a few chocolates after the first couple i had what i can only describe as an extreme caffeine rush coupled with the slightly bitter coffee aftertaste thats all i could managethat said these arent bad in small doses but at the price i dont think ill be buying them againi think these are absaloutly georgeous i could eat them all day they are my fravriot chocolate ever loli work in thorntons and i think you will find the cappuccino from the continental range is actually one of the most popular that we sell  never before have i heard anyone complain about the strength of the coffee filling  being a coffee hater myself i was plesantly surprised at the taste  i believe the filling to be creamy in texture and dont think believe it to be overpoweringthese are absolutely scrummylicious caffeine rush granulated topping mmmmmmm do not change one little thing about these absolutyely orgasmic chocolates world number one fanjust finished a bag of these they have got more of a coffee taste than before and i am sure there are less in a bag oh and not be a perfectionist but the topping is cocoa poweredi would try the bar form as well as it works out cheaper as  bar  around  chocolates
still here good toblerone was originally created in  by theodore tobler and emil baumann the name comes from tobler and torrone the italian word for the almond honey nougat in the chocolate and presumably at some point they decided that baumannone didnt have quite the same ring to ita year after its creation the toblerone became the first chocolate product ever to be patentedthe distinctive shape of toblerone represents the shape of the matterhorn in the swiss alps  which also forms the logo on the packagingok enough historytoblerone was one of those chocolates that was always around at christmas when i was a kid but it was always a gift from some family friend or relative we never really bought it for ourselves i think this was primarily because its quite expensive but also because it was regarded as just a little bit naff  a bit like ferrero rocherthis was the first bar id had since those days and it was simply delicious the chocoate is smooth and tasty and the flecks of nougat are chewy and add texture you dont really taste the honey or almonds but the overall effect is distinctively tobleronei do have one gripe though the shape yes im a philistine  but its just such a waste particularly in the small bar pictured here maybe im triangularistnearly half the packaging is taken up by air and i dont like paying for air the makers kraft do now make a range of chocolate but theyre all still that triangular shape if it was available in a standard bar id probably buy it moreregularly but for now i suspect this will remain primarily a christmas treat when i steal it from friends and familyi think they sell it primarily by the shape i mean the ads they show for them now all emphasize pretty women unsuccessfully hiding a piece of the bar in their cheek producing a telltale bulgehiits very good chocolate with honey and almond nougatdjuss chocolate eat it no need to think about it damnnn ppli love chocolate and toblerone is the best one around yumhoneyalmondnougat       i love the chocolate in especial the tobleron bod i have a daud how invented the chocolate tobleroni really like the chocolatebut would like and buy more  if there were also a say  less sugared version sugar rate feels high with most packed sweets and so many people would rather a less sugary tastei value the unique shape  texture and taste except a bit sugaryness
but firstly a quick note to our american readers what you know as milky way is what the rest of the world knows as a mars bar and what the rest of the world calls a milky way you call  musketeers i dont know why  it just iswhat ive always liked best about milky way is the fluffy creamy nougat its just yummy the very thin layer of milk chocolate is really just there to keep the fluffiness from escapingafter  years of experimentation i have discovered the best way to eat milky way is at c f too cold and the nougat goes hard and chewy too warm and it just goes icky then just bite into it and let it melt in your mouth heaventhere is in fact only one downside with milky way and thats that you get funny looks when you buy them if youre more than  years old this can make them very difficult to get hold of for us grown upsstealing them isnt on because the shame of getting caught shoplifting milky ways is even worse than the shame of buying them hanging around outside sweet shops and offering kids money to go and buy milky ways isnt really an option in this day and age either  and kids these days just run off with your money anyway  dont ask me how i know this pleasehow do you know thiswell i had to ask didnt i ok your milky way which is our muskateers is utterly adult to purchase on this side of the pond here it is touted as a healthier candy bar since it is less calorie dense then say a mars bar which is a milky way here they even have these commercials with all these gigglng women in offices bc the  muskateers all start floating due to how lite they arei still think they are yumarooim confused by the whole marsmilky way thing your milky way looks exactly like my milky way and nothing like my mars im in new zealand whats the diff btw your milky way and the  muskateers thing they look the same to me but we dont have muskateers herenicola  were in the uk and i think milky way  mars are the same here as they are there its just america usa canada south  central america where its different as far as i knowjust to add to the confusion they dont actually have anything called a mars bar in the us any more the chocolate they used to call mars bar is now called snickers almondahhh that makes sense then sorry i assumed this was based on american candy snickers almond are delish have no idea why they would call that a mars tho mars doesnt have nuts crazy americans p heheodd well whatever they call it over there usa here i could skip this one or have about  of them smashed together that might be tastyas a fellow chocoholic i love a milky way or two  although i have to say i prefer the original milky way which was a dark blue wrapper with red writing and had a soft milk chocolate centreinstead of the current white chocolate i tell everyone this but few remember the old way lol bring back the old milky way xxxxmars and milky way are two different things here in aussiehi i coming from norway and i love miky wayi am soooo glad that someone else remembers the old milkyway as trying to tell my husband it was brown inside was like trying to tell him that a jam doughnut has got jam in the middle  bravoin poland milky way is just milky way and i like it ok i also remember the old milky way and loved it need to see a picture but its almost impossible to find onebring back the old school milkywaypleasei remember too bring back the old school milkyway that had chocolate coloured filling instead of white its never been quite the same and im having trouble trying to prove to my friend eddiemund that it wasnt always whiteeddiemund you are wrong they were chocolate coloured inside xkes is right on this onethe difference was subtle but the filling used to be darker and slightly heavier closer to the nougat in a mars bar the modern version is lighter both in colour and texturethanks for the support dom  just need to find a picture to support the argumentyour all wrong i tell youwe arent wrong eddie it is you who is mistaken i clearly remember them being brown inside and they tasted better then tomilky way of old was basically a mars without the caramel and was about half the sizebasically what is now known as a flyte  these guys are right eddie sorryconfusion could have of course arisen because in the us a milky way is what the european market knows as a mars barand who remembers the red car and blue car adverthttpwwwdailymotioncomvideoxnfamilkywayadvertshortfilmscould you please settle an argument and tell me when the white filling in a milky way was first used i remember the old milk chocoloate filling but someone older than me  i am  argues that it was always whitei remember it well it was a sad day for me when the recipe changed as i dont like the new sickly uk milky waysbut the world was right again when i found the flyte bars which are the old milky ways if you can find the flyte launch date then that will be around the time that the recipe changedi am now concerned with the production of milky ways though as not even the staff noticed that they were packing a new product maybe they should have made the middle bright green loli also worked for mars and although it was after these changes as i was in marketing it was my job to know about this sorry eddie they did changethinking about it i would guess early to mid nineties definitely before i worked for them in  but you all probably knew it wouldnt have been as late as thatbummer i prob should have went in to work morejust had a major debate with my family around the christmas dinner table that the origional milky way had a brown filling  this website and all of the comments helped to prove me right  i just wish i could find a picturewow after several years of trying to convince my mates that there was an original version of milky way i have finally realised i am not crazy i remember the advertising when the centre changed to white i think it was a cartoon set in space with the milky way bar floating anyone rememberha ha the milkyway debate is still going strong months later eddie you may find the old style one on your travels around the world let us knowi am  and i have just sat down and scoffed a double bar of milky way and found the white creamier centre far too sickly there is too much vanilla in them if it makes me feel sick what on earth is it doing to our kids i remember the old adverts stating that its the sweet you can eat between meals without ruining your appetite which basically told kids that it was ok to eat before dinner well after eating that i feel so sick i dont want to eat anymorehttpenwikipediaorgwikimilkywaybarmilky ways  does anyone remember when they had the brown centre and not the white like nowthe old milky ways were a darker brown colour in the centres  and much nicer  i am  and i must have been about  or  possibly when they were still this colour  the white filling is not a patch on the original one  far too fluffy and sickly  bring back the original version for the love of godglad i found this blog just had a conversation about it with my partner and he didnt remember the old onethey definately changes from brown  they were brown when i was at primary school im  now  we used to bite off all the chocolate and then chase people round the playground with what looked like a blob of something disgusting you can imagine on the end of our fingers  the white ones were first sold alongside the brown ones as a special edition then the brown ones just disappeared  no one ever believes me eitheri love milky waysim so glad i found this sit been telling my boyfriend all night that they used to be brown in the middle and he didnt believe me not that he does now even though i have shown him all the comments really wish i had some photographic evidencefound this blog after doing a google for milky way as trying to find the old school milky way as hate the new one have contacted mars to ask for them to have both the old one chocolatey fluffy centre dark blue wrapper as well as the new white centred one as per pic above a flyte is very similar and as near to the old milky way but can only buy in a twin bar so eat twice as much i think there should be a petition to mars to bring back the old milky wayall i can say to the people who dont believe that the inside of a milky way used to be light brown is that you are too young i am fifty and remember them from the s i landed on this web site because i am searching for a graphic of the original dark blue wrapper it is so many years since i bought a milky way that i was surprised to read here that they are now white insidei totally had to mention on here that the darker centred milky way bars definately used to existand im pretty sure that drew is right about the space advert making a point of how the centre had changed to a lighter tastier white filling but i dont think it was a cartoon seem to remember it being a regular video clip of a boythe original milky way bars were defo more tastey in my opionion  bring back the old milky waywell im  and even i remember the old milky ways and i definitely also remember the advert when they were changing the middle and my parents tutted to this none of my friends believe me when i talk about the old milkyways not even the old ones although my parents remember them and definitely agree that they were better i reckon i must be one of the youngest that can actually remember themim not sure if someone has already mentioned this as i havent read through every postthe old milky ways were the best how come noone remembers them and are very similar to the flyte barsok im  and i remember when the limited edition white milky ways came out along side the original brown centred one   im pretty sure it was between  when they changed do you remember the advert that was about them being lighter than milk my dad actually tried to float one on milk and it did indeed work    i was about  and very impressedim in the uk  and i dont no wat anys on about firstly im ten and i buy milky way they are well nice i bite the chocolate off the top stick my finger in scoop out the inside also my brother is twelve and my sis is  they buy milky ways and dont get funny luks so ha lastly to the american why put almonds in a mars bar its just not rightmmm milky way  its sad how they take away the good stuff  like take at last confirmation and clear proof that the current milky way bar has changed the flyte bar is from what i can remember almost identical to the original milkyway bar debate over period long live flytehello im from norway and we dont have a lot of milky ways here but sometimes im out traveling in the country i might go into a  and i pass by a milky way i gotta buy it even if i just planned to buy something to drink i have to buy it xd and im a total chocoholic gotta love it just eaten a milky way for the first time since they changed it  i definitely prefer the original  why change something that is already great  bring back the originalfor all you non believers check wikipedia it confirms the old flavour was chocolateive had this argument so many times and dont understand why people dont remember the old centresee quote from wikipedia below originally available within europe only in chocolate flavor the center changed to vanilla flavor in  although the chocolate flavor still remains available in australiaproof at lasthi couldnt agree more i used to love mikly way now it tastes like sti think the centre changed in  not i thought i was the only one who remembered milky ways being brown everyone thinks i am insane i loved the old ones and i hate the new ones but i have found an alternative in flyte barstheyre a low fat choc bar and theyre basically exactly how i remember old milky ways i love themhas anyone else seen the vintage milky way ad with the red and blue cars shown on tv recently ive seen it on living tv all this week i wonder if that means the old favourites are coming back how exciting  it could just be that the ad is  years old nowhttpvwwwyoutubecomwatchvydlsmijpci am glad i am not going madi much preferred the old milky waysi am  from my childhoodwhy do they change things when theres nothing wrong with them in the first placebring back the old recipe to support the new showing of the vintage advertcant believe this blog was just arguing about the fact of the different centres no one but me and a colleague at work could remember the centre being a different colour cant wait to get to work on monday nowwell that just makes me glad i live in australia we have the original brown centred milky way  and also the strawberry flavoured one that noone else has mentionedi remember the mars midnight bars they were dark chocolate with a vanilla centre and caramel in the normal mars bar configuration  they didnt lasdt long at allof course we now have mars red which they cheekily claim to be half the fat of a normal mars bar  they do this by making the centre lighter but mostly by reducing the size from g down to g thats marketing for youi have just seen the blue car red car advert on the tvit was pantslolam so glad people remember the brown centre milky way  my dad has worked at mars for  years and used to bring them home by the bag full   glad u believe me now chris  x i remember when the new milkyways with the white centre came out and it was a novelty we really enjoyed them but then a few years later i realised we had been cheated  where was the original nowhere to be seen i just seen the red car   blue car advert and thought wow are they bringing back the old milkways at last but alas no although maybe a case for false advertising as the advert clearly depicts the original and superior milkyway bar i remember the words saying smart old blue not good old blue and yes i see on youtube the original advert did have those words is it not politically correct to call blue smart for not gorging on prickly trees and trucks these days would it be insinuating that red is stupid and we cant say something so bold as that in  i hate this millenium so fari absolute adore milky ways  there are the regular ones with the light brown center with a light coat of caramel under chocolate milk and the new dark chocolate with the white center  i much prefer the regular one  milky way is for me what popcorn is for many americans when they go to the movies  viva milky wayi love milky ways they are do delicous i love the way that they melt in you mouth uuummmmmmm  i remember back in the s and s that milky ways were delicious then at some point in time i think it was the s they completey changed the ingredients inside it looked white instead of the usual brownbut most of all the taste it was disgusting why they would change a winning formula is beyond belief thats a bit like coca cola sayingwe have a fantastic drink that sells millions worldwide lets change it so it doesnt taste the same it shouldnt happen all they had to do was market an alternative to milky way and keep the original if only people would leave things alonei dont know about the s s milky way and musketeers but us milkyway is like a haven to me i think it far better the musketters the melted chocolate flowing in your mouth in each bite means every thing to me go milky wayhere in us musketeers has white substance inside and milky way has dark chocolate inside it has two flavors though dark chocolatemidnight flavor and creamy chocolate my favorite ohhh i a thought i was the only one who insists that milkyway used to be chocolate flavoured inside rather than the sickly milk flavour  no one else i know remembers either i only stumbled upon this site as i was searching the net to see who makes it so i can work out how many slimming world syns is in one how can the usa not have mars bar it has to be the worlds best chocolate bar ever  cold from the fridge  snickers doesnt really compare  infact didnt we have a mars almond here for a short while  ltd edition like the mars dark another yuummmmi remember the old style and im  born  so it must have been early s they changed as i dont really have much of a memory before this point you know being a small child and everythingyoure right i was born in  and although everyone seems to think they changed in  it was actually  theres an ad on youtube from  telling us all about the new light white whipped centre the  ad and follow up from  plainly show the old darker centreu all need shot i remember the exact year was  at time world cup was in mexicothey took out the white ones as limited editions and stupidly kept them and ruined many livesit def wasnt that far back  i was only  in  i ate milky eays well into childhood and past lol they were chocolate until the early si have started a facebook campaign to bring back the old milky way help guys paul im  and remember the old brown ones and the white ones coming out as limited edition so they cant have been  when that happened as i wasnt born until  it must have been early s when it happenedi clearly remember the brown middled ones and im pretty sure they stopped being available in the nineties im  and definitely ate them when i was older than  as i wouldve been in  maybe they brought them out in the white middled special edition earlier in europe than in the uk and then ruined it all for everyone some time in the nineties i remember the old wrappings  the dark blue wrapper was more papery somehow when you ripped into it now i want a brown middled milky way and i also now want a secret bar was it a terrys brand bar that someone mentioned i used to love those those and the terrys moments bar made of hexagons of choc with caramel and a whole hazelnut in the centre of each segment yummmmm maybe they suffered a demise when terrys got bought out or something was it kraft that bought them evil krafti used to love secret bars mmm they were actually made by nestle rowntree  originally branded rowntrees as nestle was still releasing chocs in the rowntrees and mackintoshs name in the early s then towards the end around  they had become nestle like walnut whips etc i always thought it a shame theyre all nestle now grrrno matter what you all say i know am right and there aint anything you can do about it u bunch of losersi think there not the same and look how little they are now i think they should sort it outam so happy that av seen that am nt the only one  remember the old filling i am  and still remember i had a debate with every at work day and nobody believed me bt nw av got proof does ny no exactly wat year and does ny have a pici dont know why everyone keeps talking about the old milkyway here in australia we always have the chocolate centred one i looked at that picture of the white centred one and i thought it looks really strange then i realised that australia has what you call the old milkyway anyway that white one looks really yum is it white chocolate flavouredoh yeah and i forgot to give you a picture of the chocolate centred milkways well heres some pictures one of them is the packaging which says chocolate whip and the other is a picture of the actual chocolatei had to take a bite to show you the chocolate centre httpsphotobucketcomalbumsacdonkeytell me if you think this is the same one and tell me if you like it i had to steal my sisters camera by the way so you should be gratefuli am so glad i found this website as i have just had a debate with my boyfriend about how they used to be brown in the middle in the uk he insisted they never were so thank you for reassuring me that im not going mad looked on wikipedia before going on here and it states that australia still do the brown ones toothanks for your pictures juliette  musketeers are still chocolatey in the middle here in the usbrown and betterwheres eddielol this thread has been going on for  yearsjust to confuse the whole marsbar debate in south africa they used to call it bar onelyn thank you sometimes i think i am the only person in the uk to remember the original milky way it was brilliant and not at all like the sticky one we now have it was more of a firm chocolate mousse i really wish theyd bnring them back xmiky way bear nicein australia they have recently started stocking a new brand of chocolate in safeway that are really cheap like c for a g bar anyway i picked one up today called ellano and it is so much like milky way but it has a think coating of milk chocolate very nice and less fat than milky waywherever you remember or not cadburys version of milky way was completley different to the one today the cadbury version was a small bar of white chocolate with a creamcoloured wrapper and the name in blue on it cadbury also made mars bars bounty bars and maltesers during the good old british dayscadburys have never made milky ways mars bars bounty bars or maltesers theyre all mars products cadburys did occassionally launch products which were similar to bars such as mars bars like the aztec in the s but they couldnt compete the mars bar came over here from america when forrest mars son of the man who made mars bars fell out with his father and started making modified versions here in the uk in the s however during the war many manufacturers did make other makers chocolates so you may get a kitkat saying made by cadburys for rowntrees due to the rationing quotas and such like imposed by the governmentive heard an internet rumour that cadburys used to make the chocolate for mars bars ive also heard that they make the chocolate for pallas foodswell they are mars products now even though milky way has changedits nestl with a fadamy dad used to love caramacs they were made by nestl cadbury originally branded cadburys since cadbury sold its biggest selling brands to nestl in  then in  it became a full nestl brand like kitkat smarties and aero it used to be like dimedaim bars with a crunchy caramel center but after becoming a full nestl brand it became caramelflavored chocolate nestl should not mess with perfectly good cadbury brands like caramac the jingle was caramac whoawoooa caramac that was a memorable jingle if only nestl did not make caramacsean i think youve got very confused with your brandschocolate companies nestle and cadbury were never together caramacs were originally made by mackintoshs and were always caramel flavoured chocolate they were never made by cadburys i know this as i have an original caramac rowntrees and mackintoshs joined in the late s to become rowntree mackintosh which was bought by nestle in  in the early s rowntree branded chocolate became nestles with only the sugar confectionary bearing the rowntree name sadly the mackintosh name no longer survives in the uk at leasti dont recall mackintosh ever exsisting rowntree made several sweets such as fruit pastiles and also a special dark chocolate royal dark caramacs were made by cadbury by the way do you mean the wrapper or the full baryou are thinking im confused but im not read my lips caramac was made by cadbury i really want a retro aero bar made by cadbury the original makers and now i want a topic were they a cadbury brand that my dad told me they were nougat and cherries covered in chocolate i want a topic nowcaramacs have never been made by cadburys trust me  they do a caramel bar though aeros have also never been made by cadbury in the uk at least and in the rest of the markets they were made or sold in either i dont supose they were rowntrees invention though the name was offered to cadbury but they turned it down as they had no use for it at the time topics are made by mars and always have been they also never had cherries in they have hazlenuts in out of date i presume im not confusedby the way what other old wrappers and bars do you haveyeah its certainly out of date  i have lots of different bars wrappers and dummy bars etc wrappers wise i have to many to mention spanning many eras bar wise i have crunchies an old marathon the caramac smarties treets fruit pastilles and more all of varying ages some very early others not so early but still old did you like the mentioned sweets as a kidyeah i enjoyed all of them as a kid still do in fact except marathom or snickers as it is now never been so keen on them they just happened to be some of the bars ive managed to buy amongst others there have been others which ive missed out on getting inc a early double decker from the mid s which was when it was first launched but i guess you cant win em all lolout of all those sweets which is your favoriteremember lion bars they were crisp rice and caramel covered in milk chocolate my dad used to love thosei do know lion bars my dad is also a fan  i tend to prefer picnics maybe its the inclusion of the raisins and peanuts loli clearly love crunchies they are very nice and crispetycrunchety i want a dark chocolate crunchie with orange honeycomb centre and now i also want a butterfinger are they a hersheys brand that my friend oshin moran mentioned it is a crunchy carameltype peanut butterflavored centre covered in chocolate rowntree made lots of confections before they were brought out where they brought by nestl evil nestli also like cruncies that dark chocolate and orange one would be fab i love orange did you know they once did a limited edition tango flavoured crunchie also a mint twice champagne and lemonade as limited editions a good few yearsa go i recall them being very nice i also found pictures of a peppermint crunchie from the syeah rowntree were sadly bought out by nestle in the s its a shame because i think their bars were better before do you have any vintage kit kat bars or wrappersi do indeed i have various kitkat wrappers from relatively recent ones to older ones from the searly s ive not got any really early kk wrappers the older the wrappers in general the more expensive they seem to be grrr lol i also have a couple of kitkat bars again not the oldest but ones from  the original limited edition dark four fingerdo you have any vintage mars wrappers or barsi do indeed off the top of my head i have at least one very vintage mars wrapper and countless other variations and  and so onvintage mars wrapper from which yearyour blog was the only hit when i googled for caramac and entirely new confection from what i remember caramac had the entirely new confection wrapper for ages any idea how long i wouldnt be surprised if it was a decade

when i was a wee nipper frys turkish delight was about as exotic and sophisticated as you could get on the confectionary aisle  the television advertisements were full of exotic beauties probably hailing from ipswich but hey they had jewels in their belly buttons so to a kid that was as good as a turkish princess  not quite sure why they always had to be buried in sand by the end though  so it was with some excitement that i brought home a turkish delight from tescos earlier this weekthe packaging claims that it is full of eastern promise and that the bar is still as good as ever  the latter statement triggers my inner cynic for a short while especially as its an old favourite relaunched by cadbury but im lured back by the luxurious look of the metallic purplepink of the wrappingon opening the wrapper though im disappointed  what is revealed is a bland rectangular slab measuring cm x cm x cm and with  ridges on the top  just like youd find on countless numbers of chocolate bars on the market  its competition has moved on  it no longer looks the rich sophisticate  as you can see from the photo the chocolate was cracked on mine  a problem endemic with the crisp layer of chocolate on a flexible filling yes ive now eaten several of these  the extremes i go to for proper chocolate research i hope youre impressedmy nostalgia somewhat tempered i bite into the bar  im immediately impressed with the crunch of a generous layer of proper cadbury milk chocolate  and lets face it in the milk chocolate stakes theres not much that beats cadburys  the interior takes a little more getting used to  the filling in a turkish delight is far removed from real turkish delight  imagine instead a firm jelly flavoured with the essence of rose and overdosed with sugar and you wont be far off  it is pretty sicklyoddly though once youre used to it the combination works  maybe its my diehard sweet tooth which always gets in a shall i have chocolate shall i have some sweets dilemma which is nicely eradicated in the one bar  maybe its just nostalgia winning out over common sense  either way im looking forward to the next onethere may well be many more exotic and sophisticated chocolate bars in the confectionary aisle these days and to be perfectly fair i have to state that frys turkish delight can no longer compete in those lofty circles  but its still a pleasant little bar above the norm of your every day chocolate snack and highly recommended to sugarholicsive always wondered what turkish delight was since reading lion witch and wardrobe many years ago forgot about it then saw the movie this doesnt look like thatand i would think turkish delight would be figgy datey or nectariney this looks like plum or cherry or some other berry or just rose sugardom one word  no briani kind of liked it but i like a lot of persian sweets with floral flavors birdwoman  yeah this is nothing like the real turkish delight  find yourself an ethnic market where they make it fresh im rather partial to the rose flavor but lemon is nice tooomg i love your blog except that its making me really want chocolate like now that sounds revoltingand quite normal you could coat cardboard in chocolate and id be game to try itfrys turkish delight is one of the best ways to make me happy it took some getting used to but once you have you cant get enough i like the cadburys version too even the ice cream version mmmmmmoii please answer our questons quickly only got half an hour left me need  no luvs ya  xyou know the funny thing about research tasks is that youre supposed to actually research it yourselfchop chop youve only got half an hour i suggest you start with google to find the company home page im sure ill be riddled with guilt all dayor in the words of the great catherine tateam i bovveredomgg  we woz just ehm askin for sum help  no need for you to be horribleyhbt handfrys turkish delight is my number  fave chocolate bar it was my mums too i also like real turkish delight too which as you have all said is completely different in australia cadburys does a block of chocolate with turkish delight which is good too but the bar is way betterhey im katie and i love turkish delight and i dont care what anyone else says i love it when you take your first bite and its like jelly on the inside and after having that first bite you just want more i am addicted to it i love it and its my number  favourite chocolate    d d dwhat can i say really great i adore chocolate  wow turkish chocolateyamyyywhy dont you make a  or g net block i sure they would sell like hot cakes but must be like the  g block thick and solid filling not liquidim not sure you could really say it was relaunched by cadbury since it never left our shelves did it as far as i know frys launched it in  and cadburys bought frys out in  so i guess its actually been made by cadburys nearly since its inception under the frys brand also i think the chocolate is more frys recipe than cadburys ie certainly not dairy milk or cadburys secondary recipe lolgreat review  we just tried frys turkish delight for the first time for  our international snack blog  take a look
there are certain chocolates i loved when i was a kid that i still love now but feel slightly awkward buying  simply because im not  any moreamongst my childhood favourites were milky way curly wurly and these  revels im not entirely sure why i like them i think its because you never quite know what youre going to get in a packet of revelsas a kid one of my favourite games was to make a friend who couldnt stand coffee eat revels  a oneinsix chance of making a friend horribly ill is an incredibly satisfying game for a ten year old and a thirty six year old come to thatpersonally though i like them all my only complaint is that there arent enough orange ones i want more orange revels do you hear mei remember loving a snack like that when i lived in englandin the early s did revels have raisinscaramelcookies in them or am i thinking of something elseok now i want these and theres absolutely no way im going to get them im betting wawa doesnt sell themso i went to this shop here that sells british stuff and got me a bag of revels the big bag cos thats all they had i was rather excited after reading all about them here and paid a lot more than i normally would for chocolate i was especially looking forward to the coffee and orange ones and the caramel ones however i was pretty disappointed overall the fillings were totally average the raisin ones are waste of time plus they all fall to the bottom so you have to eat them last ew the only ones i liked were chocolate buttons and maltesers which you can get here in nz anyways nevermind this shop had heaps of goodies so ill try some other stuff in consultation with chocablog of course those lion bars look like theyll be next on the list kinda like a picnic but not quite interestingewwwww  i used to love revels and buy them buy the packet load the bigger the better  but now what have they done  put raisins in them  awful awful awful  how could they  i hate raisins and they make the bag smell and all the other chocolate smells and tastes of raisins too  yuk  i love all the others even the coffee ones but now i cant bear to eat them at all  its a terrible thingrevels roulette is a familiar game for me  im allergic though not severely to the orange ones while its pretty easy to tell revels apart the two that look and feel exactly the same are orange and my favourite coffee still love em thoughinteresting peamix that you smell the raisins maybe your nose naturally picks out what you are most averse to  to me the bag stinks of citrushello there i thought i would write this as i have eatten revels for many years and by looking at the size of me i should have shares in revels my question to you is simple why on earth did you change the peanut with a misserable raisin  you have destroyed my faith not only in this product but the whole blooming industry please ensure me that this tragic mistake will be rectifiedgareth annoyed warlowhey i think they should make a revel bar like the smartie one  segments each with one of the flavours or a quality street bar each piece could have each different flavour warapped in the luscious chocci hahai like revels they make me spunk in my trousers sometimes because they are sooooooooooooo good yummyi cant believe theyve replaced my favourite nuts with nasty raisins when did that happen surely it is illegal now i have to dodge the coffee flavour and the raisins hmmi think that there is way to many orange revels bring on the maltesersss was there ever an strawberry revel more vareity of the revel family needed bring inthe revelsssmore orange revels i get waayyy too many as it ismore coffee ones i sayshould bring out a bag of each flavour xxcoconut ones why why why have they taken them outi think it would be great if they did like fudgeshortcaketurkish delightliquorewhite choc or peanut butter revels or something i was just thinking of these after consuming a g bag phew im full dont think ill be eating any chocolate for a whilechocgal that is actually an excellent idea and its a shame that mars are too boring to make revels or any of their stuff really more interestingwell thankyou terry  mars should be more adventurous improve there products p well you never know the makers might read this blog hawell im sure the mars planets have bombed so mars will be even more cautious now still if you check my blog im not spamming honest then youll see i put a news article up yesterday that mars will be releasing a new product for christmasno word on new revels flavours though maybe you should send them an emailyes i might just do thathai think that probably the reason the peanut ones were replaced is beause more people would be allergic to them i love the raisin ones though one of my favouritesits funny that you dont ever have enough orange ones in yours though cause thats all i ever seem to gethi there is there any feedback on that turkish delight question im sure there were never turkish delight revels anyone let me knowand to the last question i dont think theres ever been a turkish delight revel and none of my family remember there being one and coming from a long line of revel lovers from when they were first released im quite positive  xxi love revels too although i wouldnt miss the coffee ones as long as they dont replace them with licorice or raspberries i dont mindalthough i miss prize bars too i was really mean to a guy i was engaged to i sent him into a shop to buy one even though i knew theyd stopped making them hee heerevels revels revels what can i say abut these chocolatey treats theyre just wonderous the best ever tasted the best thing since sliced bread in my opinion maybe there should be a bread revel hmmmmmm interesting thought  yum yum breeeeaaaaadddd anyway i absolutely adore them so hard to choose one to evict as its like christmas in a bag howeverrrr if someone held a gun to my head and forced me to choose then i suppose i would have to kick out the malteaser i know some of you will be gasping right now as the malteaser is a crowd pleaser but i just dont think that it fits in with the chewey soft theme of revels it just stands out like a sore thumb to be honest i just havent got malteaser fever sorry homedogs chocklet revils are sooooooooooooooooooooo nicei have to say that i have not had revels since they introduced raisins i cannot even risk putting a raisin in my mouth they are so disgusting i am hoping raisins get evicted and then i can have them for a treat againhi they took the peanut out many years ago because of the problems with people who may have a problem eating peanuts so we got raisins now i to have to dodge the coffee and now raisin still i like to nibble the chocolate off all of them and save the orange fondent until last and as for the coffee and raisin well i throw the coffee away and let my son have the raisinsthe plain chocolate one should be evicted  deff keep coffee its the best dwas there evr a coconut revel people have been saying there was but i have never heard of onei have never heard of a coconut revel either are they nutsno carvella but there was  anut one hai say vote for strawberryi say vote for lemon mmmmmmto lovellayes there was a coconut revelquite a long time ago thowat about a soft toffee filling for a new revel like in toffee cups remember them folks well i have never heard of the coconut ones it must have been a very long time agoi dont know why i joined this group i dont like revels anyway and i never heard of the cocnut ones elainebut i liked the coffee onesand there is no raisin anymoresorry did i say no raisin meant no peanutsdoes anyone know the new flavour yeti loooooooovvvvvvvvee the carmel revel but i hate the raison and coffee and orangethe mangi just love the surprise factor with revels though im not a fan of the chocolate ones so id bite into the spheric ones gently first to check whats insideif its orange its out my favourite ones are the flat ones i always leave them for laterim confused i had a pack of revels and could figure out what the new flavour was it was soft but not orange i thought it was vanilla or fudge but as a friend was eating her packet she had a strange taste and said it the new one was fudge then to her shock she bit in to another soft one and it was strawberry whats going ondark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to cacao it is chocolate without milk as an additive it is sometimes called plain chocolate the us government has no definition for dark chocolate only sweet chocolate which requires a  concentration of chocolate liquor sweet chocolate is not necessarily dark chocolate as there is no restriction of milk in it european rules specify a minimum of  cocoa solidswaaagh i want one we had a packet today and i remember you could get a full bag of the counter shaped choc oneswe cant remenber what they were called it was in the sdoes anyone know  we thought they might have been called chocolate counters can anyone helpive always thought of the flat chocolates as minstrels without the crisp shell around the outside i checked the wikipedia site and that is exactly what they are but it says they were called galaxy counters which i had never heard ofyeah cheryl youre right everyone on here keeps saying theres chocolate buttons in revels they look like buttons but theyre not chocolate buttons theyre actually here in england for those of you who arent theyre galaxy minstrels without the shell coz thats what minstrells used to be like like the buttons in revels are now but without the shell it was about yrs ago just a guess it was when i was in about nd year high schoolish they added the shell and the slogan melts in ya mouth not in your hand thats for minstrels theyre both made by the mars company revels  minstrels so are maltesers that are in revels as well i wouldnt be surprised that they made them years ago as a one bag mix of there chocolates that were in bags ie  maltesers minstrels and just added the creams and the toffee ones to have more choice in there i mean just having maltesers and minstrels would be a bit boring wouldnt it and i wouldnt be surprised if they never added the shell to the minstrels in revels coz itd look odd with one chocolate in there having a shell and nicola above said they got buttons in nz did you mean cadburys buttons coz they arent the same coz they never had minstrels in nz yrs ago when i lived there another thing you never used to get in nz nicola if you see them as well an english bar which is lush is a drifter also a topic is nice which was virtually the same as the hazelnut mars they had in nz years ago  also a toffee crisp you never got in nz as well look out for them mmmmthe strawberry creams they added as a mystery sweet a while back in revels were lush as well  they should have those in there permanentlyoh and yeah i agree the raisin ones are not too good they should be replaced with the strawberry creamdont add liquorice noooo way  not sure about turkish delight either theyd make the bag stink as the raisins do but definitley a biscuit one and a fudge one would be great  a peanut butter one would be pretty nice i reckon as well now that would be wicked assorment  and get rid of the raisins and bring back the chocolate coated peanuts  they should have maybe  kinds as well one with the chocolate peanuts and one without for those who are allergic still the same weightamount in each bag obviously snd im with amanda the coffee ones are the bestdoes anyone remember the crispy caramel bar in the s terrys who make the chocolate orange made it i think around the same time as the secret was around  lovely  used to be my favourite they only lasted a year or  thoughi like revels and still buy them but they messed it all up by replacing the chocolate covered peanuts with raisonsyes i remember crispy caramelsthey were lovelybut sadly did not last longi think they came in a orange wrapper by terrysyoure the first person ive spoke to anywhere here or in real life that has remembered crispy caramels paddy  why do they always stop nice things like nestle lucky charms he heyeah think yer right paddy they were indeed lovely why do they stop producing the nicest things like the cereal lucky charms beautiful and golden grahamsive just had a packet of revels and i didnt find a new flavour so wots all this about a new flavour and the orange ones are the best they should make a packet of revels with just one flavour but they could only do coffee and orange which would be great so that would suit everyone if they just felt like they wanted one flavourwhat it was emma they stopped doing it now but there was  amystery sweet in revels about a year ago  a strawberry or raspberry cream think one of them was lovelyback when one of the revels had peanuts in them  it literally was like russian roulette if you had an alergy to nutslmao very funny purpose  i guess it would have traces of nut in anyway mind on the other sweets like loli get it dude im allergic when i was a kid my mum had to bite it first to see if it was peanutdoes anybody remember cadburys limited edition orange crisp chocolate what annoys me is that this was limited edition when i was little but it was my favourite chocolate ever  i still cant find anything that lived up to it i cant buy it anywhere only its disguisting partner mint crisp can anyone help
ive always loved dark chocolate and this is green  blacks  exception i cant understand how some people claim not to like it i can only think theyre eating it wronggood quality dark chocolate should be eaten slowly and allowed to melt in the mouth one chunk at a time its about flavour and texture not quantitythe chocolate is smooth without the grainy texture that dark chocolate sometimes has and the flavour is divine not too bitter not too sweetwhatever their secret it works for me highly recommendedps if anyone from green  blacks is reading this do feel free to send us some samples to review please mmm okay id like to try this one please any chance of a care packagebah  oh alright seeing as its you its about flavour and texture not quantitywhich is why i bought the biggest bar of this i couldpmsl  dom you think like mehmm thats probably why i write here tooi love dark chocolate as well unfortunately i happen not to like this theres a peculiar scent in this bar which has sort of put me offhave you tried the dark  lately  every night for the past year ive savored at least  pieces  ive been buying it by the case and its been one of my favorite gift items  the product was dense crisp slow dissolving and completely robust multidimensional in flavor  but the bars i bought this week are bendable somewhat grainy narrow in flavor totally commercial in every way  i noticed the country of manufacture has changed from england to italy  i think cadburys has annhilated this oncesuperior productthis is definitely a favourite with me though i cannot eat a whole bar and the size of the squares make it easy to eat just four of them  mostly every night not too thick and not too thin just right for that slow melting moment on the tongue  mmmm yummythis is one of my alltime favourites and my second favourite by gbs maya gold beats it but only slightly i know its such a waste but i also use this one for baking as it makes muffins cakes and brownies irresistibly chocolatey and smoothhmm a few years late but id just tried this chocolate and i hated it it tasted terrible it was too sour and the chocolate was grainy the melt was also uneven all around sadgreen and blacks was taken over by cadbury who was then taken over by us kraft  i believe the quality of this once fabulous chocolate has suffered its all made in poland now
cadbury twirl is another of those bars that are best served chilled a cadbury twirl is very much like a flake but covered with a smooth layer of chocolate when chilled it crumbles just like a flake but the outer coating helps to stop the crumbles flaking off and going all over your clothesyou get two thin bars in each pack  so you can share if you want yeah right and the chocolate is typical cadburys dairy milk the bars themselves appear to be made by folding very thin layers of chocolate on top of each other leaving plenty of trapped air for that crumbly texture so theyre very lighti quite like the twirl and have occasionally bought it in the past its not the most interesting of chocolate bars but its a nice little treat on a hot summer daymy mouth waters where can i find this so called cadbury twirlanother goodie for chilled chocolate is spira  do they still make thoseyes spira is a great one  i used to like waiting untill my tea had cooled down and then it was posible to drink it through the spira using it as a straw  there was  in a pack  like the blogooo whats a spiraits so nice i cant live without it d phmmm omg id spend all my money on twirlbtw do u get discount on it and do u get a year guatrantee thanks dif only twirl was as good as sex id have it all the timetwirl is also sold in the international section at your local walfart
divine fair trade chocolate is made with ghanaian cocoa beans and bills itself as heavenly chocolate with a heartwhich is all excellent and admirable but to truly give the producers a fair deal the product has to be worth buying too and for me this just doesnt quite do itthe milk chocolate bar i tried was a solid thin bar divided into small chunks the taste is quite chocolately but it lacks any of the creamyness that milk chocolate should have it didnt feel luxurious like expensive chocolate and it didnt give me the quick fix of one of the more common brands all in all i found it quite average it reminded me of the chocolate you sometimes get on cheap nondescript easter eggsmaybe i would have been happier with the plain chocolate version which i intend to review at a later date maybe im just a chocasnob but i really think that they could do so much better with thisif youve tried divine yourself id be very interested in hearing what you thought am i being unfairi tried some last november i thought it was good but not great i found it slightly waxy compared to some other fair trade bars like green  blacks or other upscale brands but it was certainly less grainysweet than a cadbury bar and the price is usually a bit lower than the other upscale brands i seei love divine chocolate all of it but expecially the dark the cocoa butter means it really does melt in your mouth the rich smooth  is to die for definatey the best dark chocolate in the supermarket  i met one of the cocoa farmers involved and they where awesomedom saidmaybe i would have been happier with the plain chocolate version which i intend to review at a later dateim looking forward to that later datejw   past time to review the plain divine dom its good smooth and less bitter than most s also cheaper  asda have it at pbut anyone wanting to economise has missed the boat  earlier in the year asda and tesco had a price war on it and it got below p for a whilei had a divine fruit and nut dark chocolate bar  oz it had good chocolate flavor but it was not very sweet and very cocoa buttery poorly balanced hey if im gonna eat candy i want all the guilt it was very unsatisfiying my wife tasted it later i didnt finish it and she agreed that it was weak wont buy again
late last year mars announced somewhat triumphantly that they would be discontinuing their king sized big one mars and snickers bars due to public concerns about obesity but what they did next was a master stroke  they simply chopped the bars in two and called them duo instead inspiredthe idea so they say is that youre meant to share the two halves so you wont get fatyeah right like im going to share my snickerssnickers is one of those chocolate bars that you just buy when youre hungry and want something to satisfy the chocolate cravings and fill you up you dont necessarily think about it you just know youre going to be left satisfiedi never really had an issue with the big one bars  if people are stupid enough to think they can eat nothing but chocolate all day and not get fat well its their own fault but i actually prefer the duo format it allows you to eat half put the kettle on then settle down with a nice cup of tea and have the other half without leaving messy half eaten chocolate bars lying aroundproperly cooled to just below room temperature the caramel is yummy if slightly sticky and the choclate is thick and breaks into nice chunks when you bite into it the very slightly salty peanuts just bring the whole thing together into one delicious bar or two bars in this casechewy tasty unpretentious and filling i love it this blog is excellent i am full of envy as american chocolate is totally different than uk chocolate not worse just different and we can almost never get your chocolate did you know that snickers is really food not candy the great state of new jersey taxes candy but not snickers bars because they contain flour which makes them food thats got to be why you feel full after you eat onethanks for the compliment we have similar strange laws in the uk  biscuits cookies are subject to vat sales tax but cakes arent  mcvities went to court to prove that jaffa cakes were cakes not biscuits  which they wonhmm gonna have to review jaffa cakes nextsnickers yum when youre hungry its where its at lets deep fry it its been  years since you posted that comment and i still have not done itis snickers just a mars bar with peanutspr a topic with peanuts maybechocoholic the snickers nougat is actually quite sugary and more like nougat than the marschocodude definitely get a snickers you will not be disappointedaww im craving a snickers right nowwww theyre so scrumptious and tasty and a little taste of heavensnickers are gorgeous sweet and because of the nuts savoury at the same timequite a manly bar  sorry to sound sexist but i love them theyre gorgeous
continuing with my back to basics chocolate bar campaign the next on the shopping list was the bounty barnow i must be particularly susceptible to advertising as just the glimpse of the split coconut azure waters and leafy palm trees on the wrapper sends me off into my own little daydream where im lying in a hammock in the tropics slowly eating a chocolate bar sipping a cocktail and having my own rather hunky adonis fanning me with palm leavesahem where was i  oh yes the bounty barthe first thing you need to know about this chocolate bar is of vital importance  bounty bars must be eaten straight out of the fridge  some chocolate bars are quite flexible and while not optimum it doesnt really matter if you buy it off a warm shelf in your local newsagent and eat it at your desk a few hours later but a tepid bounty bar is an unloved bounty bar  and pretty flavourlessso youre in your tropical daydream youve got your suitably chilled bounty bar in front of you you rip off the wrapper enthusiastically  what do you findinside you get two mini bars of bounty  each about cm long cm wide and cm deep  the chocolate on the top is pleasantly rippled presumably echoing the waves on our tropical fantasy beach and the base has the word bounty and palm trees repeatedly printed on the bottom  just in case you were in danger of forgetting what you were eatingbiting into it if you fridged it properly as instructed you get a nice crunch of milk chocolate  a satisfyingly thick coating  the chocolate is not a mere afterthought in a bounty bar  the interior coconut filling is soft moist and beautifully coconutty  however it should be said that the milk chocolate coating is slightly sweeter than say cadbury dairy milk chocolate which is a little disappointing as it doesnt offer as much contrast to the subtle flavours of the coconut filling as it might  despite being a diehard milk chocolate fan i suspect i might get on better with the dark chocolate version in this instancethe bad news is that the mini bar is snaffled within a couple of bites  the good news  theres a second bar to follow  when theyre both gone i am left feeling nice and full and chocolate cravings are satisfied so im not immediately raiding the fridge for another oneso on the whole the bounty bar is a worthy classic of the confectionary aisle but only if eaten properly chilledcompletely agree  bounty just has to be eaten cold for that chocolate crunch i prefer the dark chocolate version though mmmmmyes the bounty bar is a heavenly treat i enjoy most chocolate bars straight out of the frig thanks for sharing these yummy blog poststheres nothing quite like a bounty both milk and dark are wonderful you have to like coconut though and if you do the bounty is like a little piece of heaven and whats more there are  of them in every pack its the complete package for the chocolate bar conoisseurim still bitter about the change from the wax paper wraper to plastic it was a sad day indeed its deliciooooouuuuuusssssi would like to point out that blue bounty bars are the superior chocolate taste sensation i feel sorry for those stuck on the wrong side the dark side those red eaters need help please set up a fund called the help little sophie off the red ones fundall donations will go towards blue bountys which will be fed to little sophie in an attempt to recondition her mind filled with dark chocolate evil thoughts when did they remove the cardboard tray these delicious bars used to sit inwhy not just get a bounty ice cream if you like cold bountystoo bad that here in holland they only sell the bar with the  small bars in the package since a couple years ago i have so many fond memories of the old  solid bar you know its nostalgic for memay i have permission to mention bounty bars in my novel bully boys by maisie thomas printed by trafford publishing  the text is as followsshe hung them on the tree using paper clips and placed a few miniature chocolate bars of aero crunchie bounties and cadburys twirls that shed raided from the fridge at home and placed them on the bare branches  after placing a few crackers here and there the tree didnt look too bad even if she said so herself many thanks for your assistancei love this chocolate  i used to live in europe and it was sold in every grocery store  now that i live in new york i find it difficult to find the bars  even though i love the milk and the dark chocolate bars the milk bar is more commonly found even though its really rare as well and therefore the one that i eat most often  i wish the chocolate was more readily available in the states  it remains my favorite since early childhoodits my favorite chocolate in the world im  and wen i was little i used to sneak of to the shop with alot of money and started to buy tons of them loli love it love love love who else loves it bounty rocksthey are very nice on a hot summer day sometimes the simple things are the bestyammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmyes dom i agree with youis it halaldose bounty contains any ingredients whic is made out of any animal product is it halal or kosher certifiedi like bounty bcoz of d awesome tasteevryone shld taste thisi just grabbed a  pack today mmmm yummers  i just them in the fridge  i will crack into those a lil later tonight  my gf just loves bounty bars  i was watching survivor man the other night and he was on a tropical island eating coconuts guess we got a cravingi lovedddddddddddddddddddddddddddd itttttttttttttttttti love bountyyumbut with all the limited editions of chocolate bars they have out there i think bounty should do onemaybe with pieces of dried fruit in itlike the cabanna bars i remember when i was smallthey were lushfroth froth froth froth frothi love to eathemi was once travelled back in time to eat one of these bad boys they dont make them in the future then my younger self and his legend buddies saw me and then i had to go in to the convenience mart where my time machine isi want to work in an investment bank and eat bounties all day  i reckon that would be ronnie red hoti love bounties they are perfectly sweet and the coconut in the centre is creamy and rich and soft the desiccated pieces are mushed together so you dont get that horrible crunchy taste mind you you have to get them straight from the fridge so that the chocolate is still hard and crisp try it on a hot dayits lush
sometimes its nice to have a change from the usual you spend ten minutes browsing the vast array of chocolate in the local sweet shop but nothing really grabs youand then you see it something newdoesnt look british or american it must be goodyou grab it from the shelf and run home like a little chiild half way home you think it might be a good idea to go back and pay the shopkeeper which kind of spoils the momentwhere was i oh yes ritter sport cappuccinowhen you do finally get this home the first thing you notice when you open it is the overwhelming coffee smell for coffee addicts this is going to be heaven then you have to decide how to eat it something thats always fun when you dont know whats inside the milk chocolate chunksso you close your eyes and take a big bite  mmmmmmmfor some reason i was expecting some kind of biscuit but this is soft and creamy all the way through and its rather delicious the chocolate is smooth and delicious and the filling is creamy and very very cappuccinoy thats a real word honeston a recent trip to the uk i purchased a variety of chocolates for the long plane ride home a ritter sport cappuccino among them oh my god heaven i am desperately seeking a supplier here in the us help
i am  years old and i still cant stop myself humming that little ditty every time i unwrap a cadburys fudge  that either says something about how effective the advertising campaign was or something about my childishness either way i cant help but feel a small amount of excitement at unwrapping the barhow best to describe the humble cadburys fudge  the perennial kid favourite  the fudge bar itself is a dshaped finger cm long and about cm at its widest point coated in a thin layer of cadburys chocolate  smooth on the top and a sort of rough regular texture on the bottom which looks like it sat on mesh while the chocolate seton biting into the bar the overwhelming flavour is that of the buttery sweetness of the fudge  not as sophisticated or creamy as true fresh fudge of course but still has a satisfying and moreish quality  the chocolate to fudge ratio is a little on the mean side but enough to complement the fudge nicelyat the end of the finger which sadly you reach all too soon youre left feeling mmm i could eat another one of those  maybe a cadburys fudge is enough of a treat for a child but for the adult chocaholics among us id thoroughly recommend buying them in a multipack of i believe youve created your own lyrics as a result of your insane cravings for morehighly probably  god i love the interneti had a fudge this arvo bliey they have become thinthe fudge advert was well sinister the one with the musical jingle on used to maybe still does freak me out because it sent people mentala finger of fudge is just enough to send to round the bendanyone know where i can find a giant cadburys fudge strange request i know its not for mea finger of fudge is just enough to insert up your fudgeholedid i just say that out loudthis cadbury fudge is amazing i love iti love fudges they def need to make a bigger one
sometimes not often i think there are just too many different kinds of chocolate to choose from today is one of those timesthe wrapper calls it milk chocolate with a rippled wafer surrounded by caramel cream and chocolate cream i call it a bit dullwhile theres noting actually wrong with mars delight its really just another crispy chewy chocolate bar in a crowded market judging by the packaging and the price its trying to be a little more upmarket than the average chocolate bar but it doesnt really workdull really  mars delight is definitely my favorite chocolate bar  unfortunately im no longer in the uk where theyre available  found your blog through boingboing who posted the chocolate dalek  fun stuffwoop woop chocolate i luv itim dissapointe dwith masterfoods on their mess up with the  new ingredients bring the old one backkinder bueno is little baby for mars delight its the most wonderful candy but it is little expensive
 grams of heaven thats what this iswhich is just as well as the guy in the shop is obviously becoming concerned by the volume and diversity of chocolate ive been consuming lately  luckily he hasnt called chocaholics anonymous yet so i think im ok for a whileanyway  back to the matter in handi dont usually buy galaxy as i find the chocolate a little too creamy compared to cadburys  so i wasnt expecting to like this but the caramel really makes a difference it definitely has more flavour to it than cadburys dairy milk with caramel and i think its a less sticky too so no long sticky strings of caramelly goo to wipe from my keyboard this time yayer maybe thats just mebeing an adventurous type i tried two different ways of eating this thats why they give you two bars right first i let the chunks just melt on my tongue which was very nice but then i discovered i could bite the ends of the chunks and suck the caramel from the centreim not entirely sure why i found this so exciting i think its probably down to living alone and not having anyone to slap me round the back of the head and tell me to stop being such a slob  or maybe just maybe i have been eating too much chocolate latelyis that possiblei absolutly luv galaxy caramels id buyu the factory if i couldi absolutly luv galaxy caramels id buy the factory if i couldi love this chocolate too ive been buying mine at amazoncom they ship right away and ive been buying other cadburys and british chocolate from there toolovee itgrrrrr der mys amy nash loves galaxy caramelshttpdoingitgerardwaybebocomlove them  immm there soo kool manmmmmmmmmm they r emence mmmmmmmdvery unhappy with my galaxy caramel when i purchased my choclate it only one row of choclate when there should be two i really like the chocolate but this is the second time this has happened and i am not pleased could you please get back to me as i would like to discuss this matter furtherdear mr turnerplease buy a bigger bar and let us know if the problem continuesi luuuuuuuuuuuv caramel please send me a box get back and al tell you my adress there the best thats all i buy come oan the caramel makers u guys rock i love caramel chocalteeeeeeeeeeeeeeomg i lv galaxy caramel aaahhh i eat it the same way woo xxxgalaxy caramel is amazing aint nothing likt it i wanna buy boxes of the stuff if i knew where to goi have only tasted the galaxy s ant i loved it xomg galaxy caramels r the best chocs ever theyre all i eatsaddonot very many place have them why im loving the eggs aswell but theyre both very hard to buy what are the main shopsdoes anybody know if galaxy caramel can be bought in a bigger bar than the little two finger bar lease thanks xxxoo i love this choco its amazing l oi love caramel chocolates  galaxy caramel is yummmmmmmmmiiiiiieeeeone of the nicest bars in the world mine and my girl friends favhmmmmmmmmm i love galaxy chocolates my favoritte iiiiissss galaxy caramel
the first thing you notice about kinder bueno is just how light it is  luckily it comes in a two bar pack otherwise im sure it would just float awaybueno consists of a creamy slightly nutty filling sitting on a thin layer of wafer wrapped in milk chocolate thats proper milk chocolate made with cocoa butter for those of you that dont like british chocolate which is made with vegetable fati have to say im not a big fan of wafers they serve no real purpose and have never contributed anything meaningful to the world but in this case it kinda worksthe filling is so creamy and soft that it needs a little crispiness just to set it off while keeping the whole thing very lightwhen i first opened it i didnt think  it would  be substantial enough but having finished it it left me satisfied without wanting to immediately go out and buy anotherdont expect bueno to fill you up but if you want a treat or a midmorning snack this is perfectdiscovered bueno bars while on a vactation in italy  theyre the bestyou can find it in canada tooi know im addcited also give meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeei just thought i should tell you guys im in france and theyre selling white chocolate kinder buenos i have a pack of three on my deskoh mon dieuu this is the best chocolate in the hoolee worldmmmm kinder bueno just hits the spot  bring it on yum yum yum i buy kinder bueno every day when i go shoppingi eating now kinder buenothe endmy sister got this one day and i thought no then i went and bought it myself one day and now im have to say nothing comes close to thisthis is just so yummy and creamy and im having one now as i speak thankyou so much this is heavenlyone more thing i can just go on about this choclateyou will have to try this once you do you do not wanna share this to anyoneeven to your nearest and dearest onesomg i love this chocalate the bestiam always king with kinder buenocan you please give the name of shops where you got the kinder bueno in south africa my boyfriend brought me this from france and im trying to loicate this in sa to no avail please helpi agree white kinder buenos could easily be considerd a world class chocolate snack they are a league above the regular ones in my opinionthis chocolet is the best chocolet selling i could live on it every one i no has agreed with me about this yazminlouise gloveragree with everyone here this must be the best chocolate bar in the world never tried the white version dont think they sell it where i live vancouver canadai buy them in pack of twenties at costco i pay only  for that cheap and so addicted i finished the pack of twenties in  days lolps eat one wait no two no wait eat as much as possiblewhere can i buy kinder bueno i am in new jersey usinform me by email where can i buy kinder bueno in new jersey usbuenas tardes no encuentro en los puntos de venta las papeletas para pegar los puntos que tengo acumulados desde hace un tiempo asi que espero que orienten sobre este asunto por favor espero su respuesta lo mas pronto osible gracias por su atencionleker buenobueno super het is superi just quit smoking for about  months and kinder bueno has been one hell of a subtitutes price for  packs is about the same as my pack of ciggies i dont know what they put in that bar but it sure kill my nicotine cravekinder maxi is betterqafa  we need to hook upthey need white and brown chocolate tgether like the eggs thatd be world classif heaven  amazingness had a baby it would be named kinder buenothis chocolate was made by the gods themselves i would not share this bar with a starving child this is the best chocolate everi could eat this chocolate all day and night yum yum yummmit does fill you up if you eat enoughomgone of the best treats ever i discovered kinder bueno bars in italy  france instant addiction and lo and behold world market here in san diego ca now sells themi love kinder so much i am adicted  thx to the guy who invented it i absoulutely love this chocolate i dont really like the white but i love the milk one its soo yummy i just ate one now i feel so unhealthy after eating onei really love this chocolatei really love this choclate i am eating this chocolate since when i was small i especially love the white milk inside itit is best chocolatei love this chocolate very muchthis chocolate is the best in the world but in sudan its so expensivethis is soooo life changing  im sure its the same story with everyone really had my first one disliking it  i was dumb but after a few minutes of convincing from my sis i instantly found my life this is the number one chocolate and is heaven in a bar buy one you wont regret it im eating one as i type yum
im not entirely sure i approve of this the people at mars  masterfoods were obviously high when they came up with the idea for this because its a chocolate bar aimed at dieterstaste the chocolate skip some fat and half the fat of solid block milk chocolate it proudly proclaims on the wrapper but in reality its just a slightly choclatier milky way thats  musketeers if youre in the us  and it contains almost exactly the same calorie content kcal  gthis seems eversoslightly cynical to me i can just picture some bright spark in the marketing department coming up with the idea to repackage an existing product to extract even more money from the publichaving said that  i really quite liked it  ive always liked the fluffiness of milky way and this is just that little bit chocolatier you get two mini bars in each pack and theyre just the right size to stuff into your mouth whilst grinning like a manic  year old erm  probablyif you like milky way or mars bars give these a go but if youre on a diet i seriously doubt it will help muchdid you get this in the uk or somewhere elsein the uk my local shop looks good  any way i can skip some of the fat is good for me  thank you for the postwhat is flyte ive never heard of itbut in reality its just a slightly choclatier milky way thats  musketeers if youre in the usactually that statement is incorrect the milky way has a ribbon of caramel in itthe  musketeers is just the nougatthe reason you think that these taste a bit like the uk milky ways is because they used to be the uk milky waywhen the flyte bar came out they changed the recipe of the uk milky way to make them creamier and whiter allowing the flyte bar to have its own new place as a lower fat bar in the marketanyone who used to love milky ways in the eighties but find milky ways now to be too sickly like i do should have one of these and the memories will come flooding backsaying that i havent noticed flyte bars around for ages and i am wondering if they have been discontinued does anyone know or am i just shopping in the wrong placesim not surehi which boots do you get your flytes from  the one in basingstoke seems to have stopped selling them thanks annlook ere fattys u wanna lose weight stop eatingi agree with comments made by alison as a life long chocholic brought up on many great choccie products from the s onwards in the uk i concur also that flyte is what the original uk milky bar tasted like i also agree that mars wasted the milky way by making it sickly and cloying with that horrible white ok we know its names milky way stuff so im just glad we can still get flyte barsas a postscript whats happened to good old britainweve sold our heritage for a mess of pottage biblical quote by that i mean we dont own and manufacture any of our great british companies and products any more eg confectionary cadbury rowntrees mackintosh etc cars morris austin mg leyland   radios and tvsbush etcdo you remember cadburys caramello it came in  versions dairy milk chocolate milk chocolate with a scrape of caramel and milk chocolate and creamy caramel milk chocolate with soft flowing caramel it was very nicehi anyone know where to buy these in basingstoke please
anyway after much hunting creme egg bars aka cadbury dairy milk with creme egg have suddenly appeared in all my local shops and i have taken it upon myself to buy them alli also noticed the fondant appears to be much more orange than the fondant in proper creme eggs im not entirely sure why but im sure theres a good scientific explanationat the moment these bars appear to only be available in g size obviously this isnt enough so i have taken to buying at least  at once but the best thing about these is simply the fact that theyre bars unwrapping real creme eggs in public can be a messy experience and often leads to humiliation when you end up with fondant all over your face while on the busits not much to ask is ityes it patently is too much to asklet us know when they start making them wont youim fascinated by the creation of the creme egg barwhere are you located at theres no about page is this a ukonly thingyes were in the uk but im sure youll find them over there at some pointmmmm i like creme eggs i could slaughter a dozen right nowwhat a tasty blog   those look fabulous  i hope they do make it to the usmaybe you can help me with a question i have  when i was a kid in hong king  or  times i encoutered a cadbury chocolate bar that had raised shapes with fillings inside  as i recall there was a raised orange slice filled with orange creme maybe a strawberry with strawb creme  i dont remember how many sections there were though  i thought it was called milk tray but googling that only produces info on a boxed assortment and im sure this was a bar  in hk we got a lot of things that were packaged for uk or australia so it may have been something that was somewhat exclusive  any ideaser that would be hong kong pwas it frys chocolate cream  orange cream  peppermint creamhttpwwwbagofsweetscommanufacturerphpmancadbury own frys so it could be branded differently in other countriesi bow to your superior knowledge obviously it was before my time oi respect for your elders please it was a milk tray bar  i finally found it referenced somewhere im doing a project for school and i need to find out legal requirements for cadburys creme egg if anyone know of a good website please could you let me know many thankx casperover here in australia we have a cadbury snack bar which has sections of different flavours including orange strawberry pineapple caramel turkish delight and coconut ice its available in family sized blocks as well as individual bars would this be the equivalent of your milk tray bari wish we had a bar like that in the uk i adore cream eggs they are soft and creamy and tastywhat youre all looking for is the cadbury creme egg twisted  yarrrrrmmmo

the most simple of all chocolate reviews  cadbury chocolate buttonsyou all love them but maybe you feel embarrassed about buying them for yourself simple have a childa bit drastic you may think well anyone who has had chocolate buttons will disagree but if you have yet to try them what kind of life have you had and cant wait the nine months simply announce in a loud voice that you are buying the  bags of chocolate buttons for your niecenephewwhy  bags i hear you ask well there can be a problem with these delectable reasons for living when chubby little fingers try to open the little bag the bag can tear and the buttons can fall to the pavement im not wishing to give you nightmares but it does happen and its only fair to warn youthere is nothing more heartbreaking than seeing  chocolate buttons in a puddle on the pavement producing a second bag can in my experience help stop the tearschocolate buttons are made from the same chocolate as any bar of cadbury dairy milk but they taste so much better i have no clue why maybe there is some scientific reason involving surface mass and tongue temperature maybe its magic i dont care what the reason is do youi think its just cause they are more bite size  they sure are deliciousvery true even i couldnt figure out why the buttons are more delicious than any normal cadbury barconspiracythe recipe is slightly different i think sugar is the st listed ingredient in dairy milk but it isnt listed st in buttons at least it was last time i lookedi think youll find the first listed ingredient in dairy milk is milk lol and buttons are called dairy milk buttons so it is the same recipe  think it must be just down to the size of the buttons  im fond of them myself lolit all has to do with the surface area  the round button covers so much more of the tongue than the triangular shaped piece bitten off from the bar let me try another one  yup im right  feel free to do you own testingcheck out my english pantrycom it is a great place to get cadbury buttons and other english foodhttpwwwmyenglishpantrycomeveryone loves these xd i have three bags d you do need two bags yes but becasue they taste so good xdi think youll find the first listed ingredient in dairy milk is milk lol and buttons are called dairy milk buttons so i imagine it is the same recipe  think it must be just down to the size of the buttons  im fond of them myself lolthey used to taste fabulous but have you tasted them recently quality has gone right down and now they have none of that delicious chocolateyness i used to adore perhaps kraft have killed themthey taste exactly the same as they always have  to me lol theyre just dairy milk afterall and thats the same maybe its your taste buds
upon seeing the new tchibo chocolate display at the local somerfield i couldnt resist trying out a new chocolate bar yes you read that right just one bari wasnt feeling especially sophisticated i was more in the need for a bit of selfish indulgence i think i chose the perfect bari chose tchibo san vicente full cream milk  cocoa solids chocolatebefore attacking the chocolate i noticed the wrapper states  sheer chocolate indulgence so far so goodmade from the finest cocoa from the best regions of venezuela and formed into a slender bar this chocolate does appear to be rather grown up too grown up to put the kids off well im not taking any chances i shall be hiding these beauties at the back of the cupboard we all do that dont we dont wesheer chocolate indulgence yes it certainly does what it says on the wrapper comfort eating for grown upsohh man  that sounds sooo gooood  im going to go buy some right awaytoldja it was good didnt immmm i have just polished off a nice big bar of ityummy
i think i must have had a bad experience with aero as a child i have never particularly liked them but im not entirely sure why i assume i was once given one and expected the bubbles to be fizzy and i never quite got over the disappointment so it was with some trepidation that i decided to try mint aeroand i have to say im still disappointedthe mint bubbles taste a bit artificial and have a slightly strange aftertaste and  more importantly  theres just not enough chocolate mm of chocolate does not make a satisfying chocsperience in my bookanother minor annoyance is that despite being divided into handy chunks the mint aero refuses to break along them no matter how much i try i find myself being showered with minty crumbles no matter how i try to eat ithaving said all that i did eat it all but it wasnt a totally satisfying experience if you want minty chocolate i suggest after eights and if you want bubbles join my one man campaign to bring back cadburys wispathat is not a chocolate that has come over the pond i dont thinki cant imagine that id be excited about any bubbles in my candy that arent  pop rocksthe whole thing makes me think of calgon and bubble bathis it meant to be like a crispy kind of thing rather than fizzy  like a us nestle crunchoh my god i love wispa it has been twenty years since i visited england on a summer vacation with my family and i still think about these things bubbles in chocolate are fun because they make it sort of crumbly and soft  they give it an interesting texturebut also  the internets tell me that there is a cadbury bar with bubbles in it named something innocuous about milk chocolate is that similar to the wispabring back wispadoes the dairy milk bubbly not count as a wispa theyre essentially the same thingexcept the wispa was less dairymilk more bubbles and it had nice flavours egmint caramel and orangetrue that i dont remember much of the wispa anyway so im not too bothered about it but i hear that many people arei dont really remember that the wispa either i just always remember waking up on christmas morning to find one of each in a selection box in my stocking dthere is no replacement for wispa not even the aerodid you have to remind me about the wispa where can i get one from hee heei think they are dicontinued now  i sit sobbing ha joking but they should come back i insisti really like the aero just as i love my flake i actually like the mildness of the chocolate versus the overly sweet american chocolateevery time i go to ireland i always buy a case of flake to bring home nothing quite like a  back in the ole country now that ive tried aero i think i will need to ask some relatively to bring some back for me next trip they takei dont think ive ever heard of a wispa but i luv aeros i dont see wats wrong with iti love areo mint when ever i get home i run to the shops to buy one and the same with everydaymate you should have got paid for advertising aeroaero mint is the best chocolate bar ever  maybe cuz i love mint but the choc bar is awesome quite sensational to me xdjust found a bar of mint aero for sale in braslia brazil an uk import bought and loved it i want morejust finished my latest chocolate party  the nestle aero minty bubbles chocolate bar ended up th  im not a mint fan but have to say that the texture was excellent  cant wait to try a another aero with a different flavori love aeroi recently got back from a trip to dublin and i brought my kids a selection of chocolate bars my youngest lilly was so excited because the mint aero bar i got broke in the middle there was great excitment has anyone else had a mint earo do this a m y a mis amigas nos encanta el aero de menta lo probamos a un viaje a londres y aqu en espaa no sabemos donde lo venden podra alguien decirme si conoce algn sitio donde lo vendan o si alguien lo puede enviarlo por correo por favor si alguien lo sabe que conteste cuanto antes bssoh and by the way the aero word had the words airated milk chocolate for the chocolate version and airated milkmint chocolate for the mint version also in the s an advertisement for the chocolate version appeared in which kids flying a kite imagined the kite was an aero bar and bubbles flew out of the bar to form the wrapping for the chocolate version also the two bars were avalible in the cadburys dairy box that contained cadburys milk chocolates so thats all on the history of the uk aero bar folks in fact the bar was divided into twelve chunks compared to the seven on todays nestl aero barcould you please email me egg free and vegetarian list for yor products as i have cant eat egg products because of the alergy and i am a vegetarian
a g bag of cadbury creme egg minis gives you five small eggsthere are two plus points to the size one they are still big enough to bite if you are daintily inclined and two they are small enough to eat in one go allowing the egg the melt wholeheartedlysatisfaction is totally missing after one egg and to be perfectly honest the satisfied feeling one gets from the real creme egg experience just doesnt occur even after all fiveperhaps its the chocolate fondant ratio that is wrong maybe the intentions were good with the making of these eggs and in theory the ratio should work but all of the five eggs from this packet had a large air pocket where fondant filling should have beenthinking about it id much prefer giant creme eggs proper easter egg size with fondantid pay good money for one of themewwwwtoo much yellowi agree totally with the unsatisfying experience of creme egg minis  they just dont hit the spot in quite the same way and like you i suspect its the fondantchcolate ratio is awry somewhereooooi love these especially the g bags mmm delicious just too temptingly moreish like the standard ones ppo id much rather have the mini eggs  the ones that are covered in a yummy crispy shell  i can eat a whole g bag in one sitting
despite the fact that an ex boyfriend ran off with another woman and bought her a cadbury crme egg every day as a romantic gesture cadbury creme egg still remains a favourite of minemaybe i just dont get attached to guys maybe it was the fact that she didnt actually like crme eggs and gave them to her friend rather than tell him or maybe its simply that crme eggs are just so darn good that not even a broken heart can spoil their chocolatey lovelinessi started taking crme eggs seriously when i was  years old i made a chart for my bedroom wall where i noted all relevant details of each crme egg i had i would then glue the foil wrapper onto another chart by the side of it i have no clue whatsoever what the relevant details were but i think my aim was to prove how many eggs i could eat i wasnt in competition with anyone else so that automatically made me the crme egg championactually i lie i wasnt ten when my egg obsession started i was actually about  the only way to eat the egg when i was five was to nibble down slowly until i revealed the crme egg as it should be a perfect circle of chocolate surrounding the creamy white fondant filling and in the middle had to be an unsmudged golden yellow yolki would drive my mum nuts with this fad as i insisted she showed much glee at each and every yolkachievement i madethese days i am a bit more private about my crme egg escapades this year i shall be mainly eating my eggs in two halves instructions  im not sure if you know about these or not but cadburys have just released a creme egg bar woolworths are the exclusive stockist for the next few weeks but after that itll be all over as a fellow creme egg slave i felt compelled to share the news  enjoycadbury cream eggs are the best ever  they start appearing around middle of january  i try to resist but so far after  years no can do  so i look forward to this time of year when will my cream eggs appear on store shelves  everyone should at least try one but bet you cant resist just onecream eggsmmmdelish i know what you mean about the yellow bit in the middle how about cream egg with dark chocolate
two good things happen when the christmas holidays end one the kids go back to school leaving their selection boxes unattended and two easter eggs appear in the shopsif you fall prey to chocolate related guilt then cadbury mini eggs are ones for you the bright packaging is void of any chocolatey pictures therefore you are quite justified in claiming you believed the pack to contain simply eggs and we all need protein right need an extra guilt squasher blame it on the product placement designed to make shoppers impulse buy mini eggs are usually found near the checkouts in the supermarket or on the counter in smaller shops so its hardly your fault that you automatically purchased one or two packs is itthe two packs i have in front of me for research purposes obviously are the g pack a bit difficult to open without tearing but i just rip it and empty them in a dish you cannot risk these eggs falling to the floor and the plastic tube with a flip lid i imagine the flip lid is designed to keep any uneaten mini eggs fresh did the designers not even try the eggs before wasting their time creating something that simply would never get used it takes a matter of minutes to consume these eggs therefore once that fliptop has been flipped it will never get a chance to be flopped back downof course the plastic tubes can be used for other things once emptied of their contents for eg building blocks they will keep your childrenhusband amused for hours as they build a life size eiffel tower  with them so go on be a good friendpartnerparent and provide lots and lots of empty mini egg tubes i like mini creme eggs betterdont forget the minieggs that are maltedyumdid you know that you can melt the minieggs for  minute in the microwave and have melty chocolate with a crunch shellheaventhese are my favorite too   they had them at christmas this year   not good  i ate several bags all myself i might addhas anyone noticed that they have changed the recipie of the shell  they are much harder more candy like and not as tasty as they used to beyes taken over by hersheys i find them sub par the chocolate is not good either  not cadbury quality
